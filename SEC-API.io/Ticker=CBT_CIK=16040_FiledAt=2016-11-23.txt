Business 

General 

Cabot is a global specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Our principal products are rubber and specialty grade carbon blacks, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, activated carbons, inkjet colorants, aerogel, and cesium formate drilling fluids. Cabot and its affiliates have manufacturing facilities and operations in the United States and over 20 other countries. Cabot&#8217;s business was founded in 1882 and incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1960. The terms &#8220;Cabot&#8221;, &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, and &#8220;our&#8221; as used in this report refer to Cabot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Our vision is to be the most innovative, respected and responsible leader in our markets &#8211; delivering performance that makes a difference. Our strategy is to extend our leadership in performance materials by investing for growth in our core businesses, driving application innovation with our customers, and generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization. Our products are generally based on technical expertise and innovation in one or more of our four core competencies: making and handling very fine particles; modifying the surfaces of very fine particles to alter their functionality; designing particles to impart specific properties to a formulation; and combining particles with other ingredients to deliver a formulated performance intermediate or composite. We focus on creating particles with the composition, morphology, and surface functionalities, and creating formulations of those particles, to deliver the requisite performance to support our customers&#8217; existing and emerging applications. 

Our four business segments are: Reinforcement Materials; Performance Chemicals; Purification Solutions; and Specialty Fluids. The business segments are discussed in more detail later in this section. Financial information about our business segments appears in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 below (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) and in Note U of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below (&#8220;Note U&#8221;).

Reinforcement Materials 

Products 

Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications. Rubber grade carbon blacks are used to enhance the physical properties of the systems and applications in which they are incorporated. 

Our rubber blacks products are used in tires and industrial products. Rubber blacks have traditionally been used in the tire industry as a rubber reinforcing agent to increase tread durability and are also used as a performance additive to reduce rolling resistance and improve traction. In industrial products such as hoses, belts, extruded profiles and molded goods, rubber blacks are used to improve the physical performance of the product, including the product&#8217;s physical strength, fluid resistance, conductivity and resistivity. 

In addition to our rubber blacks products, we manufacture compounds of carbon black and rubber using our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process. These compounds improve abrasion/wear resistance, reduce fatigue and reduce rolling resistance compared to carbon black/rubber compounds made by conventional dry mix methods.

Sales and Customers 

Sales of rubber blacks products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. Sales to three major tire customers represent a material portion of Reinforcement Materials&#8217; total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could have a material adverse effect on the Segment. 

Under appropriate circumstances, we have entered into supply contracts with certain customers, the typical duration of which is one year. Many of these contracts provide for sales price adjustments to account for changes in relevant feedstock indices and, in some cases, changes in other relevant costs (such as the cost of natural gas). In fiscal 2016, approximately half of our rubber blacks volume was sold under these supply agreements. The majority of the volumes sold under these agreements are sold to customers in North America and Europe. 

We have licensed our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process to Manufacture Francaise des Pneumatiques Michelin for their exclusive use in tire applications through fiscal 2017. As consideration, we receive quarterly royalty payments extending through calendar year 2022. 

Much of the rubber blacks we sell is used in tires and automotive products and, therefore, our financial results may be affected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. However, a large portion of the market for our products is in replacement tires that historically have been less subject to automotive industry cycles. 

Competition 

We are one of the leading manufacturers of carbon black in the world. We compete in the manufacture of carbon black primarily with two companies with a global presence and numerous other companies that operate regionally, some of which export product outside their region. Competition for products within Reinforcement Materials is based on product performance, quality, reliability, price, service, technical innovation, and logistics. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, global manufacturing presence, operations and logistics excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw material used in the manufacture of carbon black is a portion of the residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of carbon black. Raw materials are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. Raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of carbon black feedstock and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials, and related transportation costs. Importantly, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. 

Operations

We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce rubber blacks in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands and the United States. Our equity affiliate operates a carbon black plant in Venezuela.

Performance Chemicals 

Performance Chemicals is composed of two businesses: (i) our Specialty Carbons and Formulations business, which manufactures and sells specialty grades of carbon black, specialty compounds and inkjet colorants, and (ii) our Metal Oxides business, which manufactures and sells fumed silica, fumed alumina and dispersions thereof and aerogel. In Performance Chemicals, we design, manufacture and sell materials that deliver performance in a broad range of customer applications across the automotive, construction and infrastructure, energy, inkjet printing, electronics, and consumer products sectors. 

Products 

Specialty Carbons and Formulations Business

Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications.

Our specialty grades of carbon black are used to impart color, provide rheology control, enhance conductivity and static charge control, provide UV protection, enhance mechanical properties, and provide formulation flexibility through surface treatment. These specialty carbon products are used in a wide variety of applications, such as inks, coatings, plastics, adhesives, toners, batteries, and displays. 

Our masterbatch and conductive compound products, which we refer to as &#8220;specialty compounds&#8221;, are formulations derived from specialty grades of carbon black mixed with polymers and other additives. These products are generally used by plastic resin producers and converters in applications for the automotive, industrial, packaging, consumer products, and electronics industries. As an alternative to directly mixing specialty carbon blacks, these formulations offer greater ease of handling and help customers achieve their desired levels of dispersion and color and manage the addition of small doses of additives. In addition, our electrically conductive compound products generally are used to reduce risks associated with electrostatic discharge in plastics applications.

Our inkjet colorants are high-quality pigment-based black and color dispersions based on our patented carbon black surface modification technology. The dispersions are used in aqueous inkjet inks to impart color, sharp print characteristics and durability, while maintaining high printhead reliability. These products are used in various inkjet printing applications, including commercial printing, small office/home office and corporate office, and niche applications that require a high level of dispersibility and colloidal stability. Our inkjet inks, which utilize our pigment-based colorant dispersions, are used in the commercial printing segment for digital print. 

Metal Oxides Business

Fumed silica is an ultra-fine, high-purity particle used as a reinforcing, thickening, abrasive, thixotropic, suspending or anti-caking agent in a wide variety of products for the automotive, construction, microelectronics, batteries, and consumer products industries. These products include adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, inks, toners, silicone rubber, coatings, polishing slurries and pharmaceuticals. Fumed alumina, also an ultra-fine, high-purity particle, is used as an abrasive, absorbent or barrier agent in a variety of products, such as inkjet media, lighting, coatings, cosmetics and polishing slurries. 

Aerogel is a hydrophobic, silica-based particle with a high surface area that is used in a variety of thermal insulation and specialty chemical applications. In the building and construction industry, the product is used in insulative sprayable plasters and composite building products, as well as translucent skylight, window, wall and roof systems for insulating eco-daylighting applications. In the specialty chemicals industry, the product is used to provide matte finishing, insulating and thickening properties for use in a variety of applications. 

Sales and Customers 

Sales of these products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. In our Specialty Carbons and Formulations business, sales are generally to a broad number of customers. In our Metal Oxides business, sales under long-term contracts with two customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the revenue. 

Competition 

We are a leading producer of the products we sell in this segment. We compete in the manufacture of carbon black primarily with two companies with a global presence and several other companies that have a regional presence, some of which export product outside their region. We compete with several companies that produce specialty compounds, primarily in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our inkjet colorants and inks are designed to replace traditional pigment dispersions and dyes used in inkjet printing applications. Competitive products for inkjet colorants are organic dyes and other dispersed pigments manufactured and marketed by large chemical companies and small independent producers. For fumed silica, we compete primarily with two companies with a global presence and several other companies which have a regional presence. For aerogel, we compete principally with one other company that produces aerogel products. We also compete with non-aerogel insulation products manufactured by regional companies throughout the world.

Competition for our products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation and price. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, operations excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage. 

Raw Materials 

Raw materials for our products are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of carbon black is a portion of the residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of carbon black. These raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of carbon black feedstock and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials, and related transportation costs. Importantly, movements in the market price for crude oil typically affect carbon black feedstock costs. The primary raw materials used for our specialty compounds include carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, thermoplastic resins and mineral fillers from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet colorants include carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, organic pigments and other treating agents available from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet inks include pigment dispersions, solvents and other additives.

Raw materials for the production of fumed silica are various chlorosilane feedstocks. We purchase feedstocks and for some customers convert their feedstock to product on a fee-basis (so called &#8220;toll conversion&#8221;). We also purchase aluminum chloride as feedstock for the production of fumed alumina. We have long-term procurement contracts or arrangements in place for the purchase of fumed silica feedstock, which we believe will enable us to meet our raw material requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we buy some raw materials in the spot market to help ensure flexibility and minimize costs. The principal raw materials for the production of aerogel are silica sol and/or sodium silicate.

Operations 

We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce specialty grades of carbon black primarily in China, The Netherlands and the United States. Our specialty compounds are produced in facilities that we own, or have a controlling interest in, located in Belgium, China and the United Arab Emirates. Our inkjet colorants and inks are manufactured at our facility in Haverhill, Massachusetts. We also own, or have a controlling interest in, manufacturing plants that produce fumed metal oxides in the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Germany and a manufacturing plant that produces aerogel in Frankfurt, Germany. An equity affiliate operates a fumed metal oxides plant in Mettur Dam, India.

During fiscal 2016, we announced our entry into an agreement with Inner Mongolia Hengyecheng Silicone Co., Ltd (&#8220;HYC&#8221;) to build a fumed silica manufacturing facility in Wuhai, China in which we will hold an 80% share and HYC will hold the remaining 20% share. The facility will have an initial annual manufacturing capacity of approximately 8,000 metric tons. We expect construction of the plant to begin in early calendar year 2017 and to be completed in calendar year 2019. 

Purification Solu tions 

Products 

Activated carbon is a porous material consisting mainly of elemental carbon treated with heat, steam and/or chemicals to create high internal porosity, resulting in a large internal surface area that resembles a sponge. It is generally produced in two forms, powdered and granular, and is manufactured in different sizes, shapes and levels of purity and using a variety of raw materials for a wide variety of applications. Activated carbon is used to remove contaminants from liquids and gases using a process called adsorption, whereby the interconnected pores of activated carbon trap contaminants. 

Our activated carbon products are used for the purification of water, air, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and other liquids and gases, as either a colorant or a decolorizing agent in the production of products for food and beverage applications and as a chemical carrier in slow release applications. In gas and air applications, one of the uses of activated carbon is for the removal of mercury in flue gas streams. In certain applications, used activated carbon can be reactivated for further use by removing the contaminants from the pores of the activated carbon product. The most common applications for our reactivated carbon are water treatment and food and beverage purification. In addition to our activated carbon production and reactivation, we also provide activated carbon solutions through on-site equipment and services, including delivery systems for activated carbon injection in coal-fired utilities, mobile water filter units and carbon reactivation services. 

Sales and Customers 

Sales of activated carbon are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, food and beverage processors, water treatment plants, pharmaceutical companies and catalyst producers. Some of our sales of activated carbon are made under annual contracts or longer-term agreements, particularly in mercury removal applications. 

Competition 

We are one of the leading manufacturers of activated carbon in the world. We compete in the manufacture of activated carbon with a number of companies, some of whom have a global presence and others who have a regional or local presence, although not all of these companies manufacture activated carbon for the range of applications for which we sell our products. 

Competition for activated carbon and activated carbon equipment and services is based on quality, price, performance, and supply-chain stability. We believe our product and application diversity, product differentiation, technological leadership, quality, cost-effective access to raw materials, and scalable manufacturing capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials we use in the manufacture of activated carbon are various forms of coal, including lignite, wood and other carbonaceous materials, which are, in general, readily available and we believe we have in adequate supply. We also own a lignite mine that is operated by Caddo Creek Resources Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company, which supplies our Marshall, Texas facility. 

Operations 

We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce activated carbon in the United States, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Italy. Our affiliates operate activated carbon plants in Canada and Mexico. The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2016 in activated carbon operations in which we own less than 100%:

Specialty Fluids 

Products 

Our Specialty Fluids segment principally produces and markets cesium formate as a drilling and completion fluid for use primarily in high pressure and high temperature oil and gas well construction. Cesium formate products are solids-free, high-density fluids that have a low viscosity, enabling safe and efficient well construction and workover operations. The fluid is resistant to high temperatures, minimizes damage to producing reservoirs and is readily biodegradable in accordance with the testing guidelines set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In a majority of applications, cesium formate is blended with other formates or products. We also manufacture and sell fine cesium chemicals that are used in a wide range of applications, including catalysts and brazing fluxes. 

Sales, Rental and Customers 

Sales of our cesium formate products are made to oil and gas operating companies directly by Cabot employees and sales representatives and indirectly through oil field service companies. We generally rent cesium formate to our customers for use in drilling operations on a short-term basis and on occasion make direct sales of cesium formate outside of the rental process. After completion of a job under our rental process, the customer returns the remaining fluid to Cabot and it is reprocessed for use in subsequent well operations. Any fluid that is lost during use and not returned to Cabot is paid for by the customer.

A large portion of our fluids has been used for drilling and completion of wells in the North Sea with a limited number of customers, where we have supplied cesium formate-based fluids for both reservoir drilling and completion activities on large gas and condensate field projects in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. We continue to expand the use of our fluids to drilling operations outside of the North Sea, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.

Competition 

Formate fluids compete mainly with traditional drilling fluid technologies. Competition in the well fluids business is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation, price, and proximity of inventory to customers&#8217; drilling operations. We believe our commercial strengths include our unique product offerings and their performance, and our customer service. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw material used in this business is pollucite (cesium ore), of which we own a substantial portion of the world&#8217;s known reserves. In November 2015, we completed a development project at our mine in Manitoba, Canada. We believe we have sufficient raw material to enable us to continue to supply cesium products for the foreseeable future, based on our anticipated consumption. We are not currently mining at the site and will assess options to access additional reserves in the mine, various technologies to augment our cesium supply and alternative sources of ore as demand for our cesium products warrants.

Most jobs for which cesium formate is used require a large volume of the product. Accordingly, the Specialty Fluids business maintains a large inventory of fluid. 

Operations 

Our mine and cesium formate manufacturing facility are located in Manitoba, Canada, and we have fluid blending and reclamation facilities in Aberdeen, Scotland and in Bergen, Norway. In addition, we warehouse fluid at various locations around the world to support existing and potential operations. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own and are a licensee of various patents, which expire at different times, covering many of our products as well as processes and product uses. Although the products made and sold under these patents and licenses are important to Cabot, the loss of any particular patent or license would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. We sell our products under a variety of trademarks we own and take reasonable measures to protect them. While our trademarks are important to Cabot, the loss of any one of our trademarks would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. 

Seasonality 

Our businesses are generally not seasonal in nature, although we may experience some regional seasonal declines during holiday periods and some weather-related seasonality in Purification Solutions. 

Backlog 

We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and is not a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 4,300 employees. Some of our employees in the United States and abroad are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally satisfactory. 

Research and Development 

Cabot develops new and improved products and higher efficiency processes through Company-sponsored research and technical service activities, including those initiated in response to customer requests. In fiscal 2016, we announced our plan to open a new Asia Technology Center in Shanghai, China to support our applications development and customer collaboration efforts in the region. We expect to open the facility in late calendar year 2017. Our expenditures for research and technical service activities generally are spread among our businesses and are shown in the consolidated statements of operations. Further discussion of our research and technical expenses incurred in each of our last three fiscal years appears in MD&#38;A in Item 7 below. 

Safety, Health and Environment (&#8220;SH&#38;E&#8221;) 

Cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the &#8220;Superfund law&#8221;) and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites primarily associated with our divested businesses. (See &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; below.) During the next several years, as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out, we expect to spend against our $14 million environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation. Adjustments are made to the reserve based on our continuing analysis of our share of costs likely to be incurred at each site. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates due to unknown conditions at the various sites, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and changing technologies for handling site investigation and remediation. While the reserve represents our best estimate of the costs we expect to incur, the actual costs to investigate and remediate these sites may exceed the amounts accrued in the environmental reserve. While it is always possible that an unusual event may occur with respect to a given site and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period, we do not believe that the costs relating to these sites, in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, it is possible that we may also incur future costs relating to environmental liabilities not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate. 

Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters (&#8220;SH&#38;E Requirements&#8221;). These SH&#38;E Requirements include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities and for product registrations. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable sums to construct, maintain, operate, and improve facilities for safety, health and environmental protection and to comply with SH&#38;E Requirements. We spent approximately $30 million in environmental-related capital expenditures at existing facilities in fiscal 2016. We anticipate spending approximately $48 million for such matters in fiscal 2017, a significant portion of which will be for the installation of technology controls for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at certain of our carbon black plants in North America.

In recognition of the importance of compliance with SH&#38;E Requirements to Cabot, our Board of Directors has a Safety, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors, meets four times a year and provides oversight and guidance to Cabot&#8217;s safety, health and environmental management programs. In particular, the Committee reviews Cabot&#8217;s environmental reserve, safety, health and environmental risk assessment and management processes, environmental and safety audit reports, performance metrics, performance as benchmarked against industry peer groups, assessed fines or penalties, site security and safety issues, health and environmental training initiatives, and the SH&#38;E budget. The Committee also consults with our external and internal advisors regarding management of Cabot&#8217;s safety, health and environmental programs. 

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (&#8220;IARC&#8221;) classifies carbon black as a Group 2B substance (known animal carcinogen, possible human carcinogen). We have communicated IARC&#8217;s classification of carbon black to our customers and employees and have included that information in our safety data sheets and elsewhere, as appropriate. We continue to believe that the available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that carbon black is not carcinogenic to humans, and does not present a health hazard when handled in accordance with good housekeeping and safe workplace practices as described in our safety data sheets. 

REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals), the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) regulatory framework for chemicals developed by the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;), applies to all chemical substances produced or imported into the EU in quantities greater than one metric ton a year. Manufacturers or importers of these chemical substances are required to submit specified health, safety, risk and use information about the substance to the European Chemical Agency. We have completed all required registrations under REACH to date and will continue to complete the registrations under REACH for our products in accordance with future registration deadlines. We will also continue to work with the manufacturers and importers of our raw materials, including our feedstocks, to ensure their registration prior to the applicable deadlines. In addition, the EC has adopted a harmonized definition of &#8220;nanomaterial&#8221; to be used in the EU to identify materials for which special provisions may apply, such as risk assessment and ingredient labeling. The EC definition is broad and applies to many of our existing products, including carbon black, fumed silica and fumed alumina. Country-specific product registration and assessment programs have been implemented in some countries and are being developed by others. We will continue to address these requirements.

Environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. I n addition, global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions impact the carbon black and activated carbon industries as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. The EU Emission Trading Scheme applies to our carbon black facilities and one activated carbon facility in Europe. In China, two of our carbon black facilities are participating in regional pilot emissions trading program s associated with the development of a national trading program , which we anticipate will be more fully defi ned in fiscal 2017. In Canada, our carbon black manufacturing facility will be subject to the greenhouse gas emissions trading program beginning in calendar year 2017. &#160; In the U.S., some of our facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions, but are not currently subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls. We generally expect to purchase emission credits where necessary to respond to allocation shortfalls. In addition, air emission regulations may be adopted in the f uture in other regions and countries where we operate , which could have an impact on our operations. 

A number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water conservation and wastewater recycling. The costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Various U.S. agencies and international bodies have adopted security requirements applicable to certain manufacturing and industrial facilities and marine port locations. These security-related requirements involve the preparation of security assessments and security plans in some cases, and in other cases the registration of certain facilities with specified governmental authorities. We closely monitor all security-related regulatory developments and believe we are in compliance with all existing requirements. Compliance with such requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 

A significant portion of our revenues and operating profits is derived from overseas operations. The profitability of our segments is affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. (See MD&#38;A and the Geographic Information portion of Note U for further information relating to sales and long-lived assets by geographic area.) Currency fluctuations, nationalization and expropriation of assets are risks inherent in international operations. We have taken steps we deem prudent in our international operations to diversify and otherwise to protect against these risks, including the use of foreign currency financial instruments to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of certain foreign currencies compared to the U.S. dollar. (See the risk management discussion contained in &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; in Item 7A below and Note L of the Notes to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements).
