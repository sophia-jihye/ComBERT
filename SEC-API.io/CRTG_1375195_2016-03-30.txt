Organizational History &#160; 

&#160;

3DIcon Corporation was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma as First Keating Corporation. Our articles of incorporation were amended August 1, 2003 to change the name to 3DIcon Corporation. The initial focus of First Keating Corporation was to market and distribute books written by its founder, Martin Keating. During 2001, First Keating Corporation began to focus on the development of 360-degree holographic technology. The effective date of this transition was January 1, 2001. We accounted for this transition as a reorganization and accordingly, restated its capital accounts as of January 1, 2001. At the inception on January 1, 2001, our primary activity was the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the formation and commercialization of interactive, optical holography for the communications and entertainment industries.

&#160;

In April 2004, we engaged the University of Oklahoma (the &#8220;University&#8221; or &#8220;OU&#8221;) to conduct a pilot study to determine the opportunity and feasibility for the creation of volumetric three dimensional display systems.

&#160;

On July 15, 2005, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (&#8220;SRA&#8221;) with the University, which expired on January 14, 2007. Under this agreement, the University conducted a research project entitled &#34;Investigation of 3-Dimensional Display Technologies&#34;.

&#160;

On February 23, 2007, we entered into an SRA with the University, which expired on March 31, 2010. Under this agreement, the University conducted a research project entitled &#34;3-Dimensional Display Development&#34;.

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2007 we announced the release of our first product, &#34;Pixel Precision&#34;. On

February 12, 2009, version 2.0 of Pixel Precision was released to expand capabilities and provide new compatibility with Texas Instrument's newly released DLP&#174; Discovery 4000 kits. This is a companion software application to the DMD Discovery line of products manufactured by Texas Instruments&#174;. Further development of this product was ended in 2015.

&#160;

In July 2013, the Company was awarded a two year grant from OCAST. This was the second $300,000 grant received from OCAST. The first grant was completed in August 2012. This matching grant was for a total of $300,000 and commenced September 1, 2013. The Company received $5,122 in funding during the year ended December 31, 2015. The funds were being used to support the development of the Company&#8217;s first Product Platform, which will be the basis for a family of products based on the Company&#8217;s CSpace&#174; volumetric 3D display technology.

&#160;

The grant was cancelled in March 2015 upon the resignation of Dr. Hakki Refai, the principal investigator under the grant.

&#160;

Overview of Business 

&#160;

3DIcon is a small public company that is further developing a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University under an SRA. The development to date has resulted in multiple new technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.

&#160;

&#160;

On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#34;USPTO&#34;) approved the patent called &#34;Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display&#34; for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to US patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the patent called &#8220;Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,&#8221; and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called &#8220;3D Volumetric Display&#8221; and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what we are calling our CSpace&#174; technology (&#8220;CSpace&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Volumetric 

&#160; 

The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through a combination of government funded research and development contracts, joint development agreements with industry partners and technology licensing agreements with companies like Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Siemens, and General Electric for high value applications in military planning, cyber data analysis, battlespace visualization, oil and gas exploration and medical imaging. Although we do not have any definitive agreements in place that provide for such funding, we believe that the Federal Government would be interested in entering into funded arrangements based on past and existing discussions our management have had with Federal Government Program Managers. Likewise, we believe that Industry would be interested in entering into joint development agreements that could ultimately lead to licensing agreements. For example, Raytheon, Boeing and Schott Defense have provided letters of support for government grants that we have applied for, indicating their interest in working with us on the specific project if the grant were to be awarded. We have no formal agreements or commitments from Boeing or Raytheon beyond these initial discussions. We have had similar interactions with a number of companies, such as Lockheed, Honeywell, General Electric, Florida Institute of Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), Cleveland Clinic, ShuffleMaster, etc. regarding our CSpace technology.

&#160;

The above commercialization plan depends on our ability to convince potential customers (Government and Industry) that products based on our technology will meet their requirements and that the technical risk in developing products based on our technology will be acceptable to these potential customers. We are targeting high value applications that typically require products to be customized to the customer&#8217;s application. Since we understand the capabilities and limitations of CSpace better than potential customers, it is not unusual for this type of customer to ask the technology developer (in this case 3DIcon) to do most or part of the product development for or with the customer in exchange for funding by the customer. In 2016, we plan to continued to solicit the Federal Government and Industry to enter into customer-funded development contracts to develop our technology for or with those customers. Our goal is to generate sufficient funding from such arrangements that would meet or exceed the incremental costs of developing product prototypes for or with customers. If we are successful in completing the initial product prototypes on a timely basis, it is possible that the Company could generate licensing revenues from our CSpace technology beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 &#160; . The Company believes that it has an experienced display industry and management team with a proven track record of successfully commercializing multiple display technologies to move our CSpace technology strategy forward.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In March of 2012, the Company implemented a new evolutionary, step-by-step commercialization strategy for the CSpace volumetric display technology. Under this strategy we are developing multiple staged prototypes with successively higher performance (brightness, resolution, and image size). Lab Proto 2 is a working prototype with significant improvements over Lab Proto 1 and was completed in October 2012. Our technical team increased the image size of Lab Proto 2 by a factor of eight (8x) and the brightness of the image by a factor of five (5x). Taken together with the 50 times higher brightness already achieved, Lab Proto 2 is 250 times (250x) brighter than Lab Proto 1. Because of the larger image size and the much higher brightness, we achieved much higher effective resolution as well. Lab Proto 3, while not complete, is already 80 times brighter than Lab Proto 2 and more than 2,000 times brighter than Lab Proto 1. Most of the engineering work (optics, electronics and software) is complete, and the focus is now on the image space materials. 

&#160;

The goals for Lab Proto 3 are to develop a lower cost and more scalable image chamber material (specialty glass), to enhance imagine brightness by ten (10x) by utilizing a new scanning system, and to use that new material to construct an even larger image chamber than was demonstrated for Lab Proto 2. Part of our Joint Development Agreement (&#8220;JDA&#8221;) with Schott Defense (&#8220;Schott&#8221;) and our efforts to secure federal funding are aimed at accelerating the process of securing a scalable material for CSpace&#8217;s image space. 

&#160;

Delays have been incurred in the efforts to seek the best possible solution to the material required for the image space. Our federal funding strategy and JDA with Schott are specifically targeted at securing this material, though they have failed to provide the necessary capital to date.

&#160;

We believe that Lab Proto 3 will enable the Company to credibly engage with potential customers and secure customer funded development contracts to develop even larger and higher resolution product prototypes. If we are successful in securing customer funded development contracts, we anticipate the development of various product prototypes, the first of which we have been calling the Trade Show Prototype. It is likely that in exchange for funding of the TradeShow Prototype, our initial customer will require an exclusive license to the technology in a particular field of use (e.g. medical imaging). The Company believes that any such exclusive license will be based on a set period of time during product and/or market development and based on performance thereafter. Failure by the customer to meet agreed upon performance criteria would most likely result in the license becoming non-exclusive. Any such exclusive license agreement would preclude the Company from working with other customers in that field of use during the period of the exclusive license. The Company does not believe that this strategy for funding the Tradeshow Prototype will significantly impact the revenue potential of the technology given the number of potential applications (fields of use). If successfully developed, the Trade Show Prototype, which is illustrated as an artist concept in Figure 3 below, will be fully packaged and portable so that it can be used for trade shows and on-site customer demonstrations. We believe that the Trade Show Prototype will enable the Company to market and secure licensing agreements with large government contractors and large medical or industrial products companies.

Federal Funding Strategy 

&#160;

As funding has increased for the 3D field, the Company has implemented a federal funding strategy to augment its other capital raising efforts. In December 2013, the Company secured the services of Doug Freitag, an expert in identifying and obtaining government grants of the type we are seeking. The initial targets for this strategy included: the Obama Administration&#8217;s multi-agency priorities of advanced manufacturing and information technology (e.g., Big Data Research and Development Initiative with over $200 million annually); the Department of Defense&#8217;s priorities to reduce the cost of developing, testing, and manufacturing new weapon systems, enhance training and operation of autonomous systems and accelerate data-to-decisions; and Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s on-going priority to enhance air traffic control systems. As a result of feedback from various Federal Government Program Managers, the strategy has changed and now places increased emphasis on a growing need for new technologies to visualize cyber data, military planning, medical imaging data, data collected when screening for contraband and validation of 3D engineering designs prior to manufacturing by 3D printing. The strategy also places greater emphasis on Small Business Innovation Research Grants where funding continues to grow, competition is limited to other small businesses, 3DIcon can more easily be the project leader, and the cycle for awards from the date of submission can be much faster. Larger contracts will still be considered but include other partners and may require one of more partners to lead the projects if awarded. A pre-proposal titled &#8220;Glasses-Free 3D Volumetric Display for to Enhance Mission Analysis&#8221; was submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency on November 26, 2014. A proposal titled &#8220;3D Volumetric Display of Neurological Data Provided by MRI Imaging&#8221; was submitted to the National institute of Health on December 5, 2014 and is under review. A proposal titled &#8220;Transforming Cyber Data into Human-Centered 3D Visualizations&#8221; was submitted to the Air Force on February 25, 2015. A pre-proposal titled &#8220;Glasses-Free 3D Volumetric Visualization of Critical Data to Enhance Decision Making&#8221; was submitted to the DOD Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office on March 20, 2015. These submissions, have failed to produce funding necessary to accelerate the development process, though the Company will continue to pursue federal funding on a selective basis &#160; .

&#160;

Joint Development Agreement with Schott Defense 

&#160;

As part of our federal funding strategy we intend to effectively compete by forming interdisciplinary teams with potential strategic partners (large and small), academic and commercial laboratories, and systems integrators providing integrated data visualization solutions. The first of these partnerships was reached in March 2014 when the Company signed a JDA with Schott, a federally focused subsidiary of Schott North America. Schott is a world-class multi-billion dollar company with significant experience and success in partnering with federal agencies for development projects. In addition, Schott is one of the world&#8217;s leaders in developing specialty glass for many applications, including display technology. This partnership, coupled with the expertise of Doug Freitag, should facilitate the Company&#8217;s federal funding strategy and our ability to create the unique materials required to advance the CSpace technology. In December of 2015 Schott AG closed the development office, Schott Defense, in Washington, D.C. It is unclear how this may impact the JDA going forward.

&#160;

Commercialization Strategy &#38; Target Applications 

&#160;

The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer funded research and development contracts and technology licensing agreements with companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Siemens, and General Electric for high value applications like air traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high value / low volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following: 

&#160;

&#167; Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, biosurveillance); &#167; Cyber Security Data Visualization; &#167; Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting); &#167; Physical Security (passenger, luggage &#38; cargo screening); &#167; Mining, Oil &#38; Gas Exploration; or &#167; Meteorological and Oceanographic data visualization. &#160;

In order to simplify internal development efforts on CSpace, software to control the initial laboratory prototype was created and later productized as &#34;Pixel Precision&#34; in 2007.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Based on our market research and competitive analysis to date, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360 degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360 degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. While rotating displays (also called swept volume) such as Perspecta from Optics For Hire (formerly Actuality, now licensed), Xigen (research only), Ray Modeler from Sony (research only), Felix 3D (research only), and the USC light field display (research only) do provide a true 360 degree viewing experience, they cannot deliver a large image, high image quality and reliability because the entire display is rotating at high speed. Early proof of concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360 degree viewing experience and cost effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.

&#160;

Flat Screen 3D Strategy 

&#160; 

Since March of 2012, the Company has been evaluating a number of second-generation, glasses-free flat screen 3D display technologies and the companies that are developing these technologies with the possibility of an acquisition of such a company in mind. Our goal was to identify a new technology that could deliver significantly better performance (3D impact and image quality) than current large area multiple-viewer glasses-free 3D flat screen displays without compromising resolution and brightness, as do current displays. The ideal company would also have a great technical team, a broad patent portfolio, and a credible technology roadmap to ensure that these competitive advantages are sustainable into the future. As a result of the above evaluation process, the Company previously entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire Dimension Technologies, Inc. (DTI) www.dti3d.com located in Rochester, NY. However, that Letter of Intent has since expired. Notwithstanding the expiration of the Letter of Intent, the Company&#8217;s interest in a potential acquisition of a small 3D flat screen display company remains. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully raise adequate funds for such a transaction in the future.

&#160;

Currently, we do not have any agreements in place that would allow entry into the flat screen segment of the glasses-free 3D display industry or digital signage industry and no assurances can be made that such an agreement will ever be consummated. The Company is not actively seeking such acquisitions in the glasses-free 3D flat screen display segment at this time.

&#160;

History of 3D Technology Research and Development at the University of Oklahoma 

&#160;

Beginning in 2007 the University, under an SRA with 3DIcon, undertook the development of the following three high potential 3D display technologies. The results of each project are summarized below.

&#160;

&#167; I - Swept Volume Displays - We have successfully achieved the initial demonstration and proof of technology for this approach. &#167; II - Static Volumetric Displays - This technology was ranked by the University as the best for further development. &#167; III - Stacked Volume Displays - We also have investigated the technologies for developing innovative Stacked Volumetric Displays. &#160;

The Swept Volume Display is designed to be a 3D display system showing a volumetric image generated from an electronic medium. A proof-of-concept demonstration was achieved by the researchers around September 2007. The Swept Volume Display R&#38;D entered into the subsequent second stage of improvement and development in 2008. Additional work on this particular approach has been deferred indefinitely because of the success and initial superiority of the CSpace technology.

&#160;

Our implementation of a Static Volume Display (CSpace&#174;) employs one or more Digital Micro-Mirror Devices (DMDs) and infra-red lasers to produce 3D images in advanced transparent nanotechnology materials, thereby enabling the creation, transmission and display of high resolution 3D images within a volume space, surrounded by glass or transparent screen. The initial investigation for the Static Volume system commenced in 2007. In September 2008, we built a laboratory prototype Static Volume Display using the CSpace technology and demonstrated the creation of true 3D images within a specified image space. New developments for eliminating the distortion occurred by the divergence of the constructed 3D image were presented at the SPIE Europe Security &#38; Defense conference in Berlin, Germany in August 2009. Improvements for the optical systems utilized by CSpace with the latest achieved resolution were published in October 2009 in IEEE/OSA Journal of Display Technology titled &#34;Static Volumetric Three-Dimensional Display&#34; and can be found for a moderate fee at http://www.opticsinfobase.org . On February 15, 2010, at the SPIE Medical Imaging conference, we presented the latest software developments that allow reading Digital Imaging and Communication In Medicine (&#34;DICOM&#34;) formats whether scanned by ultrasound devices, magnetic resonance imaging (&#34;MRI&#34;), or computed tomography (&#34;CT&#34;) scanners. With this new software architecture, Static Volume 3D displays based on the CSpace technology would have the capability of displaying medical images.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On April 14, 2010, at the OSA Digital Holography and Three-Dimensional Imaging conference in Miami, FL, we presented an increase in brightness of the constructed 3D images. On September 23, 2010, at the SPIE Europe Security &#38; Defense conference in Toulouse, France, we presented new implementations to reduce flicker of the 3D Images constructed by CSpace display. In November 2010, we published a new method of rendering 3D Images using a rotational-slicing technique at the Journal of the Society for Information Display and can be found for a moderate fee at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1889/JSID18.11.873/abstract . In December 2010, we published the utilization of new materials for CSpace image space at the Journal of the Society for Information Display and can be found for a moderate fee at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1889/JSID18.12.1065/abstract . In April 2011, New Developments That Allow CSpace To Perfectly Fit Applications Such As Air Traffic Control was published in the IEEE/OSA Journal of Display Technology and can be found for a moderate fee at http://www.opticsinfobase.org/jdt/abstract.cfm?uri=jdt-7-4-186 . On April 25, 2011, we presented a new paper called &#8220;Multi-layer overlay display,&#8221; at the SPIE Defense &#38; Security Conference in Orlando, FL. On May 17, 2013, we presented a new paper called &#8221;CSpace High-Resolution Volumetric 3D Display,&#8221; at the SPIE Defense &#38; Security in Baltimore, Maryland. On September 26, 2014 we were interviewed for an article on medical imaging by Medical Device Daily and can be found at http://www.medicaldevicedaily.com/servlet/com.accumedia.web.Dispatcher?next=mdd_currentIssue&#38;issueId=23719&#38;prodID=4&#38;month=09&#38;year=2014 . On December 18, 2014, we co-authored a new publication called &#8220;Scalable Upconversion Medium for Static Volumetric Display&#8221; in the Journal of Display Technology and can be found for a moderate fee at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&#38;arnumber=6987226 . On March 1, 2015 we published an overview on the applications for 3D Volumetric Displays in NASA Tech Briefs and can be found at http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/27-ntb/features/application-briefs/21710 . On February 27, 2015 we were interviewed for a Q/A article on 3D imaging by Medical Design Technology that can be found at http://www.mdtmag.com/blogs/2015/02/true-3d-imagesglasses-free . On March 24, 2015 we made a presentation called &#8220;Glasses-Free 3D Volumetric Display for Enhanced Decision Making&#8221; at the 2015 National Defense Industry Association Science &#38; Engineering Technology Division Conference.

&#160;

Regarding our continued efforts to improve the performance of the CSpace technology, we completed our second-generation prototype (Lab Proto 2) in October 2012. Our goals for Lab Proto 2 were to first improve image brightness, and then to improve resolution (increase the number of voxels or 3D pixels), and lastly to increase the size of the image. The image generated by Lab Proto 2 is approximately 250 times (250x) brighter than our first generation prototype and can now be viewed in normal room lighting. As a result of the increased brightness, resolution has also been improved. The estimated resolution of the second-generation prototype is approximately five times (5x) greater than the first generation prototype. The image size of Lab Proto 2 is approximately 8 times (8x) larger than our first generation prototype. We continue to develop a third-generation prototype (Lab Proto 3) with a larger image space, which we believe will enable the Company to credibly engage with potential customers and secure customer funded development contracts to develop even larger and higher resolution product prototypes, eventually leading to a trade show prototype that will be portable and package for display at trade shows or on-site customer demonstrations.

&#160;

University of Oklahoma - Sponsored Research Agreement History 

&#160;

On December 1, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement (the &#34;Agreement&#34;) with the University pursuant to which the University agreed to convert all sums due to it from the Company in connection with its SRA with the Company, which as of December 1, 2010 amounted to approximately $485,000, into an aggregate of 1,685,714 shares of the Company's common stock (the &#34;Shares&#34;). As a result of the debt conversion, the University became the holder of approximately 8% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Shares were subject to a put option allowing the University to require the Company to purchase certain of the Shares upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the Shares were subject to a call option allowing the Company to require the University to sell to the Company the Shares then held by the University in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The put options and the call options expired on November 30, 2014 and the Shares are no longer subject to such options.

&#160;

The Agreement also amended the existing agreements between the Company and the University such that all intellectual property, including all inventions and or discoveries, patentable or un-patentable, developed before July 28, 2008 by the University under the SRA is owned by the University. All intellectual property, including all inventions and/or discoveries, patentable or un-patentable, developed jointly by the Company and the University at any time is jointly owned by the Company and the University. Finally, all intellectual property developed by the Company after July 28, 2008, including all inventions and or discoveries, patentable or un-patentable, is owned by the Company.
