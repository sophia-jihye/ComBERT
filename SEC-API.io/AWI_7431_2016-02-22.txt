 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (&#147;AWI&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891. When we refer to &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries. 

We are a leading global producer of flooring products and ceiling systems for use primarily in the construction and renovation of residential, commercial and institutional buildings. We design, manufacture and sell flooring products (primarily resilient and wood) and ceiling systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass and metal) around the world. 

On February 23, 2015, we announced that our board of directors unanimously approved a plan to separate our Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments from our Building Products (Ceilings) segment. The separation will be effected by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (&#147;AFI&#148;) and then distributing the common stock of AFI to AWI&#146;s shareholders. The separation and distribution will result in AWI and AFI becoming two independent, publicly-traded companies, with AFI owning and operating the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments and AWI continuing to own and operate the Building Products (Ceilings) segment. In 2015, we recorded $34.3 million of separation costs, primarily related to outside professional services and employee compensation and severance accruals. We expect the effective date of the separation to be near the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

In October 2006, the Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust (&#147;Asbestos PI Trust&#148;) was created to address AWI&#146;s personal injury (including wrongful death) asbestos-related liability and received a distribution of 37,000,000 shares of our common stock. All present and future asbestos-related personal injury claims against AWI, including contribution claims of co-defendants but excluding certain foreign claims against subsidiaries, arising directly or indirectly out of AWI&#146;s pre-filing use of, or other activities involving, asbestos are channeled to the Asbestos PI Trust. 

From the fourth quarter of 2012 through the fourth quarter of 2014, the Asbestos PI Trust sold 20,448,362 shares of our common stock. In 2015, the Asbestos Trust sold 4,281,884 shares of our common stock. We did not sell any shares and did not receive any proceeds from these transactions. As a result of these transactions, the Asbestos PI Trust currently holds approximately 9% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015.

Reportable Segments 

We operate four business segments - Building Products, Resilient Flooring, Wood Flooring and Unallocated Corporate. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information on our reportable segments. 

Markets 

We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate - often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The major markets in which we compete are: 

North American Residential. Our Building Products, Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments sell products for use in single and multi-family housing. Our ceiling products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall. Homeowners, builders, and property management firms can choose from our innovative resilient and wood flooring products, for which we are North America&#146;s largest provider, or from our laminate flooring products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. Our flooring products also compete with carpet, stone and ceramic products, which we do not offer. 

Our products are used in new home construction and existing home renovation work. We estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement / remodel) work represents the majority of the total North American residential market opportunity. Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence. We believe there is some longer-term correlation between 

&#160;

these statistics and our revenue after reflecting a lag period of several months between a change in construction activity and our operating results. However, we believe that consumers&#146; preferences for product type, style, color, availability, affordability and ease of installation also significantly affect our revenue. Further, changes in inventory levels and/or product focus at national home centers and independent building materials distributors can significantly affect our revenue. 

North American Commercial. Many of our products, primarily ceilings and resilient flooring, are used in commercial and institutional buildings. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Renovation work is estimated to represent the majority of the total North American commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from four major segments of commercial building &#150; office, education, retail and healthcare. We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 18 to 24 months. We also monitor office vacancy rates, gross domestic product (&#147;GDP&#148;) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. However, we believe that consumers&#146; preferences for product type, style, color, availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue. 

Outside of North America. About 20% of our 2015 consolidated sales were in Europe and the Pacific Rim and almost all were commercial in nature. For the countries in which we have significant revenue, we monitor various national statistics (such as GDP) as well as construction data (starts and project-related information). Revenues come primarily from new construction and renovation work. 

The following table provides an estimate of our segments&#146; 2015 net sales, by major markets.

Geographic Areas 

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional financial information by geographic areas. 

Customers 

We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We principally sell products through independent building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to retailers, builders, contractors, installers and others. In the commercial sector, we also sell to several contractors and to subcontractors&#146; alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. In the North American retail channel, which sells to end-users in the residential and light commercial segments, we have important relationships with national home centers such as The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe&#146;s Companies, Inc. In the North American residential sector, we have important relationships with major home builders and retail buying groups. Additionally, when market conditions and available capacity warrant, we also provide resilient and wood flooring products on an original equipment manufacturer (&#147;OEM&#148;) basis to other flooring companies. 

&#160;

Approximately two-thirds of our consolidated net sales are to distributors. Sales to large home centers account for approximately 15% of our consolidated sales. Our remaining sales are to contractors and retailers. 

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales during the last three years. 

Working Capital 

We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers. Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements. We sell the vast majority of our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future. These practices are typical within the industry. Our wood flooring business generally purchases green lumber which is held in inventory during the drying process for approximately three months. 

Competition 

We face strong competition in all of our businesses. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition in North America comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions. Our ceiling products compete with drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum) and our resilient, laminate and wood flooring products compete with carpet, stone and ceramic products. There is excess industry capacity for certain products in some geographies, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies are our primary competitors: 

Building Products &#150; CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by Rockwool International), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Knauf AMF GmbH &#38; Co. KG, Lafarge SA, Odenwald Faserplattenwerk GmbH, Rockfon A/S (owned by Rockwool International), Saint-Gobain and USG Corporation. 

Flooring segments &#150; Beaulieu International Group, N.V., Boa-Franc, Inc., Congoleum Corporation, Forbo Holding AG, Gerflor Group, IVC Group, Krono Holding AG, Lauzon Ltd, LG Floors, Mannington Mills, Inc., Mercier Wood Flooring, Inc., Metroflor Corporation, Mirage Hardwood Floors (a division of Boa-Franc Inc.), Mohawk Industries, Inc., Mullican Flooring, L.P., Nora Systems GmbH, Pfleiderer AG, Shaw Industries, Inc., Somerset Hardwood Flooring, Tarkett AG and USFloors, Inc. 

Raw Materials 

We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials used in each business include the following: 

&#160;

Business

&#160; Principal Raw Materials

Building Products &#160; Mineral fiber, fiberglass, perlite, waste paper, pigments, clays, starches and steel, which is used in the production of metal ceilings and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid Resilient Flooring &#160; Polyvinylchloride (&#147;PVC&#148;) resins and films, plasticizers, fiberglass and felt backings, limestone, pigments, inks and stabilizers Wood Flooring &#160; Hardwood lumber, veneer, coatings and stains We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water. 

In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our businesses. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us. 

&#160;

Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs. Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers. 

Sourced Products 

Some of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include various flooring products (laminate, wood, vinyl sheet, and luxury vinyl tile &#147;LVT&#148; products), specialty ceiling products and installation-related products, as well as accessories for some of our manufactured products. We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from the Pacific Rim and Europe. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenue in each of 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products. However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate. 

Seasonality 

Generally, our sales in North America and Europe tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles, the timing of renovation, home sales and new construction. We see similar patterns with respect to our sales in the Pacific Rim, though the timing of the Chinese New Year can affect buying behaviors. 

Patent and Intellectual Property Rights 

Patent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by U.S. and foreign patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes. 

Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets. 

Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation, , Armstrong &#174; , Alterna &#174; , American Scrape &#174; , BBT &#174; , BioBased Tile &#174; , BioGuard&#153;, Bruce &#174; , Cirrus &#174; , Cortega &#174; , Diamond 10&#153;, Dundee &#174; , Dune&#153;, Excelon &#174; , Huiyi&#153;, Humiguard &#174; , Imperial &#174; , Initiator&#153;, Inspiring Great Spaces &#174; , Laurel&#153;, Lock &#38; Fold &#174; , Luxe Plank &#174; , Manchester &#174; , Medintech &#174; , Memories&#153;, MetalWorks&#153;, Natural Creations &#174; , Optima &#174; , Perla&#153;, Plano &#174; , Stonetex &#174; , Station Square&#153;, StrataMax &#174; , Timberline &#174; , ToughGuard &#174; , Ultima &#174; , Vivero&#153;, and WoodWorks &#174; , are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the mark is used, and continues in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms. 

We review the carrying value of trademarks annually for potential impairment. See the &#147;Critical Accounting Estimates&#148; section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 7,600 full-time and part-time employees worldwide. Approximately 53% of our 3,500 production and maintenance employees in the U.S. are represented by labor unions. Outside the U.S., most of our production employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or state-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 

&#160;

Research &#38; Development 

Research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products&#146; competitiveness. Principal R&#38;D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes. We spent $31.1 million in 2015, $30.6 million in 2014 and $29.3 million in 2013 on R&#38;D activities worldwide. 

Sustainability and Environmental Matters 

The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability. 

We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. We are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations. 

Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 

Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;), and state or international Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing several domestically- and internationally owned, formerly owned and non-owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. In a few cases, we are one of several potentially responsible parties (&#147;PRPs&#148;) and have agreed to jointly fund the required investigation and remediation, while preserving our defenses to the liability. 

We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies. Most of our manufacturing and certain of our research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. 

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. For example, we are currently a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace; or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants. In some cases, these allegations involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe these claims and allegations to be without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 

We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations. Liabilities of $6.0 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, were recorded for potential environmental liabilities, on a global basis, that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
