 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne (Bio-Techne, we, our, us or the Company) develop, manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents and instruments for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, Bio-Techne is a leader in providing specialized proteins, including cytokines and growth factors, antibodies, related immunoassays, biologically active small molecules and other reagents, as well as instrumentation designed to simplify key protein analysis processes. Additionally we also serve the clinical markets with regulated products such as controls, calibrators, reagents and immunoassays intended for diagnostic uses. 

&#160; 

A Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company, Bio-Techne originally was founded as Research and Diagnostic Systems, Inc. (R&#38;D Systems) in 1976. Techne Corporation, a public entity at the time, acquired R&#38;D Systems in 1985 and through this action R&#38;D Systems became a public company. The initial products focused on the hematology blood controls and calibrators market but soon expanded through the creation of the Biotechnology segment to include reagents used in life science research, driven by a series of acquisitions beginning with the Amgen Inc. research business in 1991. From fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016, we have added seven new businesses and product portfolios and formed a third segment -- Protein Platforms. We also strengthened our Clinical Controls segment solutions by acquiring Bionostics Holdings Limited (Bionostics) and also expanded our Biotechnology segment product offerings through the acquisition of Shanghai-based PrimeGene Bio-Tech Co. (PrimeGene) in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, we acquired Novus Biologicals LLC (Novus Biologicals) to expand our antibody business which was made part of our Biotechnology segment. Also in fiscal 2015, we acquired ProteinSimple and CyVek, Inc. (CyVek), both with innovative instrument platforms useful for protein analysis, and which together form our new Protein Platforms segment. Early in fiscal 2016, we acquired Cliniqa Corporation (Cliniqa) (July 2015), which specializes in the manufacturing and commercialization of blood chemistry quality controls and calibrators as well as bulk reagents used for the clinical diagnostic market to further expand and complement our Clinical Controls solutions. Zephyrus BioSciences, Inc. (Zephyrus) (March 2016) was also acquired with a product line that enables western blotting on single cells and is now part of our Protein Platforms segment. 

&#160;

Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2016, we acquired our Italian distributor, Space Import-Export Srl (Space) (July 2016) and Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD) (August 2016). Space is a long and trusted business partner of Bio-Techne, distributing its products since 1985 and creating a very effective and visible presence in the Italian market space. ACD develops and commercializes proprietary consumables for genomic analysis, reinventing the widely used in-situ hybridization technique. 

&#160; &#160; 

Recognizing the importance of a unified and global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies, we have unified our brands and recent acquisitions under a single global brand, Bio-Techne. In November 2014 we changed the name of the parent corporation from Techne Corporation to Bio-Techne Corporation. The Bio-Techne name solidifies the new strategic direction for the Company, and also unifies all of our brands under one complete portfolio. 

&#160; 

We operate globally, with offices in multiple locations in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Today, our product line extends to over 300,000 products in state of the art facilities to accommodate many of our manufacturing needs.

&#160;

OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKETS 

&#160; 

Currently Bio-Techne operates worldwide and has three reportable business segments: Biotechnology, Clinical Controls and Protein Platforms. The Biotechnology reporting segment develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products world-wide. The Clinical Controls reporting segment develops and manufactures controls, calibrators, immunoassays and other reagents for the global clinical market. The Protein Platforms reporting segment develops and commercializes proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis. In fiscal 2016, net sales from Bio-Techne&#8217;s Biotechnology, Clinical Controls and Protein Platforms segments represented 64%, 21%, and 15% of consolidated net sales, respectively. Financial information relating to Bio-Techne&#8217;s segments is incorporated herein by reference to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Biotechnology Segment 

&#160; 

Through our Biotechnology segment, we are one of the world&#8217;s leading suppliers of specialized proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors, immunoassays, antibodies and related reagents, to the biotechnology research community. Our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Biotechnology Segment Products 

&#160; 

Proteins. We develop and manufacture in-house a range of cytokines, growth factors and enzymes, extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant DNA technology. We produce and characterize all protein products to a high degree of purity and biological activity. The growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that tiny amounts of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues. Cytokines are intercellular messengers and, as a result, act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell behavior. Enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Most enzymes, including proteases, kinases and phosphatases, are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins and in turn affect cell behavior and function. Additionally, both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s, arthritis, autoimmunity, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, inflammation, AIDS and influenza. 

&#160; 

Antibodies. Antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules. We produce our polyclonal antibodies in animals (primarily goats, sheep and rabbits), purifying them from the animals&#8217; blood. We derive monoclonal antibodies from immortalized rodent cell lines using hybridoma technology, isolating them from cell culture medium, or we manufacture them through recombinant DNA technology. The flow cytometry product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits that are used to determine the immuno-phenotypic properties of cells from different tissues. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Immunoassays. We market a variety of immunoassays on different testing platforms, including microtiter-plate based kits sold under the trade name Quantikine&#174;, multiplex immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and immunoassays based on planar spotted surfaces and microfluidic-based multiplex immunoassays on our automated testing platform. Researchers use these immunoassay products to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids, such as serum, plasma, or urine. Protein quantification is an integral component of basic research, as potential diagnostic tools for various diseases and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the drug discovery process. Immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics. We have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marketing clearance for erythropoietin (EPO), transferrin receptor (TfR) and Beta2-microglobulin (b2M) immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices. 

&#160; 

Small Molecule Chemically-based Products. These products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists, antagonists and/or inhibitors of various biological functions. Used in concert with other Company products, they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process. 

&#160; 

Biotechnology Segment Customers and Distribution Methods 

&#160; 

We sell our biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in North America, western Europe and China. We have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with Fisher Scientific in order to bolster our market presence in North America and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large Fisher organization. We also sell through third party distributors in China, Japan, southern and eastern Europe and the rest of the world. Our sales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of Biotechnology&#8217;s net sales during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. 

&#160; 

Biotechnology Segment Competitors 

&#160; 

A number of companies supply the worldwide market for protein-related and chemically-based research reagents, including GE Healthcare Life Sciences, BD Biosciences, Merck KGaA/EMD Chemicals, Inc., PeproTech, Inc., Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Abcam plc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Cayman Chemical Company and Enzo Biochem, Inc. Market success is primarily dependent upon product quality, selection and reputation. We believe we are one of the leading world-wide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research market. We further believe that the expanding line of our products, their recognized quality, and the growing demand for protein-related and chemically-based research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market. 

&#160; 

Biotechnology Segment Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We develop and manufacture the majority of our cytokines using recombinant DNA technology, thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources. Tocris chemical-based products are synthesized from widely available products. We typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products. 

&#160; 

The majority of our Biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers&#8217; orders. Consequently, we had no significant backlog of orders for our Biotechnology segment products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Clinical Controls Segment 

&#160; 

Our original business in this segment was focused on controls and calibrators for hematology clinical instruments. With the acquisition of Bionostics in fiscal 2014 and Cliniqa in fiscal 2016, we expanded this segment to include blood chemistry and blood gases quality controls diagnostic immunoassays as well as other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market. Our BiosPacific brand product revenues are also now included in this segment as of fiscal 2016, and have been reclassified in prior years for comparative purposes. 

&#160; 

Clinical Controls Segment Products 

&#160; 

Controls and Calibrators. Proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient&#8217;s blood cells, which is usually done with automated or semi-automated hematology instruments. We derive our hematology controls and calibrators from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized. These control and calibrator products ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of our competitors. We also offer clinical controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices, as well as coagulation device control products. 

&#160; 

Bulk Reagents for Diagnostic Use. We also develop and supply bulk purified proteins, enzymes, disease-state plasmas, infectious disease antigens and processed serums to the clinical diagnostic industry worldwide. Often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis to optimize their use in a customer&#8217;s diagnostic assay. We supply these reagents in various formats including liquid, lyophilized and powder form. 

&#160; 

Clinical Controls Segment Customers and Distribution Methods 

&#160; 

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreements represent the largest market for our clinical controls products. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, OEM agreements accounted for $54.2 million, $41.1 million, and $41.2 million, respectively, or 8%, 9%, and 12% of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2016 was the result of the acquisition of Cliniqa. We sell our clinical control products directly to customers and, in Europe and Asia, also through distributors. One OEM customer accounted for approximately 13%, and 14% of Clinical Controls&#8217; net sales during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively. This customer did not amount to 10% or more of the Company&#39;s consolidated revenue during these years.

&#160; 

Clinical Controls Segment Competitors 

&#160; 

Competition is intense in the clinical controls business. The market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents, chemicals and coagulation products and independent blood control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers. The principal clinical control competitors for our products in this segment are Abbott Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Streck, Inc., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. and Sysmex Corporation. We believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind Beckman Coulter, Inc. and Streck, Inc. We compete based primarily on product performance, quality, and price. SeraCare, HyTest Ltd and Thermo Fisher Scientific represent additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets. 

&#160; 

Clinical Controls Segment Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood. We purchase human blood from commercial blood banks, and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants. After we receive raw blood, we separate it into its cellular components, and then process and stabilize it. Although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use, the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business. Bio-Techne does not perform its own pathogen testing, as most suppliers test all human blood collected. Other controls are derived from various bodily fluids collected which are then processed in house to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products. 

&#160; 

The majority of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset, recurring schedule. For the remainder of our Clinical Controls products, the shipments are determined by our customers&#8217; needs, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. There was no significant backlog of orders for our Clinical Control products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Protein Platforms Segment 

&#160; 

Proteins are important for understanding disease because they are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell. Altered levels of certain proteins can prevent the cell from performing its intended function, produce the energy it requires, maintain its morphology or survive within the tissue. However, proteins analysis is complex given the varied and unique three dimensional structure of the many proteins of interest. Our Protein Platforms segment develops, manufactures and sells tools to simplify protein analysis while at the same time achieving more quantitative and reproducible results. 

&#160; 

Protein Platforms Segment Products 

&#160; 

The Simple Western Platform. The Western blot, or Western, is one of the most widely-used assays for protein analysis and identification today. Unchanged since its invention in 1979, the Western assay is used by molecular biologists, biochemists and clinicians to determine if a specific protein is present in a sample. The Western blot is able to report a protein&#8217;s molecular weight as well as its identity via an antibody mediated reaction. Our Simple Western platform is a fully-automated Western blot analytical technique that can identify and quantify a protein of interest in a sample. The Simple Western product lines simplify the workflow, transforming the Western into a real protein analytical tool by providing truly quantitative and high quality data. Our Simple Western products are more sensitive than a traditional Western and in conjunction with the lower sample volume requirements and the ability to run multiple proteins simultaneously this technology offers many competitive advantages. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

SimplePlex Platform. A common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The SimplePlex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology which integrates an innovatively designed microfluidic cartridge with a state-of-the-art analyzer to deliver a bench-top immunoassay system that is more sensitive than ELISA with none of the traditional challenges of assay design or repeatability. SimplePlex assays are fully automated, multi-analyte immunoassays that permit the customer to run multiple samples while interrogating multiple analytes in approximately one hour while leveraging the large biological content menu that has been developed over 30 years. We believe the SimplePlex technology, along with other immunoassay platforms offered by Bio-Techne, represents the most comprehensive line of immunoassay products to meet customers&#8217; complete workflow in their research and clinical protein applications. 

&#160; 

Biologics Instrumentation. 

&#160; 

Biologics are complex protein-based therapeutics, and are transforming the pharmaceutical industry and treatment of many diseases. Biologic drugs are very effective targeted therapeutics for diseases such as arthritis, cancer and diabetes, and their number in development is increasing because of a variety of advances in biochemistry, immunology and biotechnology. Biologics can be monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines. Developers of biologics are required by regulatory agencies, such as FDA, to develop robust processes to ensure that the specific biologic of interest can be identified and characterized accurately and then consistently and reliably produced. As a result, a suite of complementary analytical approaches are utilized to measure attributes such as identity, biological potency, purity, safety and impurities. These analytical approaches are used throughout the product development process, spanning initial discovery, expression, formulation, process development, quality control and final release. Our Biologics tools help researchers interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics. Our iCE3 system is an analytical tool that measures the charge heterogeneity of proteins. Our micro-flow imaging, or MFI, platform measures the size, shape, count and concentration of particles within the 1 &#181;m to 300 &#181;m size range that may be present in biologic solutions. In fiscal 2016, we launched a new biologics product, Maurice, which profiles identity, purity, and hetergenity of biopharmaceuticals in one system. 

&#160; 

Single Cell Western Platform. With the acquisition of Zephyrus Biosciences in March 2016, we now sell an instrument and related reagents to perform western blot assays on individual cells versus an entire cell population. We believe that the Zephyrus technology is a tool to elucidate the properties of individual cells to better understand cell behavior that can shape the overall cell population response in a disease or normal state. 

&#160; 

Protein Platforms Segment Customers and Distribution Methods. 

&#160; 

We sell our protein platforms products directly to customers who are primarily located in North America, western Europe and Japan. We also sell through third party distributors in China, southern Europe and the rest of the world. Our sales are widely distributed, and no single end-user customer accounted for more than 10% of Protein Platforms&#8217; net sales during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. 

&#160; 

Protein Platforms Segment Competitors. 

&#160; 

Our Simple Western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional Western blot. As a result, we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional Western blot users. These competitors include Bio-Rad Laboratories, GE Healthcare, Merck KGaA, PerkinElmer and Thermo Fisher Scientific. All of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow. Similarly, our SimplePlex platform replaces the traditional ELISA assay as well as some flow-based multiplex assays; competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for ELISAs, including Meso Scale Discovery, PerkinElmer, Thermo Fisher, Luminex, Millipore, Molecular Devices, Tecan BioTek, and Bio-Rad Laboratories. The primary competitors for our Biologics instrumentation are Agilent Technologies, Danaher and PerkinElmer, as well as GE Healthcare, Shimadzu, Thermo Fisher and Waters. We believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality. 

&#160; 

Protein Platforms Segment Manufacturing. 

&#160; 

We manufacture our Simple Western products at our facility in San Jose, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our Biologics instruments and consumables are manufactured at our facilities in Toronto and Ottawa, both located in Ontario, Canada. We manufacture our Simple Plex products at our facility in Wallingford, Connecticut. We manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value, but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables, components, subassemblies and autosamplers used with, or included in, our systems, which are manufactured to our specifications. We are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. We conduct all final testing and inspection of our products. We have established a quality control program, including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

There was no significant backlog of orders for our Protein Platforms products as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2015.

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

Bio-Techne is engaged in continuous ongoing research and development in all of our major product lines. We believe that our future success depends, to a large extent, on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, Bio-Techne introduced approximately 1,600 new biotechnology products to the life science market. All of these products are for research use only and therefore did not require FDA clearance. We also expect to significantly expand our portfolio of products through acquisitions of existing businesses. However, there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or, if completed, can be successfully introduced into the marketplace.

&#160; 

On July 31, 2014, Bio-Techne closed on the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of ProteinSimple for approximately $300 million. The purchase price was adjusted post-closing based on the final levels of cash and working capital of ProteinSimple at closing. ProteinSimple develops, markets and sells Western-blotting instruments, biologics and reagents. Western blotting remains one of the most frequently practiced life science techniques, and ProteinSimple&#8217;s tools allow researchers to perform this basic research technique with greater speed and efficiency. Automation of the Western blotting technique has the potential to drive additional sales of the consumables Bio-Techne already sells, especially antibodies which have been validated for Western blotting applications. The ProteinSimple products became the foundation of our Protein Platforms segment. 

&#160; 

On July 2, 2014, Bio-Techne acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Novus Biologicals, for approximately $60.0 million. Novus Biologicals is a Littleton, Colorado-based supplier of a large portfolio of both outsourced and in-house developed antibodies and other biologicals for life science research, delivered through an innovative digital commerce platform. The acquisition further expanded our antibody portfolio, consistent with our long term strategic business plan to serve customers with a complete and quality line of reagents, and became a part of our Biotechnology segment. 

&#160; 

Fiscal 2014 Investments and Acquisitions 

&#160; 

After investing $10.0 million in CyVek on April 1, 2014, Bio-Techne&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, R &#38; D Systems, Inc. acquired all of CyVek&#8217;s equity on November 4, 2014 for approximately $60.0 million. Bio-Techne completed the acquisition as a result of CyVek meeting certain pre-agreed commercial milestones. We will pay CyVek stockholders up to an additional $35.0 million based on the revenue generated by CyVek&#8217;s products and related products before May 4, 2017. We will also pay CyVek&#8217;s stockholders 50% of the amount, if any, by which the revenue from CyVek&#8217;s products and related products exceeds $100 million in calendar year 2020. This strategic investment allowed us to offer the SimplePlex platform as part of our Protein Platforms segment, strengthening our market position in the immunoassay market where multiplex testing platforms are becoming more significant. 

&#160; 

On April 30, 2014, Bio-Techne&#8217;s China affiliate, R&#38;D Systems China, acquired PrimeGene for approximately $18.8 million. PrimeGene is a leader in the China market in the development and manufacture of recombinant proteins for research and industrial applications, and has large scale protein manufacturing capabilities to serve the Chinese market as well as global industrial customers. PrimeGene is included in Bio-Techne&#8217;s Biotechnology segment. 

&#160; 

On July 22, 2013, the Company&#8217;s R&#38;D Systems subsidiary acquired for approximately $103 million cash all of the outstanding shares of Bionostics. Bionostics is a global leader in the development, manufacture and distribution of control solutions that verify the proper operation of in-vitro diagnostic devices primarily utilized in point of care blood glucose and blood gas testing. Bionostics is included in Bio-Techne&#8217;s Clinical Controls segment.

&#160;

&#160;

Prior Investments 

&#160; 

Bio-Techne has an approximate 14% equity investment in ChemoCentryx, Inc. (CCXI). CCXI is a technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines. Chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes, the effector cells of the human immune system. Bio-Techne&#8217;s investment in CCXI is included in &#8220;Short-term available-for-sale investments&#8221; at June 30, 2016 and 2015 at fair values of $28.6 million and $52.3 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

All manufacturers of clinical diagnostic controls and reagents are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended. Most of Bio-Techne&#8217;s Clinical Control segment products are classified as " in vitro diagnostic products" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The entire manufacturing process, from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of products through their expiration date, is strictly regulated and documented. FDA inspectors make periodic site inspections of Bio-Techne&#8217;s Clinical Control operations and facilities. Clinical Control segment manufacturing must comply with Quality System Regulations (QSR) as set forth in the FDA&#8217;s regulations governing medical devices. 

&#160; 

Three of Bio-Techne&#8217;s immunoassay kits, EPO, TfR and b2M, have FDA clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use. Bio-Techne must comply with QSR for the manufacture of these kits. Biotechnology products manufactured in the U.S. and sold for use in the research market do not require FDA clearance. The products manufactured and sold through our Protein Platforms segment are all sold for research use only and also do not require FDA clearance. Tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization. However, some of Tocris&#8217; products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to end-users. Bio-Techne has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be re-issued. 

&#160; 

Bio-Techne is subject to the medical device excise tax which was included as part of the Affordable Care Act. The tax applies to the sale of medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of the device and is 2.3% of the sale price. The tax applies to Bio-Techne&#8217;s in vitro diagnostic products, including its clinical control products and biotechnology clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

&#160; 

Our success depends at least in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. As of June 30, 2016, we had rights to 76 granted patents and approximately 70 pending patent applications, primarily relating to our Protein Platforms products. Patent protection, if granted, generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant. We cannot assure you whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent, whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors&#8217; products or services. Bio-Techne is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection. 

&#160; 

In addition to pursuing patents on our products, we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets. We have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. 

&#160; 

No assurance can be given that Bio-Techne&#8217;s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others, particularly for genetically engineered products. Bio-Techne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products. Where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights, Bio-Techne has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive and/or non-exclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research market. In addition, certain of our Protein Platforms products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio. 

&#160; 

Bio-Techne has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its brand and product names. Bio-Techne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Biotechnology and Protein Platforms segment products marketed by Bio-Techne historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months. Bio-Techne also usually experiences a slowing of sales in all of its reportable segments during the Thanksgiving to New Year holiday period. Bio-Techne believes this seasonality is a result of vacation and academic schedules of its world-wide customer base. A majority of Clinical Controls products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer. Consequently, sales for that segment can be unpredictable, although not necessarily based on seasonality. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

Through its subsidiaries, Bio-Techne employed approximately 1,560 full-time and part-time employees as of June 30, 2016.
