 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a self-managed healthcare real estate company organized in April 2013 to acquire, selectively develop, own and manage healthcare properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery systems. We completed our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) in July 2013. Our common shares are listed on the NYSE and we are included in the MSCI US REIT Index. 

We have grown our portfolio of gross real estate investments from approximately $124 million at the time of our IPO to approximately $1.7 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio consisted of 151 &#32;properties located in 26 &#32;states with approximately 5,799,337 &#32;net leasable square feet, which were approximately 95.8% &#32;leased with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 9.0 &#32;years and approximately 74% &#32;of the net leasable square footage of our portfolio was either affiliated with a healthcare delivery system or located within approximately 1/4 mile of a hospital campus. 

We receive a cash rental stream from healthcare providers under our leases. Approximately 85.5% &#32;of the annualized base rent payments from our properties as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are from triple net leases, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property, including but not limited to real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance, routine maintenance and repairs, and property management. This structure helps insulate us from increases in certain operating expenses and provides relatively predictable cash flow. We seek to structure our triple net leases to generate attractive returns on a long-term basis. Our leases typically have initial terms of five to 15 years and include annual rent escalators of approximately 2.0% to 3.0% . Our operating results depend significantly upon the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments. We believe that our portfolio of medical office buildings and other healthcare facilities will enable us to generate stable cash flows over time because of the diversity of our tenants, staggered lease expiration schedule, long-term leases, and low historical occurrence of tenants defaulting under their leases. As of December 31, 2015 , leases representing a percentage of our portfolio on the basis of leasable square feet will expire as follows:

The difference between the 95.8% &#32;leased as of December 31, 2015 as noted above, compared to the 95.0% noted in this table is 0.8%, which is due to leases that expired on December 31, 2015. Of those, 0.6% rolled into new long-term leases and 0.2% are vacant as of January 1, 2016. Vacancy totaled 4.2%. 

We invest in real estate that is integral to providing high quality healthcare services. Our properties are typically located on a campus with a hospital or other healthcare facilities or strategically located and affiliated with a hospital or other healthcare system. We believe the impact of government programs and continuing trends in the healthcare industry create attractive opportunities for us to invest in healthcare-related real estate. Our management team has significant public healthcare REIT experience and has long established relationships with physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery system decision makers that we believe will provide quality investment and growth opportunities. Our principal investments include medical office buildings, outpatient treatment facilities, and other real estate integral to health care providers. We seek to invest in stabilized medical facility assets with initial cash yields of 6% to 9% . 

&#160; 

We had no business operations prior to completion of the IPO and the related formation transactions on July 24, 2013. Our Predecessor, which is not a legal entity, is comprised of the four healthcare real estate funds managed by B.C. Ziegler &#38; Company, which we refer to as the Ziegler Funds, that owned directly or indirectly interests in entities that owned our initial properties we acquired on July 24, 2013 in connection with completion of our IPO and related formation transactions. 

&#160; 

We are a Maryland real estate investment trust and elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership REIT structure in which our properties are owned by our operating partnership directly or through limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and, as of February 22, 2016 , own approximately 96.7% &#32;of the partnership interests in our operating partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;). 

Our Objectives and Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Our principal business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders through a combination of (i) sustainable and increasing rental revenue and cash flow that generate reliable, increasing dividends, and (ii) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties and common shares. Our primary strategies to achieve our business objective are to invest in, own and manage a diversified portfolio of high quality healthcare properties and pay careful attention to our tenants&#8217; real estate strategies, which we believe will drive high retention, high occupancy and reliable, increasing rental revenue and cash flow. 

&#160; 

We intend to grow our portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties leased to physicians, hospitals, healthcare delivery systems and other healthcare providers primarily through acquisitions of existing healthcare facilities that provide stable revenue growth and predictable long-term cash flows. We may also selectively finance the development of new healthcare facilities through joint venture or fee arrangements with premier healthcare real estate developers. Generally, we only expect to make investments in new development properties when approximately 70% or more of the development property has been pre-leased before construction commences. We seek to invest in properties where we can develop strategic alliances with financially sound healthcare providers and healthcare delivery systems that offer need-based healthcare services in sustainable healthcare markets. We focus our investment activity on the following types of healthcare properties: 

&#8226; 

medical office buildings; 

&#8226; 

outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities; 

&#8226; 

physician group practice clinics; 

&#8226; 

ambulatory surgery centers; and 

&#8226; 

specialty hospitals and treatment centers. 

&#160; 

We may invest opportunistically in life science facilities, assisted living and independent senior living facilities and in the longer term, senior housing properties, including skilled nursing. Consistent with our intent to qualify as a REIT, we may also opportunistically invest in companies that provide healthcare services, and in joint venture entities with operating partners, structured to comply with the REIT Investment Diversification Act of 2007 (&#8220;RIDEA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In connection with our review and consideration of healthcare real estate investment opportunities, we generally take into account a variety of market considerations, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

whether the property is anchored by a financially-sound healthcare delivery system or whether tenants have strong affiliation to a healthcare delivery system; 

&#8226; 

the performance of the local healthcare delivery system and its future prospects; 

&#8226; 

property location, with a particular emphasis on proximity to healthcare delivery systems; 

&#8226; 

demand for medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities, current and future supply of competing properties, and occupancy and rental rates in the market; 

&#8226; 

population density and growth potential; 

&#8226; 

ability to achieve economies of scale with our existing medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities or anticipated investment opportunities; and 

&#8226; 

existing and potential competition from other healthcare real estate owners and operators. 

&#160; 

2015 Highlights and Other Recent Developments 

&#8226; 

For the full year 2015, we completed acquisitions of 66 &#32;medical office facilities located in 22 &#32;states, containing an aggregate of 2,745,664 &#32;net leasable square feet, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $818.6 million . 

&#8226; 

In January 2015, we completed a follow-on public offering of 18,975,000 common shares of beneficial interest, including 2,475,000 common shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters&#8217; overallotment option, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $297.3 million . 

&#8226; 

In July 2015, we amended our existing credit facility, increasing the maximum principal amount available under our unsecured revolving credit facility from $400 million to $750 million. The credit facility includes a swingline loan commitment for up to 10% of the maximum principal amount and provides an accordion feature allowing us to increase borrowing capacity by up to an additional $350 million, subject to customary terms and conditions, resulting in a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion. 

&#8226; 

Effective October 1, 2015, we appointed Deeni Taylor to the position of Executive Vice President &#8211; Investments. Additionally, effective February 2, 2015, we appointed Bradley D. Page to the position of Senior Vice President &#8211; General Counsel. 

&#8226; 

In October 2015, we completed a follow-on public offering of 15,812,500 common shares of beneficial interest, including 2,062,500 common shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters&#8217; overallotment option, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $226.8 million . 

&#8226; 

On January 7, 2016, we issued and sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate and working capital purposes and funding acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

In January 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering of 21,275,000 common shares of beneficial interest, including 2,775,000 common shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters&#8217; overallotment option, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $320.9 million . 

&#8226; 

From January 1, 2016 to February 22, 2016 , we completed 8 &#32;acquisitions of 7 &#32;properties and 1 &#32;condominium unit located in 8 &#32;states, containing an aggregate of 326,326 &#32;net leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $105.1 million . We also issued 1 &#32;mezzanine loan for $0.5 million . 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 25 &#32;full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are positive. 

Portfolio Summary 

&#160; 

Please see &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8221; for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Geographic Concentration 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 34.8% &#32;of our total annualized base rent was derived from properties located in Texas ( 15.7% ), Georgia ( 9.8% ), and Arizona ( 9.3% ). The Texas properties are concentrated in El Paso and Dallas, the Georgia properties are concentrated in the metro Atlanta area, and the Arizona properties are concentrated in Phoenix and Scottsdale. 

As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in these local economies or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in either of these areas could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. In the event of negative economic or other changes in either of these markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected. See each of the discussion under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;Economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas in which we conduct business, and in particular areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.&#8221; 

Customer Concentration 

&#160; 

We receive substantially all of our revenue as rent payments from tenants under leases of space in our healthcare properties, with our five largest tenants based upon rental revenue representing approximately $19.1 million , or 15.5% , of the annualized base rent from our properties as of December 31, 2015 . No one tenant represents more than 3.9% &#32;of our total annualized base rent. We have no control over the success or failure of our tenants&#8217; businesses and, at any time, any of our tenants may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare-related real estate properties and other investors such as private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The competition for healthcare-related real estate properties may significantly increase the price that we must pay for healthcare properties or other assets that we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs that target healthcare properties may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, enhanced operating efficiencies, more personnel and market penetration and familiarity with markets. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. Increased competition would result in increased demand for the same assets and therefore increase prices paid for them. Those higher prices for healthcare properties or other assets may adversely affect our returns from our investments. 

&#160; 

Credit Facility 

&#160; 

On July 22, 2015, the Operating Partnership, as borrower, and we and certain subsidiaries and other affiliates of our company, as guarantors, entered into an amendment to the existing credit agreement with KeyBank National Association as administrative agent, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Regions Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, Regions Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets, as co-syndication agents, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) which increased the maximum principal amount available under an unsecured revolving credit facility from $400 million to $750 million. The Credit Agreement includes a swingline loan commitment for up to 10% of the maximum principal amount and provides an accordion feature allowing us to increase borrowing capacity by up to an additional $350 million, subject to customary terms and conditions, resulting in a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion. 

The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of September 18, 2019 and includes a one &#32;year extension option. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at an adjusted LIBOR rate, which is based on the Trust&#8217;s investment grade rating under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2015 , the Trust had an investment grade rating from Moody&#8217;s of Baa3 and as such, borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrued interest on the outstanding principal at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.20% . The Credit Agreement includes a facility fee equal to 0.25% &#32;per annum, which is also determined by the Trust&#8217;s investment grade rating. 

&#160; 

The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, require compliance with leverage and coverage ratios and maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, as well as covenants that may limit our and the Operating Partnership&#8217;s ability to incur additional debt or make distributions. We may, at any time, voluntarily prepay any loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part without premium or penalty. As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 

&#160; 

The Credit Agreement includes customary representations and warranties by the Operating Partnership, us and each other guarantor and imposes customary covenants on the Operating Partnership, us and each other guarantor. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and if an event of default occurs and continues, the Operating Partnership is subject to certain actions by the administrative agent, including without limitation, the acceleration of repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 

&#160; 

The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans to the Operating Partnership. Base Rate Loans, Adjusted LIBOR Rate Loans and Letters of Credit (each, as defined in the Credit Agreement) will be subject to interest rates, based upon our investment grade rating as follows:

As of December 31, 2015 , there were $395 million &#32;of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $198.7 million &#32;available for us to borrow without adding additional properties to the unencumbered borrowing base of assets, as defined by the Credit Agreement. 

Additionally, on January 7, 2016, our Operating Partnership issued and sold $150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, comprised of (i) $15,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.03% Senior Notes, Series A, due January 7, 2023 (the &#8220;Series A Notes&#8221;), (ii) $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.43% Senior Notes, Series B, due January 7, 2026 (the &#8220;Series B Notes&#8221;), (iii) $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.57% Senior Notes, Series C, due January 7, 2028 (the &#8220;Series C Notes&#8221;) and (iv) $45,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.74% Senior Notes, Series D, due January 7, 2031 (the &#8220;Series D Notes,&#8221; and together with the Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the Series C Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). The proceeds of the Notes were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate and working capital purposes and funding acquisitions. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business has not been and we do not expect it to become subject to material seasonal fluctuations. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties as a result of environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties even if we no longer own such properties. See the discussion under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our properties may affect our results of operations.&#8221; 

Certain Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations, reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could adversely impact our company and result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators as of December 31, 2015 &#32;we estimate that approximately 44.0% &#32;of our hospital and long-term acute care hospital tenants&#8217; and operators&#8217; revenues were dependent on Medicare reimbursement. 

&#160; 

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us. 

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement 

&#160; 

There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers&#8217; relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need 

&#160; 

Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants&#8217; and operators&#8217; abilities to expand or change their businesses.
