 Item 1. Business 

The Company, formed in November 2007 as a Virginia corporation, is a self-advised real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) that invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 179 hotels operating in 32 states with an aggregate of 22,961 rooms. All of the Company&#8217;s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company has wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which lease all of the Company&#8217;s hotels from wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiaries. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 20 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. 

On May 18, 2015, the Company&#8217;s common shares were listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;APLE&#8221; (the &#8220;Listing&#8221;). In connection with the Listing, effective May 18, 2015, the Company completed a 50% reverse share split. As a result of the reverse share split, every two common shares were converted into one common share. Except where the context indicates otherwise, all common shares and per share amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse share split. 

The Company has no foreign operations or assets and its operating structure includes only one reportable segment. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Refer to Part II, Item 8, for the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Business Objectives 

&#160; 

The Company is one of the largest hospitality REITs, in both the number of hotels and guest rooms in the United States, with significant geographic and brand diversity. The Company&#8217;s primary business objective is to maximize shareholder value by achieving long-term growth in cash available for distributions to its shareholders. The Company has pursued and will continue to pursue this objective through the following investment strategies: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

thoughtful capital allocation with selective acquisitions and dispositions of primarily hotels; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

focusing on investments in the upscale sector of the lodging industry; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

broad geographic diversification of its investments; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

partnering with leading brands in the sector; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

utilizing strong experienced operators for the hotels and enhancing their performance with proactive asset management; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reinvesting in the hotels to maintain their competitive advantage; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

maintaining low leverage providing the Company with financial flexibility. 

&#160;

The Company has generally acquired fee ownership of its properties, with a focus on hotels with diverse demand generators, strong brand recognition, the potential for high levels of customer satisfaction and strong operating margins. The acquisitions have been in broadly diversified markets across the United States to limit dependence on any one geographic area or demand generator. With an emphasis on upscale select service hotels, the Company utilizes its asset management expertise to improve the quality and performance of its hotels by working with its property managers to aggressively manage room rates and cost structure by benchmarking with internal and external data, using scale to help negotiate favorable vendor contracts, partnering with industry leaders in hotel management, and franchising the hotels with leading brands and actively participating with the franchisors to strengthen the brands. To maintain its competitive advantage in each market, the Company continually reinvests in its hotels. With its depth of ownership in particular brands and extensive experience with the Hilton and Marriott upscale brands, the Company has been able to enhance its reinvestment approach. By maintaining a flexible balance sheet, with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 of 3.1 times, the Company is positioned to opportunistically consider investments that further improve shareholder value. 

Comparable Hotels Operating Performance 

&#160; 

The following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company&#8217;s 179 hotels owned as of December 31, 2015 (&#8220;Comparable Hotels&#8221;). The Company defines metrics from Comparable Hotels as results generated by the 179 hotels owned as of the end of the reporting period. For the hotels acquired during the period, the Company has included, as applicable, results of those hotels for periods prior to the Company&#8217;s ownership, and for dispositions, results have been excluded for the Company&#8217;s period of ownership.

&#160; $ 100.59 &#160; &#160; $ 94.41 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6.5 % 

Hotel performance is impacted by many factors, including the economic conditions in the United States as well as each locality. Economic conditions in the United States have generally been favorable, which continues to overall positively impact the lodging industry. As a result, during 2015, the industry and the Company experienced increases in both occupancy and ADR. Although certain markets will vary based on local supply/demand dynamics and local market economic conditions, with continued overall demand and room rate improvement and the Company&#8217;s geographically diverse portfolio of upscale, select service hotels, the Company, on a comparable basis, and industry are forecasting a low to mid-single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on recent revenue trends, the anticipated revenue growth rates for 2016 are slightly lower than the growth achieved in 2015 and 2014. See Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Company&#8217;s results of operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

2015 Investing Activities 

The Company continually monitors the profitability of its properties, market conditions, and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by timely disposal of properties and using the proceeds to invest in properties that it believes provide greater value in the long term. &#160; Consistent with this strategy and the Company&#8217;s focus on investing in upscale select service hotels, the Company acquired seven hotels for an aggregate purchase price of $254.8 million in 2015: a 156-room Hampton Inn in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a 110-room Hampton Inn in Cypress, California, a new 170-room SpringHill Suites and a 190-room Courtyard, both in Burbank, California, a 245-room Courtyard in San Diego, California and an adjoining 102-room Courtyard and 78-room Residence Inn complex located in Syracuse, New York. The purchase price for each of these properties, net of debt assumed, was funded through the Company&#8217;s credit facility with availability provided primarily from the proceeds from the sale of 19 properties during 2015 (13 of which were acquired in the Apple REIT Seven, Inc. and Apple REIT Eight, Inc. mergers discussed below, effective March 1, 2014). As of December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of four additional hotels with a total gross purchase price of $81.1 million that are under construction and are planned to be completed and opened for business in 2016 and 2017, at which time closings are expected to occur. 

In connection with the Listing, the Company completed a modified &#8220;Dutch Auction&#8221; tender offer (the &#8220;Tender Offer&#8221;). Upon completion of the Tender Offer in June 2015, the Company purchased 10.5 million of its common shares, at a purchase price of $19.00 per common share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200 million excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer. The Company funded the Tender Offer and all related costs primarily from borrowings under its credit facility. 

The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million, and effective July 8, 2015, as part of the implementation of the program, the Company established a written trading plan (&#8220;Plan&#8221;) that provided for share repurchases in open market transactions. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 1.2 million common shares were purchased under the Plan, at a weighted-average market price of approximately $17.61 per common share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $22.0 million. Purchases under the Plan were funded with availability under the Company&#8217;s credit facility. To be able to more effectively respond to market conditions, the Company terminated the Plan in January 2016. The Company plans to continue to consider opportunistic share repurchases under the $478 million remaining portion of its authorized $500 million share repurchase program. 

Mergers with Apple REIT Seven, Inc. and Apple REIT Eight, Inc. 

Effective March 1, 2014, the Company completed its mergers with Apple REIT Seven, Inc. (&#8220;Apple Seven&#8221;) and Apple REIT Eight, Inc. (&#8220;Apple Eight&#8221;) (the &#8220;A7 and A8 mergers&#8221;) and added 99 continuing hotels located in 27 states, with an aggregate of 12,121 rooms, to the Company&#8217;s real estate portfolio. See Note 2 titled &#8220;Mergers with Apple REIT Seven, Inc. and Apple REIT Eight, Inc.&#8221; in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information concerning the A7 and A8 mergers. 

Hotel Industry and Competition 

&#160; 

The hotel industry is highly competitive. Each of the Company&#8217;s hotels competes for guests primarily with other hotels in the Company&#8217;s immediate vicinity and secondarily with other hotels or lodging facilities in the Company&#8217;s geographic market. An increase in the number of competitive hotels or other lodging facilities in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy, average daily rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) and revenue per available room (&#8220;RevPAR&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s hotels in that area. The Company believes that brand recognition, location, price and quality (of both the hotel and the services provided) are the principal competitive factors affecting the Company&#8217;s hotels. Additionally, general economic conditions in a particular market and nationally impact the performance of the hotel industry. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; Management and Franchise Agreements 

All of the Company&#8217;s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands, and as of December 31, 2015, consisted of the following:

&#160; &#160; 179 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22,961 &#160; 

&#160; 

Each of the Company&#8217;s 179 hotels owned as of December 31, 2015 is operated and managed under separate management agreements with 20 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The agreements generally provide for initial terms of one to 30 years. Fees associated with the agreements generally include the payment of base management fees, incentive management fees, accounting fees, and other fees for centralized services, which are allocated among all of the hotels that receive the benefit of such services. Base management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. Incentive management fees are calculated as a percentage of operating profit in excess of a priority return to the Company, as defined in the management agreements. The Company has the option to terminate the management agreements if specified performance thresholds are not satisfied. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company modified its management fee structure for approximately 70% of the Company&#8217;s hotels. Under the new management fee structure, the hotel management fee for each hotel will generally be within a range of 2.5% to 3.5% of revenue based on each hotel&#8217;s performance relative to other hotels owned by the Company. The performance measures are based on various financial and quality performance metrics. Under the new management agreements, the new fee replaces the base and incentive fee under the old agreements. The change is not anticipated to significantly impact total management fees for the Company, but is anticipated to better align incentives for each property. 

Thirteen of the Company&#8217;s hotels are managed by affiliates of Marriott or Hilton. The remainder of the Company&#8217;s hotels are managed by companies that are not affiliated with either Marriott or Hilton, and as a result, the hotels they manage were required to obtain separate franchise agreements with each respective franchisor. The franchise agreements generally provide for initial terms of approximately 10 to 30 years and generally provide for renewals subject to franchise requirements at the time of renewal. The Company pays various fees under these agreements, including the payment of royalty fees, marketing fees, reservation fees, a communications support fee and other similar fees based on room revenues. 

&#160;

The franchise and/or management agreements provide a variety of benefits for the Company, which include national advertising, publicity, and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous review of quality standards, centralized reservation systems and best practices within the industry. 

&#160; Hotel Maintenance and Renovation 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s hotels have an ongoing need for renovation and refurbishment. To maintain and enhance each property&#8217;s competitive position in its market, the Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. During 2015 and 2014, the Company&#8217;s capital improvements for existing hotels were approximately $58.9 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

million and $48.3 million. During 2016, the Company anticipates investing approximately $50 to $60 million in capital improvements, which includes various scheduled renovation projects for approximately 25 properties. 

Financing 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of liquidity are the operating cash flow generated from the Company&#8217;s properties and its $965 million credit facility. The Company anticipates that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements, including debt service, hotel acquisitions, hotel renovations, and required distributions to shareholders (the Company is not required to make distributions at its current rate for REIT purposes). 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $462.5 million in outstanding property level debt secured by 39 properties, with maturity dates ranging from January 2016 to October 2032 and stated interest rates ranging from 0% to 6.90%. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s credit facility had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $539.8 million, with approximately $425.2 million in borrowing capacity under the $540 million revolving portion of its credit facility. The credit facility is available for share repurchases, acquisitions, hotel renovations and development, working capital and other general corporate funding purposes, including the payment of distributions to shareholders. As discussed above, the Company has historically and plans in the future to maintain relatively low leverage as compared to the real estate industry as a whole and the lodging sector in particular. The Company&#8217;s ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 3.1 times. The Company may increase debt levels at any time to take advantage of investment opportunities, but would plan to reduce any significant increases in the short term with the issuance of equity or property dispositions to maintain its flexible balance sheet and reduce risks to investors compared to those of highly leveraged companies. The Company plans to maintain staggered maturities of its debt, utilize unsecured debt when available and fix the rate on the majority of its debt. All of these strategies reduce shareholder risk related to the Company&#8217;s financing structure. See Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the credit facility. 

Distribution Policy 

The Company plans to continue to pay a consistent distribution on a monthly basis, with distributions based on anticipated cash generated from operations. The Company&#8217;s annualized distribution rate was $1.20 per common share at December 31, 2015. As it has done historically, due to seasonality, the Company may use its credit facility to maintain the consistency of the monthly distribution rate, taking into consideration any acquisitions, dispositions, capital improvements and economic cycles. Any distribution is subject to approval of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and there can be no assurance of the classification or duration of distributions at the current annual distribution rate. The Board of Directors monitors the Company&#8217;s distribution rate relative to the performance of its hotels on an ongoing basis and may make adjustments to the distribution rate as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company. If the Company were unable to extend its maturing debt in future periods or if it were to default on its debt, it may be unable to make distributions. 

Insurance 

The Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of its hotels. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that the Company believes are customary for similar types of properties. However, various types of catastrophic losses, like earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism, may not be insurable or may not be economically insurable. 

&#160; Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and waste water discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management, and impose liability for contamination. In connection with each of the Company&#8217;s hotel acquisitions, the Company reviewed a Phase I Environmental Report and additional environmental reports and surveys, as were 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

necessitated by the preliminary report. Based on the reports, the Company is not aware of any environmental situations requiring remediation at the Company&#8217;s properties, which have not been, or are not currently being remediated as necessary. No material remediation costs have occurred or are expected to occur. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose the Company to the possibility that it may become liable to reimburse governments for damages and costs they incur in connection with hazardous substances. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The hotel industry historically has been seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company&#8217;s hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements. 

Related Parties 

The Company has, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm&#8217;s length and the results of the Company&#8217;s operations may be different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. The Company&#8217;s independent members of the Board of Directors oversee and annually review the Company&#8217;s related party relationships and are required to approve any significant modifications to the existing relationships, as well as any new significant related party transactions. The Board of Directors is not required to approve each individual transaction that falls under the related party relationships. However, under the direction of the Board of Directors, at least one member of the Company&#8217;s senior management team approves each related party transaction. 

Effective March 1, 2014, the Company completed its mergers with Apple Seven and Apple Eight. In connection with the completion of the A7 and A8 mergers, the Company became self-advised and Apple Seven, Apple Eight and the Company terminated their advisory agreements with their respective advisors. In addition, from and after the A7 and A8 mergers, the Company provides to Apple REIT Ten, Inc. (&#8220;Apple Ten&#8221;) the advisory services contemplated under the Apple Ten Advisors, Inc. (&#8220;A10A&#8221;) advisory agreement and the Company receives fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the A10A advisory agreement from Apple Ten. The Company also provides support services to Apple Ten&#8217;s advisors, A10A and Apple Suites Realty Group, Inc. (&#8220;ASRG&#8221;), which have agreed to reimburse the Company for its costs in providing these services. 

Prior to the A7 and A8 mergers, Glade M. Knight, Executive Chairman of the Company and formerly Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Seven and Apple Eight and is currently Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Ten. The former advisors of Apple Seven, Apple Eight and the Company, and the advisors of Apple Ten, are wholly owned by Mr. Knight. Mr. Knight is also a partner and Chief Executive Officer of Energy 11 GP, LLC, which is the general partner of Energy 11, L.P. Prior to the A7 and A8 mergers, members of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors were also on the Board of Directors of Apple Seven and/or Apple Eight. Prior to January 1, 2015, one member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors was also on the Board of Directors of Apple Ten. Justin G. Knight, the Company&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Apple Ten&#8217;s President, is also a member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

See Note 8 titled &#8220;Related Parties&#8221; in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Company&#8217;s related party transactions. 

Employees 

&#160; 

During 2015, all employees involved in the day-to-day operation of the Company&#8217;s hotels were employed by third party management companies engaged pursuant to the hotel management agreements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had 54 employees. The employees not only provide support to the Company, but, as discussed herein, under Related Parties, they also provide support to various related parties, including Apple Ten, ASRG and A10A.
