 Item 1. Business. 

INTRODUCTION

Logicquest Technology, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was originally incorporated as Solis Communications, Inc. on July 23, 2001 and adopted a name change to Crescent Communications Inc. upon completion of a reverse acquisition of Berens Industries, Inc. In 2004, we changed our name to Bluegate Corporation (&#147;Bluegate&#148;). On March 19, 2015, we changed our name to Logicquest Technology, Inc.

Logicquest is a Nevada corporation that previously consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business, which provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider. During May 2014 the Board of Directors authorized an orderly wind down of the Company's internet connectivity business which ceased effective June 30, 2014.

In this Form 10-K, we refer to ourselves as &#34;Logicquest,&#34; &#34;We,&#34; Us,&#34; &#147;the Company,&#148; and &#34;Our.&#34;

Our growth is dependent on attaining profit from acquiring new operations and our raising capital through the sale of stock or debt. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit.

Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued a going concern qualification in their report dated March 30, 2016, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

CORPORATE HISTORY

In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#34;HIPAA&#34;). Two of the many features of HIPAA were a mandate that the healthcare industry move toward using electronic communication technology to streamline and reduce the cost of healthcare, and a requirement that healthcare providers treat virtually all healthcare information as confidential, especially when electronically transmitted.

In 2001, Mr. Manfred Sternberg acquired effective control of the company and during 2002 and 2003 under his leadership, the company commenced development and completion of the necessary systems to offer integrated HIPAA compliant Medical Grade Network&#174; to the health care community to provide electronic systems required by increasing U.S. public policy mandates to accelerate the movement to secure electronic health records.

In 2003, a minority amount of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2004, a majority of our revenue was related to our HIPAA business. In 2005, all of our revenues were related to our health care service model.

In 2004, to accelerate our movement into the electronic health record business, we sold our Internet Service Provider (&#34;ISP&#34;) customer base effective June 21, 2004 to concentrate on our health care IT solutions model and its Medical Grade Network&#174;.

In 2004, we contracted with the largest healthcare system in Texas to provide physicians with Internet bandwidth and managed security services using our Medical Grade Network&#174;.

In March 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of TEKMedia Communications, Inc., a company that provided traditional IT consulting services.

In September 2005 we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain ongoing contractual obligations of Trilliant Corporation, a company that provides assessment, design, vendor selection, procurement and project management for large technology initiatives, particularly in the healthcare arena.

Effective May 31, 2009, Mr. Koehler resigned as President from the company.

&#160;

Effective July 29, 2009, Charles Leibold became a Director as a result of: (A) the June 12, 2009 written consent of a majority of our shareholders; (B) the June 22, 2009 filing of a Preliminary Information Statement; (C) the July 8, 2009 filing of a Definitive Information Statement; and, (D) the July 9, 2009 mailing of the Definitive Information Statement to our shareholders. The Definitive Information Statement had a record date of June 25, 2009.

Effective July 30, 2009, the titles of CEO and President were combined, and Stephen Sperco was appointed President. Mr. Sperco is our former CEO/President/Director. Stephen Sperco was appointed Chairman of the Board. The executive officer position of Chief Strategy Officer was eliminated and Mr. Sternberg&#146;s employment was terminated.

Effective November 7, 2009, the Company entered into the following transactions: 1) disposed of certain Medical Grade Network (&#147;MGN&#148;) assets and business and the elimination of certain liabilities (consisting primarily of: a) furniture, computers and related software and peripherals with a $17,889 book value; b) contracts, agreements, lists of telephone and fax numbers, licenses, permits, intellectual properties, registered mark for MGN, and business name of Bluegate with a $0 net book value; c) eliminated liabilities of $43,607 principally related to customer product prepays which were assumed by the purchaser) to Sperco, LLC (&#147;Sperco&#148;) (an entity controlled by Stephen Sperco (&#147;SS&#148;), our former CEO/President/Director) for $200,000, with payment made by a combination of $100,000 cash and $100,000 forgiveness of debt to SAI Corporation (&#147;SAIC&#148;) (an entity controlled by SS), plus a net adjustment of $7,100 due to the Company from Sperco resulting from the Company&#146;s collection of principally accounts receivable totaling $161,900 on behalf of Sperco for the period from November 8, 2009 through December 31, 2009, offset by Sperco&#146;s payment of $169,000 to the Company for the personnel, facilities, tools, and resources necessary for the Company to support both the MGN and HIMS operations for Sperco for the same period; 2) entered into a Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with Manfred Sternberg (&#147;MS&#148;) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,369 to MS; and 3) entered into A Separation Agreement and Mutual Release in Full of all claims with William Koehler (&#147;WK&#148;) (former Director/Corporate Officer), which included the elimination of $28,499 of accrued director fees and vehicle allowances in exchange for repayment of a loan plus accrued interest totaling $44,374 with a direct payment to WK&#146;s American Express account and a $1 payment to WK; and 4) disposed of certain Trilliant Technology Group, Inc.&#146;s assets and business (consisting primarily of: a) Computers and related software and peripherals with a $0 net book value; b) lists of telephone and fax numbers and intellectual properties with a $0 net book value) to Trilliant Corporation (an entity controlled by WK) for a cash payment of $5,000; and 5) disposed of certain Bluegate Healthcare Information Management Systems (&#147;HIMS&#148;) assets and business (consisting primarily of: a) Contracts, agreements and intellectual properties with a $0 net book value) to SAIC in exchange for a Mutual Release in Full of certain claims and a $1 payment to SAIC; and 6) obtained a Fairness Opinion dated November 6, 2009 presented by Convergent Capital Appraisers.

Pursuant to the State of Nevada Revised Statutes, which authorizes the taking of action by written consent of the shareholders without a meeting, a super majority of the voting power of the shareholders of the Company gave their consent to the above actions. In April 2010, the Company filed a Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC and mailed the notice to shareholders.

As a result of these transactions, the Company received $105,000 cash; reduced the secured note payable to SAIC by $100,000; paid off unsecured notes payable and accrued interest of $88,743 to MS and WK; eliminated $56,998 of accrued liabilities to MS and WK; recorded $24,234 of expenses (principally legal and professional); removed the remaining book value of fixed assets of $17,889, eliminated $43,607 of customer liabilities assumed by Sperco and the net effect of $263,484 as an increase to additional paid-in capital since the effect was treated as related party forgiveness of debt.

On December 27, 2010 our 100% owned subsidiary, Trilliant Technology Group, Inc. was dissolved.

On September 11, 2014, SAIC, the Company&#146;s majority shareholder, sold to Mr. Ang Woon Han 24,070,250 shares of common stock (1,203,513 shares post reverse stock split), 48 shares of Series C Convertible preferred stock and 10 shares of Series D Convertible preferred stock. As a result, Mr. Ang owns 52% of our shares of common stock without taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred stock, and 78% when taking into account the super voting power of the Preferred Stock.

On January 2, 2015, the Company had filed a 14C for restructuring the Company. Actions taken included:

&#183;

To change the name of the Company from &#147;Bluegate Corporation&#148; to &#147;Logicquest Technology, Inc.&#148;

&#183;

To increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 from fifty million (50,000,000) to two hundred million (200,000,000) (the &#147;Authorized Increase&#148;); and

&#183;

To perform a reverse stock split of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one post-split share per twenty pre-split shares (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;).

The above actions were effective on March 19, 2015.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOVEMBER 7, 2009 DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND BUSINESS

For the first half of 2014, Logicquest consisted of the networking service (carrier/circuit) business that provided internet connectivity to corporate clients on a subscription basis; essentially operating as a value added provider.

LOGICQUEST STRATEGY

Following the name change and reverse split, we are in active search of some businesses in the high tech industry that will provide good value to shareholders.
