 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS BACKGROUND 

As used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#147;Moody&#146;s&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148; refer to Moody&#146;s Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Company&#146;s executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300. 

THE COMPANY 

Moody&#146;s is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) outsourced research and analytical services to financial institution customers. Moody&#146;s reports in two reportable segments: MIS and MA. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses and operating income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report, and are herein incorporated by reference. 

MIS publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate and governmental obligations, structured finance securities and commercial paper programs. Ratings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. MIS provides ratings in more than 120 countries. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public through a variety of print and electronic media, including the Internet and real-time information systems widely used by securities traders and investors. As of December 31, 2015, MIS had ratings relationships with approximately 11,000 corporate issuers and approximately 20,000 public finance issuers. Additionally, the Company has rated and currently monitors ratings on approximately 68,000 structured finance obligations (representing approximately 12,000 transactions). The aforementioned amounts relating to the number of issuers and transactions represent issuers or transactions that had an active rating at any point during the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA&#146;s non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment. 

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its Research, Data and Analytics business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, commentary on topical credit related events and also provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its Enterprise Risk Solutions business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. Within its Professional Services business it provides outsourced research and analytical services along with financial training and certification programs. MA customers represent more than 4,700 institutions worldwide operating in approximately 140 countries. During 2015 Moody&#146;s research website was accessed by over 259,000 individuals including 34,000 client users. 

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH 

Over recent decades, global fixed-income markets have grown significantly both in terms of the amount and the types of securities or other obligations outstanding. Beginning in mid-2007, there was a severe market disruption and associated financial crisis both in the developed and emerging markets resulting in a global decline in issuance activity for some significant asset classes and weak economic performance in advanced economies. Since this financial crisis, many markets and economies have recovered and Moody&#146;s believes that the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and related financial information market, which includes information such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services. 

&#160;

10 &#160; MOODY&#146;S 2015 10K &#160; Moody&#146;s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including: 

&#160;

&#187; &#160; Health of the world&#146;s major economies; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Debt capital markets activity; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Disintermediation of credit markets; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Fiscal and monetary policy of governments; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Changing regulatory requirements; and &#160;

&#187; &#160; Business investment spending, including acquisitions. Moody&#146;s is well positioned to benefit from a continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and a more informed use of credit ratings as well as research and related analytical products in an environment with heightened attention to credit risk analysis and management. Moody&#146;s expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high-quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services. 

Strong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities. Moody&#146;s key growth drivers include debt market issuance driven by global GDP growth, continued disintermediation of fixed-income markets in both developed and emerging economies that drives issuance and demand for new products and services, growth in MA driven by further penetration into MA&#146;s client base and expansion of bank and insurance risk regulatory requirements, pricing opportunities aligned with value and advances in information technology. 

Growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including interest rates, business investment spending, corporate refinancing needs, merger and acquisition activity, issuer profits, consumer borrowing levels and securitization activity. Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS&#146;s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. MIS&#146;s results can be affected by factors such as the performance and prospects for growth of the major world economies, the fiscal and monetary policies pursued by their governments and the decisions of issuers to request MIS ratings to aid investors in their investment decisions. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MIS&#146;s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets. Furthermore, the strong growth seen in the issuance of structured finance securities from the mid-1990&#146;s reversed dramatically in 2008 due to market turmoil, with continued declines seen in 2009 and 2010, before stabilizing in 2011 with Moody&#146;s experiencing revenue growth in this market beginning in 2012. Despite significant declines from peak market issuance levels, Moody&#146;s believes that structured finance securities will continue to play a role in global fixed-income markets and provide opportunities for longer term revenue growth. 

The pace of change in technology and communication over the past two decades makes information about investment alternatives widely available throughout the world and facilitates issuers&#146; ability to place securities outside their national markets and investors&#146; capacity to obtain information about securities issued outside their national markets. Technology also allows issuers and investors the ability to more readily obtain information about new financing techniques and new types of securities that they may wish to purchase or sell, which in the absence of the appropriate technology may not be readily or easily obtainable. This availability of information promotes the ongoing integration and expansion of financial markets worldwide giving issuers and investors access to a wider range of established and newer capital markets. As technology provides broader access to worldwide markets, it also results in a greater need for credible, globally comparable opinions about credit risk, data, analytics and related services. Additionally, information technology also provides opportunities to further build a global platform to support Moody&#146;s continued expansion in developing markets. 

An ongoing trend in the world&#146;s capital markets is the disintermediation of financial systems. Issuers increasingly raise capital in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or in substitution for, traditional financial intermediaries. Moreover, financial intermediaries have sold assets in the global public capital markets, in addition to, or instead of, retaining those assets. Moody&#146;s believes that debt capital markets offer advantages in capacity and efficiency compared to the traditional banking systems and that the trend of increased disintermediation will continue. Further, disintermediation has continued because of the ongoing low interest rate environment and bank deleveraging, which has encouraged a number of corporations and other entities to seek alternative funding in the bond markets. 

Moody&#146;s also observes disintermediation in key emerging markets where economic growth may outpace internal banking system capacity. Thus, disintermediation is expected to continue over the longer-term, with Moody&#146;s targeting investment and resources to those markets where disintermediation and bond issuance is expected to remain robust. 

&#160;

&#160; MOODY&#146;S 2015 10K &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; In response to the credit market disruptions beginning in mid-2007, ongoing volatility in the global capital markets and new regulatory requirements, financial institutions are investing in people, processes and systems to enhance risk management and compliance functions. Regulations such as the Financial Reform Act, Basel II, Basel III, Solvency II and others may stimulate demand for MA products. Financial institutions are also investing in advanced qualitative and quantitative tools and services to support their management of complex balance sheets and diverse portfolios as well as operating costs. MA offers a suite of risk management products and services to address these needs, including but not limited to risk management software, economic analysis, training and professional services. 

Legislative bodies and regulators in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions continue to conduct regulatory reviews of CRAs, which may result in, for example, an increased number of competitors, changes to the business model or restrictions on certain business activities of MIS, removal of references to ratings in certain regulations, or increased costs of doing business for MIS. Therefore, in order to broaden the potential for expansion of non-ratings services, Moody&#146;s reorganized in January 2008 into two distinct businesses: MIS, consisting primarily of the ratings business, and MA, which conducts activities including the sale of credit research produced by MIS and the production and sale of other economic and credit-related products and services. The reorganization broadens the opportunities for expansion by MA into activities that may have otherwise been restricted for MIS, due to the potential for conflicts of interest with the ratings business. At present, Moody&#146;s is unable to assess the nature and effect that any regulatory changes may have on future growth opportunities. 

Moody&#146;s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; inherent in conducting business on a global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions. 

COMPETITION 

MIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS&#146;s ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities. MIS&#146;s largest competitor in the global credit rating business is Standard &#38; Poor&#146;s Ratings Services (S&#38;P), a division of McGraw Hill Financial. There are some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody&#146;s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to S&#38;P, while in other markets, the reverse is true. 

In addition to S&#38;P, MIS&#146;s competitors include Fitch Ratings, Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best Company, Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd., Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc., Morningstar Inc. and Egan-Jones Ratings Company. In Europe, there are approximately 30 companies currently registered with ESMA, which include both purely domestic European CRAs and International CRAs such as S&#38;P, Fitch and DBRS. There are additional competitors in other regions and countries, for example, in China, where Moody&#146;s participates through a joint venture. These competitors include China Lianhe Credit Rating Co Ltd., Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating &#38; Investors Service Co Ltd., Dagong Global Credit Rating Co Ltd. and Pengyuan Credit Rating Co Ltd. 

MA competes broadly in the financial information industry against diversified competitors such as Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, S&#38;P Capital IQ, Fitch Solutions, Dun &#38; Bradstreet, IBM, Wolters Kluwer, Sungard, SAS, Fiserv, MSCI and Markit Group among others. MA&#146;s main competitors within RD&#38;A include S&#38;P Capital IQ, CreditSights, Thomson Reuters, Intex, IHS Global Insight, BlackRock Solutions, FactSet and other providers of fixed income analytics, valuations, economic data and research. In ERS, MA faces competition from both large software providers such as IBM Algorithmics, SunGard, SAS, Oracle, Misys, Oliver Wyman, Verisk and various other vendors and in-house solutions. Within Professional Services, MA competes with Omega Performance, DC Gardner, and a host of financial training and education firms, and with Evalueserve, CRISIL Global Research &#38; Analytics, and other providers of outsourced research and professional services, respectively. 

MOODY&#146;S STRATEGY 

Moody&#146;s corporate strategy is to be the world&#146;s most respected authority serving financial risk-sensitive markets. The key aspects to implement this strategy are to: 

&#160;

&#187; &#160; Defend and enhance the core ratings and research business of MIS; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Build MA&#146;s position as a leading provider of risk management solutions to financial institutions; and &#160;

&#187; &#160; Invest in strategic growth opportunities. &#160;

12 &#160; MOODY&#146;S 2015 10K &#160; Moody&#146;s will make investments to defend and enhance its core businesses in an attempt to position the Company to fully capture market opportunities resulting from global debt capital market expansion and increased business investment spending. Moody&#146;s will also make strategic investments to achieve scale in attractive financial information markets, move into attractive product and service adjacencies where the Company can leverage its brand, extend its thought leadership and expand its geographic presence in high growth emerging markets. 

To broaden the Company&#146;s potential, MA provides a wide range of products and services to enable financial institutions to better manage risk. As such, MA adds to the Company&#146;s value proposition in three ways. First, MA&#146;s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to offset cyclicality in ratings issuance volumes that may result in volatility to MIS&#146;s revenues. Second, MA products and services, such as financial training and professional services on research and risk management best practices, provide opportunities for entry into emerging markets before debt capital markets fully develop and thus present long-term growth opportunities for the ratings business. Finally, MA&#146;s integrated risk management software platform embeds Moody&#146;s solutions deep into the technology infrastructure of banks and insurance companies worldwide. 

Moody&#146;s invests in initiatives to implement the Company&#146;s strategy, including internally-led organic development and targeted acquisitions. Example initiatives include: 

&#160;

&#187; &#160; Enhancements to ratings quality and product extensions; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Investments that extend ownership and participation in joint ventures and strategic alliances; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Headcount growth to meet customer demand for new products and services; &#160;

&#187; &#160; Selective, bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate the ability to scale and grow Moody&#146;s businesses; and &#160;

&#187; &#160; Expansion in emerging markets. During 2015, Moody&#146;s continued to acquire complementary businesses in MIS and MA. In May 2015, Moody&#146;s acquired Equilibrium, a leading provider of credit rating and research services in Peru and other countries in Latin America. In December 2015, Moody&#146;s acquired the residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) data and analytics assets of BlackBox Logic. Moody&#146;s will integrate BlackBox Logic&#146;s loan-level RMBS data and technologies into products of its Structured Analytics and Valuations unit within the RD&#38;A LOB in MA. 

REGULATION 

MIS and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Thus, existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company&#146;s operations and the markets for securities that it rates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may negatively impact Moody&#146;s operations or profitability, the Company&#146;s ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings, in the manner in which ratings are utilized and in the manner in which Moody&#146;s operates. 

The regulatory landscape has changed rapidly in recent years, and continues to evolve. In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework. The European Securities and Markets Authority has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered CRA industry throughout the EU. MIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic inspection. Applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed, reporting requirements to ESMA regarding fees, and additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services. 

Separately, CRA3 also requires that ESMA and / or the European Commission produce several reports on the industry&#146;s structure and the use of ratings. In October 2015, ESMA published its reports, wherein it acknowledged the impact of regulation on the industry, and stated that it will continue to monitor the industry structure over the next three to five years. The European Commission is expected to publish its reports during the first half of 2016. 

In the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the Reform Act and the Financial Reform Act. The SEC is required by these legislative acts to publish two annual reports to Congress on NRSROs. The Financial Reform Act requires the SEC to examine each NRSRO once a year and issue an annual report summarizing the examination findings, among other requirements. The annual report required by the Reform Act details the SEC&#146;s views on the state of competition, transparency and conflicts of interests among NRSROs, among other requirements. The SEC voted in August 2014 to adopt its final rules for NRSROs as required by the Financial Reform Act. The Company has made and continues to make substantial IT and other investments, and has implemented the relevant compliance obligations. 

&#160;

&#160; MOODY&#146;S 2015 10K &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; In light of the regulations that have gone into effect in both the EU and the U.S. (as well as many other countries), from time to time and as a matter of course pursuant to their enabling legislation these regulatory authorities have and will continue to publish reports that describe their oversight activities over the industry. In addition, other legislation and/or interpretation of existing regulation relating to credit rating and research services is being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and this type of activity is likely to continue in the future. Finally, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. If enacted, any such legislation and regulation could change the competitive landscape in which MIS operates. The legal status of rating agencies has been addressed by courts in various decisions and is likely to be considered and addressed in legal proceedings from time to time in the future. Management of the Company cannot predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted, the outcome of any pending or possible future legal proceedings, or regulatory or legislative actions, or the ultimate impact of any such matters on the competitive position, financial position or results of operations of Moody&#146;s.
