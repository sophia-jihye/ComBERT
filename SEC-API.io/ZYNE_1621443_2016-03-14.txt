Company Overview 

&#160; 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary next &#8209;generation synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics formulated for transdermal delivery. We are evaluating two patent &#8209;protected product candidates, ZYN002 and ZYN001, in five indications. We intend to study ZYN002 in patients with refractory epilepsy, osteoarthritis , or OA , and Fragile X syndrome , or FXS. We intend to study ZYN001 in patients with fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. We believe these product candidates will provide new treatment options for patients, as well as additional treatment options for patients not currently receiving adequate relief from current treatment regimens. We initiated Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN002 in October 2015 and expect to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials for ZYN002 in the second half of 2016. We expect to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN001 in the second half of 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 

Cannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from Cannabis plants. The two primary cannabinoids contained in Cannabis are cannabidiol , or CBD , and &#916;9 &#8209;tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has positive effects on treating refractory epilepsy, arthritis and FXS , and THC has positive effects on treating pain. In addition to ZYN002 and ZYN001 potentially offering first &#8209;line therapies to patients suffering from OA, FXS, fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain, we believe ZYN002 may provide a complementary treatment for patients suffering from epilepsy who are refractory to their current treatment regimens. 

&#160; 

We believe that we offer an attractive alternative to existing cannabinoid therapies by synthetically manufacturing and transdermally delivering our product candidates. Most cannabinoid therapies have drawbacks and limitations due to their botanical (plant &#8209;derived) nature, as well as the fact that they are administered orally. Botanical cannabinoids create significant challenges for drug manufacturers because of the natural resources and security measures required to grow Cannabis , as well as the strict batch controls required by regulatory agencies in pharmaceutical manufacturing. In addition, we believe all currently approved and development &#8209;stage cannabinoid therapeutics, except ZYN002 and ZYN001, are designed to be administered orally which can lead to limitations in safety and efficacy including low bioavailability, inconsistent plasma levels, degradation by stomach acids, and significant first &#8209;pass liver metabolism. First &#8209;pass liver metabolism refers to the process by which the liver breaks down therapeutics ingested directly or indirectly through the gastrointestinal system, such as through oral or oral mucosal delivery methods, allowing only a small amount of drug to be absorbed into the circulatory system. In contrast, transdermal therapeutics are absorbed through the skin directly into the systemic circulation, avoiding first &#8209;pass liver metabolism and degradation by stomach acids, and potentially enabling lower dosage levels of active pharmaceutical ingredients and rapid and reliable absorption with high bioavailability, fewer negative psychoactive effects and fewer drug &#8209;drug interactions. 

&#160; 

ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a permeation &#8209;enhanced gel for transdermal delivery, and is patent &#8209;protected through 2030. CBD is the primary non &#8209;psychoactive component of Cannabis . In preclinical animal studies, ZYN002&#8217;s permeation enhancer increased delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first &#8209;pass liver metabolism. In addition, an in vitro study performed by us demonstrated that CBD is degraded to THC in an acidic environment such as the stomach. We believe such degradation may lead to increased psychoactive effects and may be avoided or minimized with the transdermal delivery of ZYN002, which maintains CBD in a neutral pH. ZYN002, which is being developed as a clear gel with once- or twice-daily dosing, is targeting treatment of refractory epilepsy, OA and FXS , which collectively affect millions of patients using treatments that currently comprise a multi &#8209;billion dollar market. W e have been granted orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA , &#160; for ZYN002 for the treatment of FXS . 

&#160; 

ZYN001 is a pro &#8209;drug of THC that enables effective transdermal delivery via a patch and is patent &#8209;protected through 2031. A pro &#8209;drug is a drug administered in an inactive or less active form and designed to enable more effective delivery, which is then converted into an active form through a normal metabolic process. In addition, we expect that ZYN001 will be classified by the FDA as a new chemical entity , or NCE. In our preclinical animal studies, ZYN001 demonstrated effective skin permeation with sustained delivery and rapid conversion of ZYN001 to THC. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first &#8209;pass liver metabolism. In addition, preclinical testing conducted has shown no genotoxicity findings and 

&#160;

safety pharmacology findings consistent with those seen with THC . ZYN001 is targeting two pain indications , fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in healthy human subjects (and in patients with refractory epilepsy) to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of ZYN002. Initial results from this trial indicate the ZYN002 was safe and well-tolerated at all tested dose levels. In January 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 multiple rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in healthy volunteers (and patients with epilepsy) to examine the tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics, or PD, of multiple doses of ZYN002. 

&#160; 

We plan to evaluate the tolerability and PK profile of ZYN001 in Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trials in healthy human subjects in the second half of 2016. Subsequent to the single rising dose clinical trials, we intend to conduct Phase 1 multiple rising dose clinical trials to examine the tolerability, PK and PD of multiple doses of ZYN001 in healthy human subjects and in patients with fibromyalgia. To complete the Phase 1 program for both product candidates, we will conduct bioequivalence clinical trials assessing the PK when applied to various parts of the body (e.g., arm, thigh and back). 

&#160; 

Following the Phase 1 clinical trials, we intend to initiate a Phase 2a randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of ZYN002 to placebo in refractory epilepsy and OA. We intend to initiate an open label Phase 2a clinical trial in FXS to evaluate efficacy and safety. We also intend to initiate a Phase 2a randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of ZYN001 to placebo in fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. 

&#160;

Cannabinoid Science Overview 

&#160; 

Cannabinoids refer to a unique class of compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. Of the over 70 cannabinoid compounds currently identified, THC and CBD are the primary cannabinoids used for pharmaceutical purposes. THC was identified as the major psychoactive cannabinoid and subsequently found to be a partial agonist of the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors, activation of which stimulates the endogenous noradrenergic pathway, inducing antinociception and suggesting a role for THC in pain management. 

&#160; 

CBD, the main non &#8209;psychoactive component of Cannabis , has little affinity for the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. It does, however, produce multiple effects, including blocking the equilibrative nucleoside transporter, the orphan G &#8209;protein &#8209;coupled receptor GRP55, and the transient receptor potential of melastatin type 8 channel; enhancing activity of 5 &#8209;HT 1a and glycine receptors and the transient receptor potential of ankyrin type 1 channel; and regulating the intracellular effects of calcium. The influence of CBD on these targets &#8212; each of which we believe plays a key role in neuronal excitability &#8212; is the scientific basis for its antiepileptic potential. 

&#160; 

CBD inhibits the metabolism (breakdown) of two endocannabinoids ( anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or 2-AG) . Inhibition of the metabolism of these endocannabinoids is thought to result in increased anandamide and 2-AG availability and greater CB 1 &#160; and CB 2 &#160; activation. Therefore, CBD acts as a facilitator of the endogenous endocannabinoid system, which modifies release of other neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals. This modulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons of various classes is the scientific basis for the use of CBD in the treatment of FXS. 

&#160; 

CBD exerts a range of anti &#8209;inflammatory effects, including attenuation of the endothelial cell activation, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, suppression of T &#8209;cell macrophage reactivity, and induction of apoptosis of T cells, which suggests a possible therapeutic role in the treatment of OA. CBD&#8217;s agonist effect on TRPV1 receptors leads to antihyperalgesia, which further suggests a possible role in the treatment of OA. Third &#8209;party studies suggest that psychotropic effects of Cannabis are caused by THC, not CBD. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Clinical and preclinical data suggest that THC has positive effects on treating pain and CBD has positive effects on treating epilepsy, arthritis and FXS . Clinical data suggest that THC and CBD have a very high therapeutic index. Interest in cannabinoid therapeutics has increased significantly over the past several years as preclinical and clinical data has emerged highlighting the potential efficacy and safety benefits of cannabinoid therapeutics. Dronabinol and nabilone, oral formulations of THC, have been approved by the FDA. In third &#8209;party studies, adverse events from oral THC including dronabinol and nabilone were primarily psychotropic and related to peak plasma levels. Many patients have received CBD &#8209;enriched Cannabis and Epidiolex &#174; , a liquid formulation of highly concentrated CBD which is currently in development. The cannabinoid therapeutics market is expected to grow significantly due to the potential benefits these products may provide over existing therapies. For example, opioids are often the standard of care for treating various pain diseases but patients frequently experience adverse side effects, including addiction and opioid &#8209;induced constipation. 

&#160; 

Our Product Candidates 

&#160; 

ZYN002 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a patent &#8209;protected permeation &#8209;enhanced gel for transdermal delivery (see Figure 1). 

&#160; 

Figure 1 &#8212; Chemical structure and delivery of CBD. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ZYN00 2 is being developed as a clear gel that is designed to provide consistent, controlled drug delivery with convenient once &#8209; or twice &#8209;daily dosing. Because CBD is virtually insoluble in water, we use ethanol and propylene glycol as solubilizing agents and Transcutol &#174; HP as a permeation enhancer. All excipients in the gel have been classified as Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS , and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The permeation enhancer in ZYN002 increases the delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system. 

&#160; 

Transdermal delivery allows the CBD in ZYN002 to avoid stomach acid degradation and the first &#8209;pass liver metabolism that occurs with oral or oral mucosal delivery methods. Drugs applied transdermally are absorbed across the skin directly into the systemic circulation, enabling the potential to have rapid and reliable absorption with high bioavailability. 

&#160; 

Market Overview and Rationale 

&#160; 

We intend to study ZYN002 in the treatment of refractory epilepsy, OA and FXS . 

&#160; 

Epilepsy &#8212; Epilepsy is a disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures (transient symptoms due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain) and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the condition. Partial seizures usually start in a small area of the temporal lobe or frontal lobe of the brain and quickly involve other areas of the brain that affect alertness and awareness. Partial seizures are the most common type of seizure, representing 35% of all epilepsies. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

According to Decision Resources, in 2012 there were approximately 2.2 million epilepsy patients in the United States, and treatments for these patients represented a total U.S. market size of approximately $1.7 billion. &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy based on the anticonvulsant effects of CBD due to its ability to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability shown in multiple in vivo models of epilepsy conducted by third parties. Epilepsy specialists and patient organizations have shown considerable interest in the potential therapeutic role of CBD in adults with epilepsy and, especially, children with intractable epilepsy. Two companies have active CBD development programs for the treatment of patients with Dravet&#8217;s syndrome, or DS, or Lennox Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, both of which are rare and severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Unlike these cannabinoid &#8209;based epilepsy development programs, we are conducting development programs for ZYN002 in a much broader subset of the epilepsy population. 

&#160; 

No large &#8209;scale, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trials of CBD for the treatment of patients with epilepsy (either pediatric or adult) have been published. However, in a small (fifteen patients), third &#8209;party Phase 2 clinical trial, patients with a documented history of epilepsy were treated with crystalline CBD or placebo for up to 4.5 months. A total of 88% of the CBD &#8209;treated group had a response to treatment, with 50% of patients experiencing considerable improvement and 38% reporting at least partial improvement. In a compassionate access study conducted by a third party, 162 patients with treatment resistant epilepsy were treated for at least 12 weeks with an oral CBD solution. In this open label study, 50% of patients with DS had a 50% reduction in seizures compared to baseline while 69% of patients with LGS had a 50% reduction in seizures compared to baseline. Our expected type of therapy is adjunctive, second-line therapy in patients with partial seizures with secondary generalization on a stable dose of an anticonvulsant with a history of failure. 

&#160; 

Osteoarthritis &#8212; OA is a degenerative joint disease that leads to wear and tear of the joints and affects the cartilage, joint lining, ligaments and bone. It is the most common form of joint disease and tends to occur most often in the hand joints, spine, hip, knees and great toes. It is characterized by the breakdown of the joint cartilage, bony changes in the joints and deterioration of the tendons and ligaments leading to pain and inflammation of the joint lining. &#160; 

&#160; 

According to Decision Resources, which defines OA as radiographically confirmed OA of any joint, in 2008 it was predicted that the total number of prevalent cases of OA would be approximately 129.5 million by 2012. Treatment for patients suffering from OA represented a total U.S. market size of approximately $670.0 million in 2012. 

&#160; 

We believe that ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for OA based on research we have conducted. We examined the efficacy of transdermal ZYN002 for reduction of inflammation and pain in vivo , assessing adverse effects in a rat with complete Freund&#8217;s adjuvant &#8209;induced monoarthritic knee. ZYN002 gel (0.6, 3.1, 6.2, or 62.3 mg/day) was applied for four consecutive days after arthritis induction. The level of inflammation was assessed by knee joint circumference and immune cell invasion in histological sections. 

&#160; 

Measurement of CBD plasma concentration revealed linearity with daily doses of 0.6 to 6.2 mg of ZYN002. Compared with baseline, rats treated with ZYN002 gel had significant, dose &#8209;dependent reductions in knee joint and synovial membrane swelling, immune cell infiltration, and spontaneous pain rating scores ( P &#8804;0.05). Paw withdrawal latency, or PWL, recovered to near &#8209;baseline levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia revealed dose &#8209;dependent reductions of pro &#8209;inflammatory biomarkers (CD11b/c, CGRP, TNF). The data suggests that topical ZYN002 has the potential to provide effective relief of pain and inflammation caused by OA. Our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first-line therapy in patients with OA. 

&#160; 

FXS &#8212; FXS is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, anxiety disorders, behavioral and learning challenges and various physical characteristics. The impairment can range from learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. According to the National Fragile X Foundation, FXS affects 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females of all races and ethnic groups. Approximately 1 in 151 women carry the Fragile X gene and could pass it to their children. Approximately 1 in 468 men carry the Fragile X gene and their daughters will also be carriers. FXS is an autism spectrum disorder, and patients with FXS exhibit autism &#8209;like symptoms including cognitive impairment, anxiety and mood swings, attention deficit and heightened stimuli. Approximately 7% of women and 18% of men with FXS have seizures. People with FXS are affected throughout their lives. Currently, there are no known cures or approved therapies for the treatment of FXS. Special education and symptomatic treatments for anxiety and irritability are employed to lessen the burden of illness. &#160; 

&#160; 

FXS is the most common inherited intellectual disability. Based on the 2012 U.S. Census and FXS prevalence rates according to the National Fragile X Foundation, in 2012 there were approximately 71,000 patients with FXS in the United States. 

&#160; 

We believe ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for FXS based on its capacity to interact with the endocannabinoid system, which is compromised in patients with FXS. Specifically, CBD indirectly increases the concentration of the cannabinoids 2 &#8209;AG and 

&#160;

anandamide, which are endogenous ligands at the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. Furthermore, the Fragile X mental retardation protein 1 that is diminished in patients with FXS, is required for the production of 2 &#8209;AG. Therefore, FXS results in the reduction of endogenous stimulation of endocannabinoid receptors while CBD facilitates the availability of endogenous endocannabinoids, potentially attenuating the pathophysiology of the disease. Our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first-line therapy in patients with FXS. 

&#160; 

In vitro and Preclinical Studies 

&#160; 

In an in vitro study, we evaluated the effects of exposing CBD to acidic conditions. We exposed CBD to simulated gastric fluid . Upon high &#8209;performance liquid chromatography analysis of this solution, we found &#916; &#8209;8 THC and &#916; &#8209;9 THC compounds formed from the degradation of CBD in this acidic condition. These results suggest that CBD may degrade and form THC if delivered by oral or oral mucosal routes. 

&#160; 

The PK of ZYN002 has been studied in three animal species: guinea pigs, Sprague &#8209;Dawley, or SD, rats and squirrel monkeys. PK refers to a drug&#8217;s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion from the body and measures, among other things, the concentration of the drug in the plasma. Based upon preclinical studies, the transdermal route of administration of ZYN002 achieves sustained, consistent CBD plasma levels. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

We have completed an extensive review of the literature related to preclinical toxicology of CBD and completed a mutagenicity study with ZYN002. This preclinical toxicology analysis was provided to the FDA for a pre &#8209; Investigational New Drug, or IND, meeting held in the first quarter of 2015 and, the FDA confirmed that no further preclinical work would be required prior to the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical program. We initiated Phase 1 clinical trials in Australia in October 2015, and we expect to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials in each indication in the second half of 2016. We have initiated a standard toxicology program for ZYN002 concurrently with the clinical program. The toxicology program will consist of standard single &#8209;dose toxicology, multiple &#8209;dose toxicology, reproductive studies and carcinogenicity studies. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Clinical Trials&#8212; In October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trial of ZYN002. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of ZYN002 in 32 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with epilepsy. Initial results from the 32 healthy volunteers demonstrated that ZYN002 was safe and well tolerated at all four dose levels. There were no serious adverse events, no drug-related changes in ECGs or clinical laboratory values, and there were no discontinuations due to adverse events. Overall, the incidence of adverse events associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo. In addition, ZYN002 demonstrated no impairment in the trail making test, a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching, which detects several cognitive impairments. Final results, including results from patients with epilepsy, are expected in the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

In January 2016 we initiated a second Phase 1 clinical trial for ZYN002. The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, titled the &#8220;Multiple Rising Dose Study in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Epilepsy,&#8221; will evaluate the PK profile and tolerability of ZYN002 in 24 healthy volunteers, followed by 12 patients with epilepsy. Results are expected in the first half of 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 

To complete the Phase 1 program, we will conduct a bioequivalence clinical trial assessing the PK of ZYN002 when applied to various parts of the body (e.g., arm, thigh and back). 

&#160; 

&#160;

Phase 2a Clinical Trials&#8212; We intend to initiate Phase 2a clinical trials for ZYN002 as outlined in the following table: &#160;

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials &#8212; We intend to use the data from the Phase 2 clinical trials outlined above to select doses of ZYN002 for our Phase 3 program, which will consist of two randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trials for each indication and open &#8209;label long &#8209;term clinical trials. 

&#160; 

ZYN001 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

ZYN001 is a pro-drug of THC that enables effective transdermal delivery via a patch and is patent protected through 2031. We expect that ZYN001 will be classified by the FDA as an NCE. The structure of the skin effectively inhibit the transdermal delivery of most therapeutics. Drugs classified as hydrophobic, such as THC, add an additional impediment to their transdermal delivery through the skin. THC is naturally hydrophobic and thus is unable to be effectively delivered through human skin. A pro &#8209;drug is a drug administered in an inactive or less active form and designed to enable more effective delivery, and then converted into an active form through a normal metabolic process. Chemically, ZYN001 is the synthetic D &#8209;glyceric acid ester of THC. Unlike THC, ZYN001 is able to be efficiently absorbed into the skin through transdermal delivery. After crossing the stratum corneum, ZYN001 is hydrolyzed back to THC and glyceric acid under physiological conditions, mainly due to the action of common enzymes in the skin tissue known as &#8220;esterases.&#8221; See Figure 2 below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Figure 2. Hydrolysis of ZYN001 into glyceric acid and THC. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The transdermal patch is a non-invasive, non-oral dosage form that has been proven to be an effective method of delivery in other U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved products. The ZYN001 transdermal patch contains a 4% ZYN001 gel formulation. We intend to test the ZYN001 patch for application to the arm, back and thigh. The drug substance is produced synthetically and is not derived or extracted from botanicals. The excipients in the patch have been classified as GRAS, and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA. 

&#160; 

As illustrated below in Figure 3, transdermal delivery often provides more consistent plasma levels without the peaks and valleys often associated with an oral dosage form. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Market Overview and Rationale 

&#160; 

We intend to study ZYN001 for the treatment of fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. 

&#160; 

Fibromyalgia &#8212; Fibromyalgia is a chronic health problem that causes pain throughout the body and other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive (memory or thought) problems. According to Decision Resources, in 2012, there were approximately 5.6 million adult fibromyalgia patients in the United States, and pain treatment for these patients represented a total U.S. market size of approximately $1.6 billion. 

&#160; 

We believe that ZYN001 may provide an effective treatment for fibromyalgia based on the hypothesis that an endocannabinoid deficiency is the underlying cause of fibromyalgia, which may enable patients to benefit from therapy with an exogenous cannabinoid. Nabilone, a compound which is chemically similar but not identical to THC, has shown significant reduction in fibromyalgia pain in a third &#8209;party randomized clinical trial, but it has also been associated with dose limiting psychoactive adverse effects. We believe ZYN001 has the potential to treat fibromyalgia by delivering sustained, consistent plasma levels of THC to provide a therapeutic benefit with minimal psychoactive adverse effects. Our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first-line therapy in patients with fibromyalgia. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Peripheral Neuropathic Pain &#8212; Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous systems. In patients with peripheral neuropathic pain, the pain is a symptom of another disease that has caused nerve damage &#8212; such as a herniated disc (lower back pain), diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), cancer (neuropathic cancer pain), or herpes zoster infection (postherpetic neuralgia) &#8212; but it is recognized as a clinical condition on its own. Because the damage does not involve the brain or spinal cord, the resulting neuropathic pain is defined as peripheral. 

&#160; 

According to Decision Resources, in 2012 there were approximately 14.0 million peripheral neuropathic pain patients in the United States, and pain treatment for these patients represented a total U.S. market size of approximately $4.0 billion in 2012. 

&#160; 

We believe that ZYN001 may provide effective treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain based on third &#8209;party studies in animals that have shown that cannabinoid receptors are found in high concentrations in the central nervous system, as well as on peripheral neurons and along the principal nociceptive pathways. The results of a third &#8209;party randomized, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trial demonstrated that low &#8209;dose vaporized Cannabis may reduce neuropathic pain which we believe suggests a role for THC in peripheral neuropathic pain management. Our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first-line therapy in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies 

&#160; 

In preclinical studies, the transdermal route of administration of ZYN001 achieved consistent THC plasma levels that we believe will deliver therapeutic benefit with minimal psychoactive side effects thereby distinguishing it from oral and oral mucosal delivery systems. 

&#160; 

In vivo guinea pig PK &#8212; The PK of a 4% ZYN001 patch was examined in a hairless guinea pig model by adhering two patches, with a total of 6.25 cm 2 active area, to the guinea pig. PK refers to a drug&#8217;s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion from the body and measures, among other things, the concentration of the drug in the plasma. The patches remained on the guinea pig for 72 hours, and blood samples were obtained for 103 hours. Plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography &#8209;tandem mass spectrometry, or LC/MSMS. ZYN001, THC, and metabolites of THC (hydroxy &#8209;THC, or THC &#8209;OH, and 11 &#8209;nor &#8209;delta &#8209;9 &#8209;THC carboxylic acid, or TCH &#8209;COOH), were measured. No skin irritation or erythema was shown. Results of this study are reflected in Figure 4 below. 

&#160; 

Figure 4. Plasma concentration vs time in guinea pig after ZYN001 patch application. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ZYN001 achieved a steady &#8209;state plasma concentration of total THC equivalents of 6.90 &#177; 1.47 ng/mL. These results demonstrate that ZYN001 was rapidly converted to THC and sustained, consistent plasma levels of THC were achieved. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

The standard battery of genotoxicology studies required by the FDA for ZYN001 showed no adverse effects. The safety pharmacology studies required by the FDA demonstrated that ZYN001 has a pharmacology profile consistent with THC. The compound is currently being investigated in preclinical toxicology. We discussed our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials for 

&#160;

ZYN001 with the FDA at a Pre &#8209;IND meeting in August 2013. We anticipate initiating Phase 1 clinical trials beginning in the second half of 2016. Phase 2 clinical trials investigating ZYN001 in each individual indication are planned to begin in the first half of 2017. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 Clinical Trials&#8212; We plan to evaluate the tolerability and PK profile of ZYN001 in a Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trial in healthy human subjects. Subsequent to the single rising dose clinical trial, we intend to conduct a Phase 1 multiple rising dose clinical trials to examine the tolerability, PK and PD of multiple doses of ZYN001 in healthy human subjects and in patients with fibromyalgia. To complete the Phase 1 program, we will conduct a bioequivalence clinical trial assessing the PK of ZYN001 when applied to various parts of the body (e.g., arm, thigh and back). 

&#160; 

Phase 2a Clinical Trials&#8212; We intend to initiate Phase 2a clinical trials for ZYN001 as outlined in the following table: &#160;

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials &#8212; We intend to use the data from the Phase 2 clinical trials outlined above to select doses of ZYN001 for our Phase 3 program, which will consist of two randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trials for each indication and open &#8209;label long &#8209;term clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The success of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary compounds, technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 

&#160; 

We internally developed our intellectual property related to ZYN002 and ZYN001. We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries. 

&#160; 

As of March 10 , 2016, we owned a total of seven issued U.S. utility patents and two pending U.S. utility patent applications. These U.S. patents and patent applications will expire between 2029 through 2031. We have already obtained additional patent term for 

&#160;

some of the issued patents to compensate us for delays at the U.S. Patent Office, under the patent term adjustment laws. These patents, and any pending applications that ultimately issue as patents, may also be eligible for patent term extension for delay caused by FDA regulatory review, thereby further extending their patent terms. 

&#160; 

In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we own 85 corresponding foreign issued patents and 8 corresponding foreign applications, which will expire between 2026 and 2031. 

&#160; 

ZYN002 

&#160; 

Our ZYN002 patent portfolio currently consists of two issued patents in the United States, six issued patents in France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and one pending patent application in Canada. The issued patents claim the permeation enhanced formulation of ZYN002 and methods of use relating to ZYN002. The issued patents will expire between 2026 and 20 30 . Any patents that issue from our currently pending patent applications will expire in 2030. 

&#160; 

ZYN001 

&#160; 

Our ZYN001 patent portfolio currently consists of two issued patents in the United States, one issued patent in Japan, issued patent s in 43 countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan. The issued patents are composition of matter patents , which cover the chemical structure of the pro &#8209;drug ZYN001, the D &#8209;glyceric acid ester of THC, and other THC pro &#8209;drugs. The issued patents will expire between 2028 and 2031. Any patents that issue from our currently pending patent applications will expire in 2028. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

The rest of our patent portfolio relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to other potential product candidates. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information 

&#160; 

We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know &#8209;how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We incurred research and development expense of $7. 4 million, $2.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs , used in ZYN002 and ZYN001 are synthesized by contract manufacturers. These contract manufacturers have sufficient capabilities to meet our projected product requirements through Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

The ZYN002 gel is manufactured and filled into single unit tubes by a contract manufacturer. The ZYN001 transdermal patch is manufactured by contract manufacturers and sub &#8209;component fabricators. The patch is manufactured by a contract manufacturer. The drug product formulation is manufactured and filled into the patch by another contract manufacturer. 

&#160; 

We selected our contract manufacturers and sub &#8209;component fabricators for their specific competencies in manufacturing, product design, and materials. FDA regulations require that products be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Our key suppliers currently meet cGMPs and have sufficient capacities to meet our projected product requirements through Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Commercial Operations 

&#160; 

We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co &#8209;promotion agreements with strategic collaborators for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that ZYN002 or ZYN001 will be approved. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies; academic institutions; governmental agencies; and public and private research institutions. Successfully developed and commercialized product candidates must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with agents that may become available in the future. 

&#160; 

ZYN002 

&#160; 

We are studying ZYN002, our proprietary synthetic CBD product candidate, as an adjunctive, second &#8209;line therapy in refractory epilepsy patients who are not well controlled by their current anti &#8209;epileptic drug, or AED. We also intend to study ZYN002 in a clinical development program as monotherapy first &#8209;line treatment in patients with OA and FXS . 

&#160; 

Cannabinoid Competition 

&#160; 

Cannabinoids, such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC, or GW&#8217;s Epidiolex &#174; and CBD more generally, have shown promise clinically and anecdotally as a treatment for epilepsy. No CBD products or combination THC/CBD products have been approved in the United States. GW is currently investigating Epidiolex, a liquid formulation of highly concentrated CBD, in the United States for the treatment of DS, (severe, infantile &#8209;onset, genetic drug &#8209;resistant epilepsy with no FDA approved treatments) and LGS (a rare disorder with onset typically between three and five years of age featuring multiple seizure types with slow spike wave complexes on EEG) and childhood epilepsy syndromes. Insys Therapeutics Inc., or Insys, is also developing a synthetic CBD compound for the treatment of DS, LGS, childhood epilepsy syndromes and glioblastoma. 

&#160; 

In the combination THC/CBD space, GW&#8217;s Sativex &#174; , a plant extract combination of THC/CBD for treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, is approved in 27 countries outside the United States as an alternative to baclofen and tizanidine. 

&#160; 

Additional activity in this space includes companies supplying synthetic cannabinoids, Cannabis extracts, and herbal Cannabis to researchers for preclinical and clinical investigation. 

&#160; 

General Competition and Standard of Care 

&#160; 

Within epilepsy, we intend to treat refractory patients who have not responded to previous treatment with AEDs such as depakote, pregabalin, gabapentin, topiramate, and lacosamide. Second and third generation AEDs continue to improve upon first generation therapies, but experts contend that a better understanding of the disorder accompanied by fundamentally innovative treatments will be required to effectively improve treatment outcomes for the high percentage of patients undertreated by AEDs. The majority of AEDs have frequent safety concerns including serious CNS adverse events and drug &#8209;drug interactions. 

&#160; 

In OA, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first &#8209;lin e therapy in patients with OA. P atients try a multitude of prescription and over &#8209;the &#8209;counter medications to relieve pain including traditional NSAIDs, Cox &#8209;2 inhibitors, centrally acting analgesics, topical analgesics, intra &#8209;articular corticosteroids, and hyaluronic acid preparations. Though these products offer varying degrees of pain relief, many also have been shown to cause significant adverse effects including potential addiction. 

&#160; 

In FXS, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first &#8209;line therapy in patients with FXS. There are no drugs approved for the treatment of FXS, although various classes of medications are used off &#8209;label for the treatment of behavioral and mental health conditions associated with FXS. Some patients with FXS benefit from medications that treat attention deficit disorders and other 

&#160;

patients who experience general anxiety, social anxiety and other chronic conditions may benefit from different types of anti &#8209;anxiety medications. We are aware that Neuren Pharmaceuticals and Marinus Pharmaceuticals are developing compounds for the treatment of FXS. 

&#160; 

ZYN001 

&#160; 

We intend to study ZYN001 in a clinical development program as monotherapy, first-line treatment in patients with fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. 

&#160; 

Cannabinoid Competition 

&#160; 

We believe cannabinoids offer a superior treatment paradigm for patients suffering from pain, providing more controlled delivery and therefore treatment effect along with a much more tolerable safety profile. The Cannabis therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant and synthetic products, all of which use THC, CBD, or a combination of THC/CBD as the active ingredient. In the United States, two oral capsules &#8212; Insys&#8217; dronabinol (a synthetic THC) and Meda AB&#8217;s nabilone (a synthetic derivative of THC) &#8212; have been approved and distributed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have not responded adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Dronabinol capsules are also approved for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Insys is also seeking FDA approval for an orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol for treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Exploratory research into the effects of THC formulations in other indications is also in progress. GW, is also developing Sativex &#174; , a plant extract combination of THC/CBD for treatment of chronic cancer pain and neuropathic pain in an oral mucosal spray. 

&#160; 

General Competition and Standard of Care 

&#160; 

In fibromyalgia, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first &#8209;line therapy in patients with fibromyalgia. There are only three drugs approved by the FDA: p regabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran. We intend to treat patients whose condition is either newly diagnosed or has not responded to previous treatment with these three currently approved treatments. There is no known cure for the disease and no single therapy is likely to provide significant relief of all symptoms. Low &#8209;dose tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed frequently, but are associated with various side &#8209;effects. Fibromyalgia is also treated using opioids, but, in addition to debate about their efficacy, these can be addictive for many patients. 

&#160; 

In peripheral neuropathic pain, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first &#8209;line therapy in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain generally is treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants such as duloxetine, depakote, pregabalin, gabapentin and topiramate, and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. Although tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and SNRIs often show efficacy in treating neuropathic pain, they also have many drawbacks, including poor tolerability with side effects in most patients. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

As a development stage pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act , or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, but country &#8209;specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful. 

&#160; 

U.S. Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply explicitly with any 

&#160;

requirements during the product development, approval, or post &#8209;approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory protocols, or GLP, regulations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing in the United States; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current GCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA , to the FDA; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. This authorization is required before interstate shipping and administration of any new drug product to humans in the United States that is not the subject of an approved NDA. A 30 &#8209;day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30 &#8209;day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators following GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. We have begun to conduct our Phase 1, and plan to conduct our Phase 2, clinical trials for ZYN002 in Australia, subject to applicable regulatory approval, and have not filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA prior to the commencement of those Phase 1 clinical trials. 

&#160; 

In Australia, the approval process for commencing Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials resides with the Human Research Ethics Committee, or HREC. Prior to commencing a clinical trial, a sponsor must submit to the HREC a study protocol, an investigator brochure and a template informed consent for such clinical trial. The HREC approval process generally takes four to eight weeks. 

&#160; 

Once a study is approved by the HREC, a Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, is submitted to the Australian Government Department of Health, Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA. The CTN is a notification that the HREC has approved the safety, efficacy and ethical acceptability of the trial, approved the trial protocol and evaluated the scientific merit of the trial. The TGA sends the clinical trial site a written acknowledgement of the clinical trial, allowing the clinical trial to begin. TGA response time to acknowledge a clinical trial is approximately two weeks from receipt of the CTN from the clinical trial site. 

&#160; 

We must file an IND with the FDA and receive approval from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA , prior to commencement of any clinical trials in the United States. We plan to submit an IND prior to conducting &#160; any clinical trials in the United States. We plan to submit NDAs for ZYN002 and ZYN001 to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials. The informed written consent of each participating subject is required. The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is 

&#160;

generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigation product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PKs and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product candidate&#8217;s PKs and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product candidate for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well &#8209;controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited subject population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit &#8209;risk relationship of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. 

&#160; 

The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, or the clinical monitoring board. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. These decisions are based on the limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trials as well as clinical trial results after completion. 

&#160; 

A sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A sponsor meeting the regulatory criteria may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. We expect to test ZYN002 AND ZYN001 in several advanced stage clinical trials, including Phase 3 clinical trial for which we may request an SPA. Having an SPA does not guarantee that a product will receive FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA to request regulatory approval for the product in specified indications. 

&#160; 

New Drug Applications 

&#160; 

In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive 

&#160;

findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company &#8209;sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

&#160; 

In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten to twelve months. The FDA can extend this review by three months to consider certain late &#8209;submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

&#160; 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

&#160; 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post &#8209;approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

&#160; 

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 

&#160; 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

&#160; 

Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA &#8209;regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly &#8209;available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs. 

&#160; 

Advertising and Promotion 

&#160; 

The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct &#8209;to &#8209;consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry &#8209;sponsored 

&#160;

scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for &#8220;off &#8209;label&#8221; uses &#8212; that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling &#8212; because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off &#8209;label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off &#8209;label use, but may engage in non &#8209;promotional, balanced communication regarding off &#8209;label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. 

&#160; 

Post Approval Regulations 

&#160; 

After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post &#8209;approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post &#8209;marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a company would be required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to assure and preserve the long term stability of the drug or biological product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third &#8209;party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

&#160; 

Controlled Substances 

&#160; 

The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and its implementing regulations establish a &#8220;closed system&#8221; of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce. 

&#160; 

Facilities that research, manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them. 

&#160; 

The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules &#8212; Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V &#8212; with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently &#8220;accepted medical use&#8221; in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may be used only in federally &#8209;approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the United States. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations, and cannot be refilled. While Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain Cannabis or Cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II &#8209;V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the &#8220;acceptable medical use&#8221; requirement. 

&#160; 

The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of 

&#160;

controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer (not a dosage form manufacturer or a repacker/relabeler) for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections, or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by the DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non &#8209;narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non &#8209;narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary to ensure that the United States complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties. 

&#160; 

For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA&#8217;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of Cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies. 

&#160; 

The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

We currently manufacture the API for ZYN002 and ZYN001 in the United States and Canada . &#160; We are currently conducting Phase I clinical trials for ZYN002 in Australia and may conduct Phase 2 clinical trials in Australia subject to regulatory approval. We may also choose to conduct clinical trials for ZYN001 outside the United States subject to regulatory approval. W e may decide to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates in additional countries. As a result, we will also be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations from the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada&#8217;s Office of Controlled Substances in Canada, and from other regulatory agencies in other countries where we develop, manufacture or commercialize ZYN002 or ZYN001 in the future. 

&#160; 

The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act 

&#160; 

Orange Book Listing 

&#160; 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, same strengths and dosage form, as the listed drug and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the 

&#160;

same active ingredients as the listed drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

&#160; 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. 

&#160; 

The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non &#8209;patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 

&#160; 

Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three &#8209;year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three &#8209;year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical studies (other than bioequivalence studies) essential to the approval of the NDA. 

&#160; 

An ANDA may be submitted one year before marketing exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. In this case, the 30 months stay, if applicable, runs from the end of the five year marketing exclusivity period. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 

&#160; 

Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available under Section 505A of the FDCA if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or non &#8209;patent exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. 

&#160; 

Patent Term Extension 

&#160; 

The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 

&#160; 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

&#160; 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also 

&#160;

obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 

&#160; 

European and Other International Government Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

&#160; 

To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marke ting authorization application, or MAA . The MAA is similar to the NDA, with the exception of, among other things, country &#8209;specific document requirements. 

&#160; 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

Compliance 

&#160; 

During all phases of development (pre &#8209; and post &#8209;marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

Other Special Regulatory Procedures 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life &#8209;threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union community. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life &#8209;threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. 

&#160; 

In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. &#160; In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

&#160; 

Priority Review (United States) and Accelerated Review (European Union) 

&#160; 

Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA&#8217;s decision on priority review application, or eight months from the NDA filing. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from the FDA&#8217;s decision on priority review application, or 12 months from the NDA filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

&#160; 

Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding &#8220;clock stops,&#8221; when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which takes into consideration: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life &#8209;threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs, respectively; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, or Medicare Part D, coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50.0% point &#8209;of &#8209;sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers&#8217; outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

new requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any &#8220;payments or transfers of value&#8221; made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required beginning March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a new Patient &#8209;Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full &#8209;time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2015 (pursuant to relief enacted by the Treasury Department). 

&#160; 

The Affordable Care Act also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. Beginning in 2014, the IPAB was mandated to propose changes in Medicare payments if it determines that the rate of growth of Medicare expenditures exceeds target growth rates. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for pharmaceutical products. A proposal made by the IPAB is required to be implemented by the U.S. federal government&#8217;s Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services unless Congress adopts a proposal with savings greater than those proposed by the IPAB. The IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation years 2015 or 2016. 

&#160; 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third &#8209;party payors. Third &#8209;party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third &#8209;party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. Third &#8209;party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost &#8209;effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost &#8209;effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost &#8209;effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third &#8209;party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

&#160; 

The Medicare Modernization Act , or &#160; MMA enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2003, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products, including creating the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients 

&#160;

through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. 

&#160; 

Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Rebate amounts for a product are determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute: AMP, which must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program, and best price, which must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221; obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24% known as the federal ceiling price for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. 

&#160; 

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost &#8209;effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower &#8209;priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross &#8209;border imports from low &#8209;priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

&#160; 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third &#8209;party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third &#8209;party reimbursement rates may change at any time. 

&#160; 

Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160; 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent 

&#160;

requirement of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

&#160; 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non &#8209;reimbursable, uses. HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third &#8209;party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

&#160; 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates&#8221; &#8212; independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160; 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre &#8209;marketing product approvals, private &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post &#8209;marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti &#8209;fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

&#160; 

In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Contracts and Grants 

&#160; 

To date we have been awarded approximately $7.9 million in state and federal grants which have provided us with funding and resources to continue the development of our product candidates and contributed to research and development efforts outside of our primary therapeutic focus. Approximately $6.0 million of our grant funds have been received from the NIH, and some of these funds support research related to ZYN001. 

&#160; 

Scientific Advisors &#160; 

&#160; 

We have established a clinical advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these experienced clinical leaders on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our clinical advisory board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. We intend to continue to leverage the broad expertise of our advisors by seeking their counsel on important topics relating to our product development and clinical development programs. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our clinical advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of our clinical advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us. Our current clinical advisors are set forth in the table below:

&#160; 

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of exemptions from various disclosure and reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes &#8209;Oxley Act of 2002; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in each case, instead of three years for any Securities Act filings ; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

being permitted to present the same number of years of selected financial data as the years of audited financial statements presented, instead of five years; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, including no Compensation Disclosure and Analysis; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#8217;s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our exemption from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

&#160; 

We may rely on these provisions until December 31, 2020 . However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such period, including if we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer,&#8221; our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non &#8209;convertible debt in any three &#8209;year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such period. 

&#160; 

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 

&#160; 

The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
