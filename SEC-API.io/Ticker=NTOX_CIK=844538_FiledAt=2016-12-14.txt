 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We are a company in the business of developing and commercializing innovative technologies. Through Tropic Spa, our goal is to market a unique home mist tanning system for convenient home use that delivers a full-body application and eliminates the harmful health effects associated with traditional tanning beds. The primary effect is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and the consequences of such exposure have been well-documented by numerous organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the Canadian Cancer Society. They generally include an increase in the risk of contracting both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers as well as structural damage to the skin that can result in what dermatologists call &#8220;photoageing&#8221;, or premature wrinkles, freckles, leathery texture and a loss of elasticity. 

&#160; 

To date, we have finalized the design of our product, applied for and acquired patents for it in the United States (the &#8220;US Patent&#8221;), Canada and Australia, and have a patent pending that is in the process of being completed for China. We have also prepared our product for market and completed two phases of test marketing initiatives, and we are currently preparing to launch a comprehensive three-phase marketing strategy. 

&#160; 

Through Notox, we own 100% of the right, title and interest in and to the License Agreement with the Clinic formerly held by ZHC. The License Agreement grants us the exclusive license to certain patented intellectual property of the Clinic relating to the treatment of a neuromuscular defect developed by Dr. Frank Papay, MD, FACS Chairman Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute, Cleveland Clinic, and in particular, the ability to produce and sell products that incorporate such intellectual property in the fields of aesthetics and pain. We plan to develop this intellectual property into the world&#8217;s first credible and healthier non-toxic alternative to Botox, which is a commercial form of the botulinum toxin protein used primarily for medical and cosmetic purposes. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160; 

We were incorporated as &#8220;Rockford Minerals Inc.&#8221; under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 29, 2007. From our inception until the closing of the Share Exchange, we sought to be a producer of gold and silver ore, and of other precious metals. On July 19, 2008, we acquired an undeveloped mining claim called the Rockford Lode Mining Claim located in Clark County, Nevada, for which we paid $12,000, including the cost of a geological report prepared by Sookochoff Consultants Inc. and Laurence Sookochoff, P. Eng., as a consulting geologist, for the purpose of recommending an exploration program. Due to lack of capital, we did not commence any phase of the exploration program recommended in the geological report. 

&#160; 

On August 24, 2010, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase our authorized capital from 10,000,000 shares of common stock to 100,000,000, each with a par value of $0.001 per share. On April 17, 2013, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 300,000,000, each with a par value of $0.001 per share. 

&#160; 

On June 24, 2013, we purchased one common share of Subco and one common share of 1894631 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation (&#8220;Callco&#8221;), from Gregory J. Neely, our former President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director. Both of these companies were incorporated on April 15, 2013 in anticipation of completing the Share Exchange, and became our wholly owned subsidiaries as a result of the share purchases. 

&#160; 

Prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, we had not generated any revenue and our operations were primarily limited to capital formation, organization and development of our business plan. As a result of the Share Exchange, we ceased our prior operations and, through Tropic Spa, began to operate as a company that manufactures and sells home mist tanning units with a patent-protected feature. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In order to more accurately reflect our new business operations, on December 6, 2013, we changed our name from &#8220;Rockford Minerals Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Tropic International Inc.&#8221; as a result of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary that was incorporated solely to effect the name change. 

&#160; 

Tropic Spa was incorporated under the laws of the Province Ontario on September 17, 2007. Its operations to date have consisted of business formation, strategic development, test marketing, technology development and capital raising activities. Its website is www.tropicspatan.com. 

&#160; 

On April 11, 2013 and in anticipation of completing the Share Exchange, Tropic Spa completed a vertical amalgamation with 1893211 Ontario Inc., an Ontario corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary. The amalgamation was approved by the directors of each of Tropic Spa and 1893211 Ontario Inc., and was completed for the sole purpose of merging the two corporations and carrying on as one entity. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Tropic Spa 

&#160; 

On the Closing Date, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Subco, Tropic Spa and the Tropic Spa Shareholders pursuant to which we acquired approximately 78% of the outstanding capital stock of Tropic Spa in exchange for the issuance of 78,030,877 (39,015,439 post-split) preferred shares of Subco to the Tropic Spa Shareholders. The shares issued to the Tropic Spa Shareholders pursuant to the Share Exchange constituted 100% of Subco&#8217;s issued and outstanding preferred shares as of and immediately after the consummation of the Share Exchange. Each one preferred share of Subco (each, an &#8220;Exchangeable Share&#8221;) is exchangeable into one share of our common stock at the option of the holder thereof, subject to the following restrictions: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the holders of such preferred shares may not, without the written consent of Subco, exchange, sell or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of their preferred shares until the six month anniversary of the Closing Date; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; within 30 days of that time, and provided Tropic Spa has generated at least $1,000,000 in gross revenue during the preceding six month period, Subco shall permit the holders of such preferred shares to require Subco to redeem an aggregate of 1% of its then-outstanding preferred shares on a pro rata basis; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; within 30 days of each six month anniversary of the Closing Date until June 30, 2015, on which date all restrictions on such preferred shares shall automatically expire unless extended by the approval of the holders thereof, Subco shall grant the holders of its preferred shares a permission identical to the one described above. &#160; 

The foregoing restrictions do not apply to any exchange, sale or other disposition of the preferred shares of Subco by the holder thereof: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; to a person over which such holder exercises sole voting and investment control; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; upon such holder&#8217;s death by will or intestacy; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; as a distribution solely to members, partners or stockholders of such holder, if the holder is a corporation, partnership or other organization. &#160; 

The foregoing description of the preferred shares of Subco is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached to such preferred shares (the &#8220;Exchangeable Share Provisions&#8221;), included as Appendix I to the Exchange Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on July 3, 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

As a result of the Share Exchange, Tropic Spa became our majority-owned subsidiary and John Marmora, the sole officer and director of Tropic Spa, acquired the right to become our principal stockholder by exchanging the Exchangeable Shares he received on the Closing Date for shares of our common stock. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse merger/recapitalization effected through a share exchange, with Tropic Spa as the accounting acquirer and the Company as the accounting acquiree. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the Share Exchange, we are referring to the business and financial information of Tropic Spa. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Share Exchange and on the Closing Date, Gregory J. Neely submitted his resignation as our President, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary and Treasurer; John Marmora was appointed by our Board of Directors to fill the resulting vacancies; Mr. Marmora was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and a director; Mr. Neely submitted his resignation as the President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director of Subco and Callco, and Mr. Marmora was appointed to fill the resulting vacancies. On November 29, 2013, Mr. Neely also resigned as our director. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Share Exchange, Tropic Spa became our majority-owned subsidiary and we assumed the business and operations of Tropic Spa. 

&#160; 

As a condition of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, we also entered into the following agreements on the Closing Date: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a Support Agreement with Subco and Callco (the &#8220;Support Agreement&#8221;); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; a Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement with Subco, Callco and John Marmora (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), our new President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and director (the &#8220;Trust Agreement&#8221;). &#160; 

The structure of the Share Exchange was determined largely based on the potential tax implications for the Tropic Spa shareholders of exchanging their common shares of Tropic Spa, an Ontario corporation, for shares of our common stock. Under s. 85(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), a tax-deferred &#8220;rollover&#8221; is not available where shares of a Canadian corporation are exchanged for shares of a United States corporation and, as a result, we created Subco, also an Ontario corporation, for the purpose of allowing those shareholders who elected to participate in the Share Exchange to do so on a tax-deferred &#8220;rollover&#8221; basis (i.e., by allowing them to defer any capital gain that would accrue upon the exchange of their common shares of Tropic Spa for shares of our common stock). This was achieved by issuing exchangeable preferred shares of Subco to the holders of Tropic Spa&#8217;s common shares on the Closing Date. 

&#160; 

Callco, our wholly owned subsidiary, was formed solely for the purpose of avoiding a Canadian deemed dividend withholding tax payable on a dividend or other distribution of Subco to us to the extent that such a dividend or other distribution exceeds the paid-up capital of Subco. However, in order for this to take place Callco must become the holder of the one issued and outstanding common share of Subco that we currently hold, since it would then permit the dividend or other distribution to pass through Callco before being distributed to us. 

&#160; 

On February 17, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment Agreement&#8221;) with Subco, Tropic Spa and the Tropic Spa Shareholders in order to correct a few administrative errors in the Exchange Agreement and provide for the post-closing execution of the Exchange Agreement by those shareholders of Tropic Spa who were not original signatories thereto. The complete text of the Amendment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 19, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Also on February 17, 2015, the Tropic Spa Shareholders approved certain changes to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attached to the preferred shares of Subco described above by consent in writing. Of these, the only material change was the deletion of the &#8220;June 30, 2015&#8221; date in section 5(b) and its replacement with &#8220;June 30, 2017&#8221;. 

&#160; 

On August 24, 2016 and pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, as amended, we acquired a further 21,672,623 common shares, or approximately 21.5% of the issued and outstanding shares, of Tropic Spa in exchange for the issuance of 21,672,623 (10,836,312 post-split) preferred shares of Subco to certain of the shareholders of Tropic Spa. As a result, we now own 99,703,500 common shares of Tropic Spa, or approximately 99.7% of that company&#8217;s issued and outstanding capital stock. 

&#160; 

Support Agreement 

&#160; 

The Support Agreement provides and establishes a procedure whereby we are required to take certain actions and make certain payments and deliveries in connection with the satisfaction of the obligations of Callco and/or Subco under the Exchangeable Share Provisions. As described in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, Subco is required to deliver shares of our common stock to a holder of Exchangeable Shares upon the liquidation or insolvency of Subco, upon the redemption of Exchangeable Shares by Subco, and upon the exercise of the retraction or exchange right by such holder. The Exchangeable Share Provisions also require Subco to pay dividends on the Exchangeable Shares that are equivalent to any dividends that are paid on shares of our common stock. 

&#160; 

The Support Agreement provides commercial certainty and is in the interests of the holders of Exchangeable Shares because it creates enforceable contractual rights of Subco against us so that in all relevant circumstances Subco is in a position to acquire the necessary shares of our common stock, and finance any dividend payments equivalent to dividends paid on shares of our common stock, in order to satisfy Subco&#8217;s obligations under the Exchangeable Share Provisions. In that respect, the Support Agreement includes certain covenants made by us, including that we will: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; not declare or pay a dividend on shares of our common stock unless Subco can simultaneously pay the same dividend on the Exchangeable Shares; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; ensure that Subco has a sufficient number of shares of our common stock in the event of the liquidation or insolvency of Subco to satisfy all retraction or exchange requests or redemptions of Exchangeable Shares; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; as the sole holder of common shares of Subco, not cause Subco to be liquidated or dissolved. &#160; 

In general, the Support Agreement ensures that the obligations of Subco are backstopped by covenants made by us or any successor to us. It will remain in effect until no Exchangeable Shares (or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for Exchangeable Shares) are held by any person other than us or any of our affiliates (in other words, until all the Exchangeable Shares have been exchanged into shares of our common stock). 

&#160; 

Trust Agreement 

&#160; 

The Trust Agreement provides and establishes a procedure whereby the voting rights attached to shares of our common stock are exercisable by the registered holders (the &#8220;Beneficiaries&#8221;) of the Exchangeable Shares, other than those Exchangeable Shares held by us or our affiliates, through the Trustee. The Trustee holds legal title to a special voting share (the &#8220;Special Voting Share&#8221;) to which voting rights are attached for the benefit of the Beneficiaries. 

&#160; 

The Special Voting Share confers on the Trustee the number of votes equal to the number of outstanding Exchangeable Shares, other than Exchangeable Shares held by us or our affiliates, on all matters on which the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to vote. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to hold the Special Voting Share as trustee solely for the use and benefit of the Beneficiaries and has no power or authority to sell, transfer, vote or otherwise deal with the Special Voting Share. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The Trust Agreement provides a mechanism under which a Beneficiary may instruct the Trustee regarding how to vote the votes conferred by the Special Voting Share relating to such Beneficiary&#8217;s Exchangeable Shares. This mechanism ensures that Beneficiaries have a complete bundle of rights that collectively is equivalent to the rights each Beneficiary would have if it owned shares of our common stock directly, and is exercised by Beneficiaries providing written instructions to the Trustee following the mailing of any communications by us to the holders of our common stock as well as the holders of Exchangeable Shares. 

&#160; 

For commercial reasons, it is in the interests of a holder of Exchangeable Shares to obtain additional protection with respect to its ability to exercise retraction or exchange rights in the event of the liquidation or insolvency of us or Subco. As a result, the Trust Agreement also grants such holders &#8220;insolvency put rights&#8221;, including the right to automatically exchange their Exchangeable Shares for shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. 

&#160; 

The right of a Beneficiary to exercise any voting rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary will cease immediately upon the exercise of any exchange right, automatic exchange, retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares for shares of our common stock, or the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Subco. 

&#160; 

The foregoing description of the Exchange Agreement, including the Support Agreement and the Trust Agreement, includes a summary of all the material provisions but is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Exchange Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 3, 2013. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Notox 

&#160; 

On June 6, 2016, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the &#8220;Notox Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Notox and the Notox Shareholders pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Notox in exchange for the issuance of 100,000,000 (50,000,000 post-split) restricted shares of our common stock to the Notox Shareholders. On the Notox Closing Date, the closing of the Notox Share Exchange Agreement occurred, at which time Notox acquired 100% of the right, title and interest in and to the License Agreement, we issued the 100,000,000 restricted shares described above to the Notox Shareholders, and Notox became our wholly owned subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a stock restriction agreement dated as of the Notox Closing Date, the shares we issued to the Notox Shareholders are subject to restrictions similar to those attached to the preferred shares of Subco. In particular, the Notox Shareholders may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of their shares until June 30, 2017, subject to certain limited exceptions. 

&#160; 

Notox was incorporated on May 31, 2016 for the primary purpose of acquiring an interest in and to the License Agreement. As such, the Notox Share Exchange represented an asset acquisition and was accounted for under the asset acquisition method. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Notox Share Exchange and on the Notox Closing Date, John Marmora submitted his resignation as our Chief Executive Officer and Zoran Konevic, the sole officer and director of both Notox and ZHC, and one of the Notox Shareholders, was appointed to fill the resulting vacancy. On the Closing Date, Mr. Konevic was also appointed as our director. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Notox Share Exchange, we are now a holding company operating through both Tropic Spa and Notox. 

&#160; 

The foregoing description of the Notox Exchange Agreement includes a summary of all the material provisions but is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Notox Exchange Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.3 to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 13, 2016. 

&#160; 

Reverse Split 

&#160; 

On August 25, 2016, we completed a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock at the ratio of one (1) new share for every two (2) existing shares and caused Subco to do the same. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our home mist tanning system delivers a full-body application in 12 seconds resulting in a tan that develops gradually over a period of five to eight hours and lasts from between five and eight days. The packages we market contain everything an individual needs to complete 10 full-body tans in the comfort of their own home. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Our tanning system was designed for home use to provide users with a salon quality tan. It consists of an application unit, a tanning kit and a pre-tan kit. The tanning kit includes our proprietary tanning solution, which is a clear fluid with a slight yellow tinge that contains a blend of DHA or dihydroxyacetone (a chemical approved by the Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) for use in the cosmetics industry), skin moisturizers and conditioners. DHA is a color additive that darkens the skin by reacting with amino acids in the skin&#8217;s surface. To be clear, however, the FDA&#8217;s approval of DHA is restricted to external applications only; the agency advises against inhaling, ingesting or applying DHA to the lips and eye areas; and the use of DHA in tanning booths, including misting devices, as an all-over spray has not been approved by the FDA since safety data to support its use has not been submitted to the agency for review and evaluation. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary tanning solution is packaged into specially designed cosmetic bladders and housed in aerosol cans, which allows users to dispense it directly with no cross-contamination of propellant or any other material. In addition to six 2.6oz cans of the solution, the tanning kit contains a spray applicator and one touch-up can, while the pre-tan kit contains exfoliating wipes or gloves (selected by the user at the time of purchase), plastic head and foot covers and plastic protective gloves. 

&#160; 

Our system may affect persons of different sizes in different manners since the amount of tanning solution dispensed from each of the unique, non-clogging mist nozzles on the unit cannot be user-adjusted. The nozzles are manufactured using a plastic injection molding process in order to ensure that they all perform in an identical fashion and are designed to emit a consistent amount of solution. As a result, during each tanning cycle the nozzles dispense a total of approximately 1.6oz of tanning solution from the cosmetic bladders. Due to this consistency, the recommend minimum and maximum user heights for our units are 4&#8217;5&#8221; and 6&#8221;, respectively. We have not made any provisions to accommodate users who fall outside of this height range, since we believe that such persons only represent an extremely small proportion of our potential customer base. 

&#160; 

Our application unit has been engineered to apply our tanning solution evenly through unique, non-clogging mist nozzles and deliver a sufficient amount of the solution in 12 seconds to provide full body coverage. Over-spray is minimal or nonexistent, and the cordless design of the unit allows it to be used in multiple locations and deliver multiple applications on a single lithium ion battery charge. Each unit contains an internal counter that indicates when there is only enough tanning solution remaining to complete two tans, and consists of a simple design that allows for the easy removal and replacement of the solution. 

&#160; 

Constructed of lightweight durable plastic in a neutral tone, the application units are visually appealing, compact in size and come fully assembled, requiring only a primary battery charge of approximately four hours to begin the tanning process. The units also include a unique adjustable hanger bracket that permits simple height adjustments and both visual cues and audible electronic tones that provide important information to users as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; when the start/stop button on the unit is pushed, the light-emitting diode (LED) on the unit flashes the color blue for 10 seconds; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; if no further action is taken by a user during the 10-second period, the unit automatically powers down; however, if the user again pushes the start/stop button, the unit emits an audible beep signalling that the tanning spray will be activated in six seconds; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; at the end of the six seconds, the unit emits an &#8220;up-tone&#8221; sound and begins to mist; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; during the 12 second tanning cycle, the unit emits an audible beep every three seconds in order to orient the user and suggest that they rotate 90 degrees in each three-second period (for a total of 360 degrees in 12 seconds); &#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; following the fourth audible beep, the unit emits a &#8220;down-tone&#8221; to signal the conclusion of the tanning cycle; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; finally, when the reset button is pushed, the unit emits an audible beep to signal that the unit&#8217;s tan count has been reset to 10 tans. &#160; 

The lithium ion battery included with each application unit can be fully recharged in approximately eight hours once fully depleted through a conventional North American wall socket. The batteries are provided to us by an electronics supplier based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who acquires them from a manufacturer in China. We do not have an agreement in place with the supplier regarding the purchase and sale of specified quantities of batteries; instead, we purchase them on an as-needed basis using conventional means. 

&#160; 

Our application unit has been certified by QPS Evaluation Services, Inc. (&#8220;QPS&#8221;), a nationally and internationally accredited third-party testing, certification and field evaluation body, under certificate number LR1209. This certification provides an increased assurance of quality and safety to consumers by demonstrating that the unit has been tested to and meets the requirements of applicable Canadian and Unites States standards, since QPS&#8217;s labels and marks are accepted as equals to those of the Canadian Standards Association and Underwriters Laboratories. 

&#160; 

Because we are committed to supplying products of superior quality and design, we provide a limited one year warranty on our application units. If a unit stops operating due to defects in materials or workmanship during this time, we will either repair or replace it for free. 

&#160; 

In addition to the application units, we also sell tanning solution kit refills that take less than five minutes to replace. Each tanning solution kit refill contains six 2.6oz cans, which is a sufficient amount of our proprietary solution to provide 10 full-body tans. To the best of our knowledge, empty cans of our tanning solution can be recycled in the same manner as conventional aerosol cans in all jurisdictions that offer recycling alternatives to conventional waste collection. 

&#160; 

We currently sell our home mist tanning system for the base price of $300 and our tanning solution kit refills for $100, each plus applicable shipping and handling. The complete system also includes an operating manual, instructional DVD and simple power adapter. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview and Competition 

&#160; 

There are currently many products on the market geared towards providing users with a sunless tan. These include bronzers, gels, foams and lotions, all of which can vary dramatically in both quality and price. Based on the research we have conducted, it is our belief that these products can be quite messy and often yield unreliable results. Recently, airbrush or spray tanning products for home use have gained a foothold in the market, but anecdotal evidence suggests that these products can be tricky to apply evenly and can discolor and streak the skin if not used properly. There are also a small number of medical sunless tanning alternatives, but the market for these is extremely limited. 

&#160; 

Given the uncertainty associated with applying or using many sunless tanning products, consumers have gravitated to the salon or spa in search of natural looking results. The most popular method of obtaining a sunless tan at these establishments that doesn&#8217;t include exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays is through a spray tan. However, this is generally understood to be a costly pursuit, especially over the long term. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

A summary of the various options is provided below. 

&#160; 

Bronzers, Gels, Foams and Lotions 

&#160; 

Bronzers, gels, foams and lotions generally cost between $12 and $65 per bottle. Apart from bronzers, each of these products uses DHA or dihydroxyacetone as an active ingredient in order to create a reaction between the product and dead skin cells to obtain darker looking skin. In our opinion, bronzers, gels, foam and lotions can often be difficult to apply evenly, especially in hard-to-reach places, as they require users to apply the product onto their body using their hands. They frequently streak and discolor the skin if applied incorrectly, as well as leave the hands and nails of users with an undesirable orange hue. Gloves can help but the products often stick to them and create an uneven result. 

&#160; 

Lotions can provide a more satisfying application than gels, but because of the moisturizing properties often added to these products they can also clog pores which may not be suitable for users with sensitive skin or who are acne-prone. Lotions also take a longer time to dry and users must wear loose clothing until they have properly dried. 

&#160; 

Bronzers are simply a short term solution for a glow. They exist in gel form but often consist of a powder to be applied with a makeup brush. If applied incorrectly we believe that bronzers can look too dark and they also have the drawback of sometimes rubbing off on clothes. 

&#160; 

Prominent manufacturers of bronzers, gels, foams and lotions include Banana Boat, Jergens, Hawaiian Tropic and L&#8217;Or&#233;al. 

&#160; 

Medical Alternatives 

&#160; 

There are two drugs available on the market related to sunless tanning. The first of these is canthaxanthin, a colorant commonly used as a food dye. Though the FDA and Heath Canada have approved canthaxanthin as a color additive in foods (see the FDA&#8217;s &#8220;More on Tanning Products&#8221; Safety and Regulatory Information page and Health Canada&#8217;s Natural Health Products Ingredients Database), it has not been approved for use as a sunless tanning pill since consumption of large amounts has been linked to liver injury and canthaxanthin retinopathy, a form of retina discoloration. 

&#160; 

The second drug is called Melanotan II and is also known as the &#8220;Barbie drug&#8221;. Basically, it is an injectable that mimics melanin in skin. Although widely available, according to the Canadian Cancer Society both the FDA and Heath Canada have warned the public that the drug has not been tested and should be avoided until further research has been completed to test its possible side effects. 

&#160; 

Home Use Airbrushing 

&#160; 

Several options have been developed over time for home use airbrushing. Temptu manufactures a portable airbrushing unit that retails for US$305, with each refill costing US$45 per tanning pod. The unit was designed to tan only the face, but we believe many consumers also use it to tan their entire body. Based on our research, we understand that two tanning pods are required for such a tan, which would therefore cost a consumer $90 for one fully-body tan. 

&#160; 

Luminess Tan is another manufacturer of airbrush tanning products. It sells a small portable unit for home tanning use that costs US$159 for a starter pack and US$32 for two 1.5oz bottle refills. In our opinion, the primary drawback of the Luminess Tan unit is that consumers need to have a steady hand to apply the product properly and may require a second person to apply it in hard-to-reach areas. We have also been informed that the company&#8217;s application wand may become clogged with frequent use. 

&#160; 

St. Tropez, Model Co. and Victoria&#8217;s Secret, among others, have recently entered the growing &#8220;spray tan in a can&#8221; market. Their products come in mist form, but without experience we believe that consumers run the risk of leaving streaks from applying them incorrectly. It can also be difficult to access certain parts of the body with sprays, such as the back, and over-spraying can lead to an uneven tan. Users of these products must also keep the nozzle approximately six inches from their skin in order to maintain an even application. &#8220;Spray tan in a can&#8221; can cost anywhere from US$12 to US$40 per unit. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

The SheerTan Sunless Tanning wand provides an attractive option for hard-to-reach areas such as the back. To use the product, consumers must insert the mist into the wand and then move the wand around their body. The wand is bulky and can therefore be challenging to manoeuvre, but the cost is appealing at US$40 for the starter set. However, the price of refills is comparable to others at US$50 for a set of four. 

&#160; 

Home Use Spray Tanning 

&#160; 

Similar to airbrushing, spray tanning provides consumers with the ability to tan their entire body without having to refill the machines quite as often. Despite our research and industry knowledge, we are not aware of any independent reports or market analysis focused on this specific segment of the sunless tanning market; however, to the best of our knowledge and belief there is only one spray machine available in the Canadian and United States home use market that is somewhat comparable to ours: the ShowerTan system manufactured by RNJ Enterprizes, LLC. 

&#160; 

The ShowerTan system is a portable unit that must be used in the shower. The starter unit retails for US$345 and the refills are priced at US$45 for four single-use bottles. In order to use the system, consumers also need to purchase CO2 tanning cartridges at a cost of $23 for 10 cartridges and add both the tanning solution and cartridges to the unit. We believe that the use of CO2 cartridges poses a potential hazard to consumers, and we designed our home mist tanning system differently as a result. ShowerTan also offers bronzing drops to mix into its solution for tan customization purposes. 

&#160; 

In our opinion and based on the market research we have conducted, the ShowerTan machine has an industrial feel, is rather bulky and is visually intimidating because of its complexity. In addition, the unit must be cleaned after each use, which adds to the time required to obtain consistent tanning results. 

&#160; 

Salon Airbrushing and Spray Tanning 

&#160; 

Spray tans and airbrush tans are similar; however, with an airbrush tan a salon or spa technician applies the tanning solution and with a spray tan the consumer enters a private booth and is then sprayed by a machine to obtain a natural looking tan. Although there is little room for error, spray tanning has proven to be consistent and produce reliable results. Unfortunately, the cost can be high as one session from a professional salon or spa generally ranges from $40-120 plus the cost of a touch-up kit. To maintain a tan, a consumer would need to repeat the process every five to 14 days depending on his or her skin and the extent of exfoliation prior to tanning. In urban centers, the cost of professional spray tan maintenance can add up to over $1,000 per year. 

&#160; 

With salon airbrushing and spray tanning, privacy can also be an issue since more bashful consumers may be uncomfortable disrobing in a strange place to receive an application. Time must also be considered, as many salons require an appointment and consumers therefore need to plan ahead and organize their schedule. For salon-based sunless tanning alternatives, time and money are the most important factors to consider. 

&#160; 

The market for sunless tanning products is highly competitive with respect to performance, quality and price. We anticipate that we will directly compete with those competitors whom we identified above, as well as with other local and regional manufacturers. We may also compete with artificial sunbed tanning establishments and manufacturers and suppliers of similar products and services; however, we do not consider these direct competitors because their processes involve exposing the skin to harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. 

&#160; 

In the future, we also may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors. Some of our competitors have, or may have, greater financial, marketing and other resources. As a result, competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging trends and changes in technology, benefit from greater purchasing economies, offer more aggressive pricing to customers or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products than we are capable of accomplishing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete in the future with such competitors, and the failure to successfully compete could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

&#160; 

Marketing Plan 

&#160; 

As described above, we currently compete with several companies offering a number of different sunless tanning products. We believe the opportunity exists for us to take advantage of the very broad sunless tanning market by emphasizing the benefits of our home mist tanning system in relation to the products offered by our competitors. In this respect, we plan to focus our marketing efforts on the following competitive advantages: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the speed with which our system can provide a full-body tan application; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the convenience of being able to use our system in the comfort of your home; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the quality of our proprietary tanning solution; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the evenness with which our application unit distributes the tanning solution; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the simplicity of the application unit&#8217;s design and its corresponding ease-of-use. &#160; 

We have not yet begun to fully implement our marketing plan. However, we have completed two phases of test marketing: one in Canada and another in the United States. These are the countries in which we expect to concentrate our operations, and both phases involved the production and airing of a basic infomercial and a coordinated introductory social media campaign. We decided to undertake these initiatives for the primary purpose of collecting data about our target markets in preparation for launching the more extensive marketing strategy described below. In furtherance of this objective, we also retained the services of two public relations consultants to assist us with promoting our brand name and reaching media sources such as print magazines and television talk shows. 

&#160; 

We have decided to adopt a three-phase strategy in order to successfully market our home mist tanning system and products under the Tropic Spa brand name. This strategy consists of a branding phase, an infomercial phase and a retail phase, all of which will be accompanied by continuous efforts to increase sales of our products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Branding : during this phase, we expect to generate word-of-mouth and brand recognition for our Tropic Spa products through social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter, and by advertising selectively on talk shows, radio and in fashion and beauty magazines. We may also decide to provide complimentary home mist tanning systems to known trendsetters in order to generate publicity, increase our commercial presence and gain consumer awareness. Although we have yet to begin implementing any such initiatives in earnest, we anticipate that any recognition we are able to achieve will promote our home mist tanning system as a viable, inexpensive solution to the myriad sunless tanning alternatives currently on the market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Infomercial : during this phase, we plan to launch a major television infomercial campaign to strengthen our Tropic Spa brand and generate significant sales increases. This phase will also incorporate an ecommerce component, including the launch of an enhanced version of our website. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Retail : during this phase, we hope to begin selling our home mist tanning system through bricks-and-mortar establishments, including at select stores within major retail chains. The locations at which we are able to obtain shelf space will likely depend, among other things, on the relationships we are able to develop with product consultants of those stores, and the completion of a detailed analysis of market demand and demographics relating to the tanning sector in general. &#160; 

Despite the fact we have not yet started to pursue the first phase of our strategy to any significant extent, our home mist tanning system has already been the subject of a number of articles in specialty newspapers and on fashion magazine blogs and Twitter accounts. These include Westside Today (Los Angeles), The Green Connoisseur and Wire LA. 

&#160; 

We expect to spend approximately $600,000 to pursue our marketing plan over the next 12 months, the bulk of which we expect to allocate to producing and airing a new infomercial. We do not currently have sufficient funds to carry out all three phases of our strategy, so as described elsewhere in this Report, we intend to meet the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements. Currently we are active in contacting broker/dealers in Canada and elsewhere regarding possible financing arrangements; however, we do not currently have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing any such financings. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising efforts, we may review other financing options, although we cannot provide any assurance that any such options will be available to us or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. If we are not able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to scale back our marketing plans or eliminate them altogether. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

In addition to the supplier of our lithium ion batteries described in the &#8220;Products&#8221; section, above, we have developed relationships with two other companies that manufacture the plastic components of our application units and our proprietary tanning solution, respectively. Both of these manufacturers are located in the metropolitan area around Toronto, Ontario, Canada and, although we do not have formal supply agreements in place with them, we are able to purchase sufficient component quantities from them to fulfill demand for our products on an as-needed basis using conventional purchase orders. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Notox 

&#160; 

The Notox product was designed to be a non-poisonous, less expensive, longer lasting alternative to Botox &#174; , which is a commercial form of the botulinum toxin protein manufactured by Allergan, Plc, a large publicly-traded pharmaceutical corporation, and used primarily for medical and cosmetic purposes. Notox is designed to achieve the same effects as Botox &#174; for cosmetic procedures, pain, and migraine and sweat relief. 

&#160; 

Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxic protein that is most commonly associated with the disease botulism; however, there are actually seven types of the toxin, two of which are used commercially and medically to, among other things, treat muscle spasms and diseases characterized by overactive muscle. When locally administered, the toxin is capable of spreading from the injection site to other areas of the body, a potentially fatal consequence. 

&#160; 

In cosmetic applications, botulinum toxin is generally considered safe and effective for reducing facial wrinkles. It is injected into the muscles under wrinkles causing those muscles to relax, which results in the smoothing of the overlying skin. Following treatment, this smoothing is usually visible within days, is at its height after two weeks, and diminishes 3-4 months later as the treated muscles gradually regain function and return to their former appearance. Muscles can be treated repeatedly in order to maintain the smoothed appearance. 

&#160; 

Notox is best understood as an electronic form of Botox &#174; , in that it is intended to generate the benefits of using the drug without introducing the potentially harmful side effects that toxic chemicals can produce. The Notox system consists of two parts: a treatment probe or needle, and a unit that includes a hand piece and a generator. The generator is responsible for creating an electric current that is administered through the hand piece along with a saline solution. The needle, which is also the patented feature of the system, is attached to the hand piece and is used to inject the electric current and saline solution into the targeted nerve of the treatment recipient. 

&#160; 

The saline solution&#8217;s purpose is to assist with the accuracy of the current while simultaneously cooling the treatment area. The result is that the targeted nerve is ablated or incapacitated in much the same way as it would be by using Botox &#174; . 

&#160; 

We anticipate that Notox will provide a number of advantages over its similarly-named competitor as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; it will eliminate the potential morbidity and long-term effects of injecting botulinum toxin that an individual&#8217;s body must process and discard; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; treatments will be more precise and significantly less expensive; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the effects of a Notox treatment will last much longer than a Botox &#174; treatment &#8211; up to 12 months vs, 3-4 months; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the probability of damaging the tissue surrounding the target area will be reduced. &#160; 

The design of the treatment probe or needle is covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,512,715 &#8220; Apparatus and Method for Treating a Neuromuscular Defect&#8221; dated December 30, 2014. It is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application No. 12/541,221, filed on August 14, 2009, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/089,015, filed on August 14, 2008. 

&#160; 

It is important to note that the Clinic has already conducted successful animal trials using an early Notox system prototype, the results of which were published in October 2013 edition of the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Volume 132, Issue 4S-1, pp. 142-143. In addition, the Clinic has performed cadaver studies that generally demonstrated sensitive tissue would not be damaged using Notox. 

&#160; 

In a September 2016 report, Global Industry Analysts, Inc. (&#8220;GIA&#8221;) estimated that the worldwide market for botulinum toxin would reach US$4.3 billion by 2018. This represents less than 15% of the estimated $29 billion global market for cosmetic, plastic surgery and pain management solutions. In its report, GIA suggested that the market for botulinum toxin would be stimulated by the sustained dominance of existing options, technological advances, rising product approvals and the increasing popularity of anti-aging products. It is our goal to capture a piece of this market by completing the design, testing and manufacturing of the Notox unit and treatment probe, undertaking the necessary human trials and FDA Section 510(k) clearance process, and successfully commercializing the system. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our home mist tanning system is currently protected by U.S. Patent No. 7,594,593, Canadian Patent No. 2,685,941 and Australian Patent No. 2012227220. We have also filed a patent application in China. A summary of those patents and patent applications is provided below. 

&#160; 

Type &#160; Name &#160; Region &#160; Number &#160; &#160; Date Patent &#160; Apparatus for Spray Application of a Sunless Tanning Product &#160; United States &#160; &#160; 7,594,593 &#160; &#160; January 17, 2006 (Filed) / September 29, 2009 (Issued) Patent &#160; Apparatus for Spray Application of a Sunless Tanning Product &#160; Canada &#160; &#160; 2,685,941 &#160; &#160; April 5, 2007 (Filed) / June 21, 2016 (Granted and Issued) Patent &#160; Automated Mist Tanning Apparatus &#160; Australia &#160; &#160; 2012227220 &#160; &#160; September 24, 2012 (Filed) / October 16, 2014 (Granted) Patent Application &#160; Apparatus for Spray Application of a Sunless Tanning Product &#160; China &#160; &#160; 200780053225.1 &#160; &#160; December 4, 2009 (Filed) &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our United States Patent is a &#8220;utility patent&#8221;, which in general terms protects the way an article is used and works. A &#8220;design patent&#8221;, on the other hand, protects the way an article looks. Other primary distinguishing features between the two types of patents are as follows: the term of a &#8220;utility patent&#8221; is 20 years measured from the filing date, whereas the term of a &#8220;design patent&#8221; is 14 years measured from the grant date; the holder of a &#8220;utility patent&#8221; are required to pay maintenance fees whereas the holder of a &#8220;design patent&#8221; is not; and the holder of a &#8220;utility patent&#8221; is able to file an international application naming various countries under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), whereas the holder of a &#8220;design patent&#8221; is not. 

&#160; 

We also own the copyright in the contents of our website, the rights to the www.tropicspatan.com Internet domain name, and we guard the composition of our proprietary tanning solution as a trade secret. Other than that, we do not own any intellectual property and we have not filed for any protection of our trademark. 

&#160; 

License Agreement 

&#160;

As described elsewhere in this Report, on June 13, 2016 we completed the Notox Share Exchange and acquired 100% of the right, title and interest in and to the License Agreement with the Clinic formerly held by ZHC. The License Agreement grants us the exclusive license to certain intellectual property of the Clinic, including (i) U.S. Patent No. 8,920,816 &#8220; Apparatus and Method for Treating a Neuromuscular Defect&#8221; and associated foreign filings in various countries, (ii) improvement patents for which we elect in writing to include in the License Agreement, and (iii) foreign equivalents of any of the foregoing, and all patents issued therefrom and extensions of the same, including reissues and re-examinations. In addition, the License Agreement grants us the exclusive license to such proprietary information, trade secrets and tangible research property as is necessary to use the patent materials in the field of aesthetics and pain. Under the License Agreement, such information, secrets and property must (a) have been developed by Frank Papay, MD, (b) have been in existence as of December 1, 2012, (c) not be subject to the rights of any third parties or research sponsor restrictions, and (d) be owned by the Clinic.

&#160;

The effective date of the License Agreement is December 1, 2012, on July 30, 2013 it was amended to incorporate a revised technology timeline, and it is valid until the expiration of the last to expire of certain patents. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we are required to pay the Clinic a royalty based on the sale of certain products, a milestone payment upon first commercial sale of the first such product and a percentage of any sublicensing revenues. In the month in which our cumulative gross revenues reach a specified amount, we must reimburse the Clinic for all incurred and to be incurred patent expenses to a specified amount. Royalties and other payments are payable quarterly.

&#160;

Under the License Agreement, we are required to achieve a commercial milestone on or before November 30, 2017, and the failure to achieve this milestone, without satisfactory justification, constitutes a material breach giving the Clinic the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the License Agreement. At this time, we believe that the Clinic is open to extending the deadline for achieving the commercial milestone if circumstances warrant. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of the date of this Report, we do not have any full time or part time employees. We currently rely on the efforts of John Marmora and Zoran Konevic, our directors and principal executive officers, to manage our operations. However, we may hire workers on a contract basis from time to time as the need arises. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Recent legislation regarding sunless tanning in both the United States and Canada has consistently focused on the harm posed to consumers, and minors in particular, as a result of exposure to UV rays at indoor tanning facilities. Research indicates that high risk exposure happens more commonly in teens and that blistering sunburns and overexposure during childhood greatly increase the chances of developing skin cancer later in life. Because sun (and UV) exposure in childhood and the teenage years can be so damaging, policymakers in some states have decided to regulate minors&#8217; use of tanning devices (like tanning beds, booths and sunlamps). Currently California and Vermont ban the use of tanning beds for all minors under 18, and at least 33 states regulate the use of tanning facilities by minors. Some counties and cities also regulate the use of tanning devices. 

&#160; 

Legislators in various states and provinces are also currently debating bills that propose to ban indoor tanning for youth under the age of 18, and in some cases 14. Others have enacted laws that require in-person parental or guardian permission in order for a minor to use such facilities. Finally, most states and provinces at least require operators of indoor tanning facilities to implement time limitations on tanning beds to the manufacturer&#8217;s maximum exposure recommendation and to provide eye protection to customers. 

&#160; 

The consequence of these regulations is that consumers are effectively being legislated away from using sunless tanning products or services that involve UV light exposure, leaving a gap in the market that we are aiming to fill. The amount of negative publicity surrounding the new laws has also contributed to a search by consumers for healthy tanning alternatives that provide consistent results, and we believe we are therefore well-positioned to capture a sizeable share of the rapidly-evolving sunless tanning market. 

&#160; 

We are also required to comply with environmental laws regarding the manufacturing of our proprietary tanning solution and the recycling of the aerosol cans that contain the solution. However, we do not anticipate incurring any costs or effects relating to either since the manufacturing process required to produce our tanning solution results in no chemical by-products and minimal waste and our customers are responsible for recycling the aerosol cans through their local household recycling program. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, since our proprietary tanning solution contains DHA, it is subject to the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FD&#38;C Act&#8221;) and the purview of the FDA. Section 721 of the FD&#38;C Act authorizes the regulation of color additives, including their uses and restrictions, and DHA is listed in the regulations as a color additive for use in imparting color to the human body. However, its usage is restricted to external application, as is its use by the FDA, since the FDA has not received safety data that would allow it to consider approving DHA for use on other exposure routes such as the lips, the area of the eye or any body surface covered by a mucous membrane. This includes the use of DHA through misting tanning devices. Since it may be difficult for consumers to avoid exposure to DHA in a manner for which the chemical is not approved, we may receive requests by our customers to provide protection for their eyes and mucous membranes as part of any home mist tanning package, and we will consider such requests as the need arises. 

&#160; 

Since we are only beginning to develop the intellectual property we acquired under the License Agreement, we do not believe that any government regulations will affect our operations in that regard until we are able to complete the design of the Notox unit and treatment probe. 

&#160;
