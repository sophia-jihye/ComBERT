 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are a leading, global-branded consumer company and the world&#146;s leading commercial provider of weight management services, operating globally through a network of Company-owned and franchise operations. With over five decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we have established Weight Watchers as one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. Weight Watchers-branded products and services include meetings conducted by us and our franchisees, digital weight management products provided through our websites, mobile sites and apps, products sold at meetings, licensed products sold in retail channels and magazine subscriptions and other publications. Our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our monthly commitment plans for Weight Watchers meetings and Online subscriptions. Our &#147;meetings&#148; business refers to providing access to meetings to our monthly commitment plan subscribers, &#147;pay-as-you-go&#148; members, Total Access subscribers and other meeting members. &#147;Online&#148; refers to Weight Watchers Online, Weight Watchers Online Plus , Personal Coaching and other digital subscription products. 

Our brand enjoys high awareness and credibility among all types of weight-conscious consumers&#151;women and men, consumers online and offline, the support-inclined and the self-help-inclined. We are one of only a few commercial weight management programs whose efficacy has been clinically proven repeatedly. As the number of overweight and obese people worldwide grows, the demand for an effective, scalable and consumer-friendly weight management program increases. We believe our global presence and brand awareness uniquely position us in the global weight management market. We continue to explore different channels to access this market, including through our at-work meetings and healthcare strategic initiatives. 

We believe the unique value provided by our offerings is inspiration, accountability and support. In the more than 50 years since our founding, we have built our meetings business by helping millions of people around the world lose weight through sensible and sustainable food plans, activity, behavior modification and group support. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had approximately 1.0 million active meeting subscribers, who could attend over 32,000 Weight Watchers meetings around the world, which were run by more than 9,000 leaders&#151;each of whom lost weight on our program. We also believe we are the leading global provider of paid digital subscription weight management products. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had approximately 1.4 million active Online subscribers. Our Online business, together with its products, including apps for mobile and tablet devices, has evolved over time. Our strong brand, together with the effectiveness of our plans, loyal customer base and unparalleled network of service providers, are unique in the marketplace. 

Business Organization and Global Operations 

We have four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe (CE) and Other. Each reportable segment provides similar products and services. Further information regarding our reportable segments and our geographic areas can be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Note 15 &#147;Segment and Geographic Data&#148; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information concerning some of the risks to which we are exposed resulting from our international operations and foreign currency exchange rates is set forth in &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We operate in numerous countries around the world. Our &#147;North America&#148; reportable segment consists of our United States and Canada Company-owned operations; our &#147;United Kingdom&#148; reportable segment consists of our United Kingdom Company-owned operations; our &#147;Continental Europe&#148; reportable segment consists of our Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Sweden Company-owned operations; and 

&#160; 

our &#147;Other&#148; reportable segment consists of our Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Brazil Company-owned operations, as well as revenues and costs from our franchises in the United States and certain other countries. Revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 64.9%, 10.7%, 19.7% and 4.7%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2015. Revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 64.0%, 10.6%, 20.2% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2014. Finally, revenues from our North America, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, and Other reportable segments contributed 67.4%, 10.0%, 17.4% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total revenues in fiscal 2013. 

The Global Weight Management Market 

We participate in the global weight management market. According to Marketdata Enterprises, the weight management market had revenue of approximately $59.8 billion in 2014 in the United States alone. The number of overweight and obese adults around the world rose 27.5% between 1980 and 2013, and is estimated to reach over 3 billion by 2030. Between 2011 and 2012, 69% of Americans at or over the age of 20 were considered overweight and over a third of these were obese. Numerous diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure and Type II diabetes, are associated with being overweight or obese. 

Our Services and Products 

Our Weight Management Program and Plan 

In each of our markets, we offer services and products that are built upon our new weight management program, known as Beyond the Scale in North America. The program goes beyond a singular focus on weight loss, encompassing a holistic approach to a healthier, more active, happier life. It is comprised of a range of nutritional, activity, behavioral and lifestyle tools and approaches that can be personalized. Our new food plan, known as SmartPoints, was developed from a combination of advancements in scientific research and consumer insights, including from customers who experienced prior Weight Watchers plans. With the SmartPoints system, each food has a SmartPoints value determined by the food&#146;s calories, saturated fat, sugar and protein content. Customers following the SmartPoints system can eat any food as long as the SmartPoints value of their total food consumption stays within their personalized SmartPoints &#147;budget&#148;. Since nutritious foods generally have lower SmartPoints values, this approach guides customers toward healthier eating patterns. Based on a personalized assessment included in the Beyond the Scale program, members and subscribers get daily and weekly SmartPoints targets, personalized activity goals and relevant content tailored to their needs. Prior to the launch of SmartPoints in December 2015, we offered a weight management plan known as PointsPlus in North America, or ProPoints in certain of our other geographies. 

Our customers can participate in our program in two main ways: in-person group meetings and digitally. Within these two channels, we offer a variety of products to meet each customer&#146;s preferences. Our leaders, when leading meetings and providing personal coaching, educate members and subscribers on our program and range of tools. In addition to providing support, our leaders also inspire members and subscribers, as each leader was successful in her or his weight loss journey using our methods. 

Our Meetings Business 

In our meetings business, we present our program in regular weekly meetings of 30 to 45 minutes in duration, conveniently scheduled throughout the day. Our group support system remains the cornerstone of our meetings. Members provide each other support by sharing their experiences with, and by providing encouragement and empathy to, other people experiencing similar weight management challenges. Leaders facilitate this support through interactive meetings that encourage learning through member-driven discussions and individual goal-setting. 

&#160; 

The primary payment structure for our meetings business globally is through monthly commitment plans. Under these plans, members generally receive unlimited access to meetings at a discounted monthly price plus free access to certain Online and mobile tools and 24/7 Expert Chat, where available. Pursuant to these plans, a fee is typically charged automatically to the member&#146;s credit card or debit card on a monthly basis until the member elects to cancel. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had approximately 1.0 million active subscribers to our monthly commitment plans. We also have a &#147;pay-as-you-go&#148; arrangement for the meetings business and, in some countries, offer prepayment plans for meetings consisting of pre-paid meeting vouchers and coupons. 

In fiscal 2015, we had total meeting attendance of approximately 31.8 million, which does not include management&#146;s estimate that franchised operations had total meeting attendance of over 3.8 million. Franchisees typically pay us a fee equal to 10% of their meeting fee revenues. We have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with our franchisees over many years. In our early years, we used an aggressive franchising strategy to quickly establish a meeting infrastructure to pre-empt competition. Since then, we have acquired a large number of franchises. Our franchisees are responsible for operating classes in their franchise class territory using the program and marketing guidelines we have developed. We provide a central support system for the program and our brand. In many of our markets, franchisees purchase products from us at wholesale prices for resale directly to members. Franchisees are obligated to adhere strictly to our program content guidelines, with the freedom to control pricing, class locations, operational structure and local promotions. Franchisees provide local operational expertise, advertising and public relations. Most franchise agreements are perpetual and can be terminated only upon a material breach or bankruptcy of the franchisee. 

Our Online Business 

In our Online business, we offer various digital subscription products, including Weight Watchers Online Plus and a weight management companion for Weight Watchers meetings members who want to digitally manage the day-to-day aspects of their weight management plan. These products provide interactive and personalized resources that allow users to follow our weight management plan via the Internet or on their mobile device. In December 2014, we launched an Online subscription product, Personal Coaching, in certain of our markets, including the United States. Personal Coaching offers one-on-one telephonic, e-mail and text support and personalized planning from a Weight Watchers-certified Coach as well as access to other Online tools. 

Our Online subscription products are based on the Weight Watchers approach to weight management and provide additional tools to our meetings members, as applicable. They help subscribers adopt a healthier and more active lifestyle, with a view toward long-term behavior modification&#151;a key aspect of the Weight Watchers approach toward sustainable weight loss. These products provide subscribers with online and mobile content, functionality, resources and interactive mobile and web-based weight management plans. We believe our personalized and interactive Online subscription products give subscribers an engaging weight management experience. Our online community, which can be accessed via the web and the new Connect feature in our mobile app, gives our subscribers a way to stay virtually connected, and support and motivate each other. 

We believe that mobile weight management tools and resources are an important market opportunity for us. Our mobile phone (iPhone &#174; and Android&#153;) and iPad &#174; apps provide monthly commitment plan purchasers and Online subscribers with access to a suite of weight-loss tools, such as recipe and tracking tools, as well as other helpful content and the ability to scan the barcodes of food products for their SmartPoints values. We are continuing to improve the capabilities of our products, including integrating with popular activity-tracking devices and wireless weight scales. 

Our Product Sales 

We sell a range of products, including bars, snacks, cookbooks, food and restaurant guides with SmartPoints values, Weight Watchers magazines, SmartPoints calculators and fitness kits, and certain third-party products, such as activity-tracking monitors. These products complement our weight management program and help our 

&#160; 

customers in their weight management efforts. We have focused on selling products that drive recurring purchases. Our products are designed to be high quality, offer benefits related to the Weight Watchers program and be easy to merchandise. 

We sell our products through our meetings business, online and to our franchisees. Excluding sales to or by our franchisees, in fiscal 2015, sales of proprietary products in our meetings business and online represented approximately 11.3% of our revenues. We seek to grow our product sales per attendee in our meetings business by continuing to optimize our product offerings by updating existing products, selectively introducing new products and sharing best practices across geographies. In fiscal 2015, we launched our ecommerce platform at shop.weightwatchers.com, making the site available to all consumers, including non-members and non-subscribers. 

Licensing and Endorsements 

We license the Weight Watchers brand and our other intellectual property in certain categories of food, including frozen foods and baked goods, among others, and other relevant consumer products, including scales. We also endorse carefully selected branded consumer products. By partnering with carefully selected companies in categories relevant and helpful to weight-conscious consumers, we have created a highly profitable licensing business as well as a powerful vehicle to reinforce the Weight Watchers brand in the minds of our target consumers. 

We typically partner in our licensing and endorsement arrangements with third parties that excel at new product development and have strong marketing and sales expertise, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, financial strength, prior performance in previous licensing and endorsement deals and senior management committed to building the Weight Watchers brand. In connection with our acquisition from the H.J. Heinz Company, or Heinz, in September 1999, Heinz received a perpetual royalty-free license to continue using our brand in its core food categories. We plan to continue to choose our licensing and endorsement partners carefully after identifying and prioritizing product categories that enhance the Weight Watchers brand and have long-term growth potential. 

Our licensing and endorsement arrangements give us access to weight-conscious consumers through products sold at retail and increase the awareness of our brand. We continue to believe there are significant opportunities both in the United States and internationally to take advantage of the strength of the Weight Watchers brand and our other intellectual property through additional licensing and endorsement arrangements. 

Publishing 

Weight Watchers magazines are published in most of our major markets. In the United States, Weight Watchers Magazine is an important branded marketing platform that continues to show strong circulation and advertiser acceptance. As of fall 2015, our US magazine had a readership of over seven million, according to GfK Mediamark Research and Intelligence, LLC, an industry tracking service. We also issue other publications, such as cookbooks and food and restaurant guides with SmartPoints values, which complement our program. 

At-Work Meetings and Healthcare 

As healthcare costs continue to be a significant concern on the minds of employers and their employees, we believe that our broad range of services and products uniquely positions us to serve the corporate market and help companies reduce their healthcare costs and improve the overall well-being of their employees. Our strategy is focused on leveraging our organizational capability to serve companies of every size and type by offering convenient and flexible weight-loss solutions that include meetings at the workplace, local community meetings and access to Weight Watchers Online. 

&#160; 

We believe the healthcare market represents an important channel to reach new consumers. At the end of fiscal 2014, we announced a strategic initiative with Humana, Inc. to offer our weight management services as a part of coverage under certain employer-sponsored health plans. We continue to explore different approaches to this market. 

Our Clinical Efficacy and Reputation in the Marketplace 

Weight Watchers is one of the most clinically-studied commercial weight management programs, with dozens of peer-reviewed publications in the last 20 years. For example, in 2013, a randomized controlled trial conducted by the Baylor College of Medicine researchers and funded by us was published in The American Journal of Medicine and found that overweight and obese adults following Weight Watchers lost significantly more weight at six months than those who tried to lose weight on their own. Our efficacy and the value of our offerings are also well-acknowledged in the marketplace. For instance, in 2016, we again were recognized by U.S. News &#38; World Report in the &#147;2016 Best Diets&#148; rankings. We ranked #1 for &#147;Best Weight-Loss Diet&#148; and tied for #1 for &#147;Best Commercial Diet Plan&#148; and &#147;Easiest Diet to Follow.&#148; 

Marketing and Promotion 

Our communications with consumers and other promotional efforts enhance our brand image and awareness, and motivate both former and potential new customers to join Weight Watchers meetings or purchase our Online products. We also recently entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Oprah Winfrey, pursuant to which, among other things, Ms. Winfrey provides us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and our programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. The announcement of our partnership with Ms. Winfrey led to more than one billion earned media impressions. Further information on this agreement and our partnership with Ms. Winfrey can be found below under &#147;&#151;History&#151;Winfrey Transaction.&#148; 

We advertise primarily in national media vehicles (television, digital, print, radio, etc.), which are selected based on their efficiency and effectiveness in reaching our target audience. We develop and maintain a high level of engagement with new and potential customers on various social platforms including Facebook and Twitter. While our traditional advertising schedule generally supports the three key marketing campaigns of the year, winter, spring and fall, we communicate with consumers in the Online space in real time throughout the year. Also, we utilize brand ambassadors, including from time to time celebrity spokespersons, as part of our advertising. 

In addition to the above advertising channels, we take advantage of other channels for which we are uniquely positioned given our long history and network of leaders, members and subscribers. The word of mouth generated by our current and former customers is an important source of new customers. These referrals, combined with our strong brand and known effectiveness, enable us to attract new and returning customers. We also carry out many of our key public relations initiatives through the efforts of current and former Weight Watchers leaders, members and subscribers, including from time to time celebrities. 

Additionally, Weight Watchers Magazine reinforces the value of our brand and serves as an important marketing tool to both existing and potential customers. We also utilize mailing campaigns and the WeightWatchers.com website to attract new and returning customers and to engage current customers. 

Seasonality 

Our business is seasonal due to the importance of the winter season to our overall recruitment environment. Our advertising schedule generally supports the three key recruitment-generating seasons of the year: winter, spring and fall, with winter having the highest concentration of advertising spending. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The weight management industry includes commercial weight management programs; Internet, free mobile and other weight management apps and other electronic weight management approaches; surgical procedures; the pharmaceutical industry; self-help weight management regimens and other self-help weight management products, services and publications, such as books, magazines, websites and social media groups; dietary supplements and meal replacement products; healthy lifestyle services, products and publications; weight management services administered by doctors, nutritionists and dieticians; government agencies and non-profit groups that offer weight management services; fitness centers and national drug store chains. 

Competition among commercial weight management programs is largely based on program recognition and reputation and the effectiveness, safety and price of the program. In the United States, we compete with several other companies in the commercial weight management industry, although we believe that their businesses are not comparable to ours. For example, many of these competitors&#146; businesses are based on the sale of pre-packaged meals and meal replacements. Our meetings use group support, interactive, member-driven discussions to encourage learning and behavior modification to help our members move towards a healthier, more active, happier life with healthier eating patterns, in conjunction with a flexible food plan that allows members the freedom to choose what they eat. There are no significant group education-based competitors in any of our major markets, except in the United Kingdom. 

We believe that food manufacturers that produce meal replacement products are not comparable competition because these businesses&#146; meal replacement products do not engender behavior modification through education in conjunction with a flexible, healthy food plan. 

We also compete with various self-help diets, products, services and publications, such as free mobile and other weight management apps. Further information regarding our competition can be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

Trademarks, Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 

We own numerous domestic and international trademarks, patents and other proprietary rights that are valuable assets and are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the jurisdiction in which the patent is granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary from country to country depending upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets is important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and through domain name dispute resolution systems. 

History 

Early Development 

In 1961, Jean Nidetch, our founder, attended a New York City obesity clinic and took what she learned from her personal experience at the obesity clinic and began weight-loss meetings with a group of her overweight friends in the basement of a New York apartment building. Under Ms. Nidetch&#146;s leadership, the group members supported each other in their weight-loss efforts, and word of the group&#146;s success quickly spread. Ms. Nidetch and Al and Felice Lippert, who all successfully lost weight through these efforts, formally launched our business in 1963. Weight Watchers International, Inc. was incorporated as a Virginia corporation in 1974 and succeeded to the business started in New York in 1963. Heinz acquired us in 1978. 

&#160; 

Artal Ownership 

In September 1999, Artal Luxembourg S.A., or Artal Luxembourg, acquired us from Heinz. Artal Luxembourg is an indirect subsidiary of Artal Group S.A., or Artal Group, which together with its parents and its subsidiaries is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Artal. Currently, Artal Luxembourg is the record holder of all our shares owned by Artal. 

WeightWatchers.com Acquisition 

In July 2005, we acquired control of our licensee and affiliate, WeightWatchers.com, Inc., by increasing our ownership interest from approximately 20% to approximately 53%. Subsequently, in December 2005, WeightWatchers.com, Inc. redeemed all shares owned by Artal in it, resulting in our current ownership of 100% of WeightWatchers.com, Inc. 

Winfrey Transaction 

On October 18, 2015, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Winfrey granted us the right to use, subject to her approval, her name, image, likeness and endorsement for and in connection with the Company and its programs, products and services (including in advertising, promotion, materials and content), and we granted Ms. Winfrey the right to use our WEIGHT WATCHERS marks to collaborate with and promote the Company and its programs, products and services. The Strategic Collaboration Agreement has an initial term of five years, with additional successive one year renewal terms. During this period, Ms. Winfrey will consult with us and participate in developing, planning, executing and enhancing the Weight Watchers program and related initiatives, and provide us with services in her discretion to promote the Company and its programs, products and services, including in advertisements and promotions, and making personal appearances on our behalf. Ms. Winfrey will not grant anyone but the Company the right to use her name, image, likeness or endorsement for or in connection with any other weight loss or weight management programs during the term of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, and she will not engage in any other weight loss or weight management business, program, products, or services during the term of the Strategic Collaboration Agreement and for one year thereafter. 

On that same date, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Ms. Winfrey, or the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold to Ms. Winfrey an aggregate of 6,362,103 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of $43,198,679. The purchased shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company. Under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, Ms. Winfrey has certain demand registration rights and piggyback rights with respect to these purchased shares. The Winfrey Purchase Agreement also provides Ms. Winfrey with the right to be nominated as director of the Company for so long as she and certain permitted transferees own at least 3% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 

In consideration of Ms. Winfrey entering into the Strategic Collaboration Agreement and the performance of her obligations thereunder, on October 18, 2015, we granted Ms. Winfrey a fully vested option to purchase 3,513,468 shares of our common stock, or the Winfrey Option. The term sheet for the Winfrey Option, which includes the terms and conditions appended thereto, relating to the grant of the Winfrey Option is referred to herein as the Winfrey Option Agreement. The Winfrey Option is exercisable at a price of $6.97 per share, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 18, 2025, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances, including if (i) the Strategic Collaboration Agreement expires as a result of Ms. Winfrey&#146;s decision not to renew the term of such agreement and (ii) a change in control (as defined the Winfrey Option Agreement) of the Company occurs. The shares issuable upon exercise of the Winfrey Option are subject to certain transfer restrictions and a right of first offer and right of first refusal held by the Company. 

&#160; 

In connection with Ms. Winfrey&#146;s purchase of our common stock and the grant of the Winfrey Option described above, Artal Luxembourg entered into a Voting Agreement with Ms. Winfrey on October 18, 2015, or the Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Winfrey agreed to vote all of her common stock or preferred stock of the Company and other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any common stock or preferred stock of the Company so as to elect such individuals designated by Artal. The Voting Agreement terminates on the date that any of the following occurs: (i) Artal (and certain permitted transferees) and Ms. Winfrey (and certain permitted transferees) collectively own less than 50% of our issued and outstanding common stock, (ii) Ms. Winfrey then has the right to be nominated as a director and has met certain eligibility requirements under the Winfrey Purchase Agreement, but is not elected as a director of the Company, (iii) Ms. Winfrey (and certain permitted transferees) collectively own less than 1% of our issued and outstanding common stock, (iv) the voting and related arrangements in the Voting Agreement, in our reasonable determination, constitutes a &#147;change of control&#148; in any of our debt agreements or (v) the parties to the Voting Agreement terminate such agreement by written consent. 

As a result of entering into the Voting Agreement, Artal and Ms. Winfrey are acting as a &#147;group&#148; within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we continue to qualify as a &#147;controlled company&#148; under the applicable rules of The New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. 

The transactions contemplated by the Strategic Collaboration Agreement, Winfrey Purchase Agreement and Winfrey Option Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the Winfrey Transaction. 

Regulation 

A number of laws and regulations govern our advertising, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, licensees, franchisees, employees and other service providers and government authorities in the countries in which we operate. Certain federal, state and foreign agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulate and enforce such laws and regulations relating to advertising, promotions, packaging, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters. We are subject to many distinct employment, labor, commercial, benefits and tax laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including regulations affecting our employment and wage and hour practices and our relations with our employees and service providers. Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and taxation, are more prevalent and continue to evolve. Our operations are subject to these laws and regulations and we continue to monitor their development and our compliance. In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations in the United States and internationally. 

During the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials, claims for program success and program costs. In 1997, we entered into a consent order with the FTC settling all contested issues raised in the complaint filed against us. The consent order requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of services and products. From time to time, we have been in discussions with the FTC regarding such consent order. 

Employees and Service Providers 

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately 19,000 employees, a majority of whom were part-time employees. In addition, in certain of our markets, our service providers are self-employed and are not included in this total. We consider our relations with our employees and service providers to be satisfactory.
