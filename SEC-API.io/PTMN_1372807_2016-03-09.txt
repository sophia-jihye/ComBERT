 Item 1. Business GENERAL We are an internally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company that is regulated as a Business Development Company, or BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). We have three principal areas of investments: 

First, the Company originates, structures, and invests in senior secured term loans and mezzanine debt primarily in privately-held middle market companies (the &#147;Debt Securities Portfolio&#148;). In addition, from time to time the Company may invest in the equity securities of privately held middle market companies. 

Second, the Company has invested in asset management companies (Katonah Debt Advisors and Trimaran Advisors, collectively the &#147;Asset Manager Affiliates&#148;) that manage collateralized loan obligation funds (&#147;CLO Funds&#148;). 

Third, the Company invests in debt and subordinated securities issued by CLOs (&#147;CLO Fund Securities&#148;). These CLO Fund Securities are primarily managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, but from time-to-time the Company makes investments in CLO Fund Securities managed by other asset managers. The CLO Funds typically invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. 

The Company may also invest in other investments such as loans to larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. The Company may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with its debt investments. 

In our Debt Securities Portfolio, our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation from the investments in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments in privately-held middle market companies. We define the middle market as comprising companies with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;) of $10 million to $50 million and/or total debt of $25 million to $150 million. We primarily invest in first and second lien term loans which, because of their priority in a company&#146;s capital structure, we expect will have lower default rates and higher rates of recovery of principal if there is a default and which we expect will create a stable stream of interest income. The investments in our Debt Securities Portfolio are all or predominantly below investment grade, and have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer&#146;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. While our primary investment focus is on making loans to, and selected equity investments in, privately-held middle market companies, we may also invest in other investments such as loans to smaller companies or larger, publicly-traded companies, high-yield bonds and distressed debt securities. We may also receive warrants or options to purchase common stock in connection with our debt investments. 

From our Asset Manager Affiliates investment, we expect to receive recurring cash distributions and generate capital appreciation through the addition of new CLO Funds managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates. We may also seek to monetize our investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates if and when business conditions warrant. The Asset Manager Affiliates manage CLO Funds that invest in broadly syndicated loans, high-yield bonds and other credit instruments. The Asset Manager Affiliates are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;), and are each managed independently from KCAP by a separate management team (however, certain of the Company&#146;s executive officers also act in similar capacities for one or both of the Asset Manager Affiliates). 

In addition, our investments in CLO Fund Securities, which are primarily made up of minority investments in the subordinated securities or preferred stock of CLO Funds raised and managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, are anticipated to provide the Company with recurring cash distributions and complement the growth of our investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates. 

Because we are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors and do not depend on a third party investment advisor, we do not pay investment advisory fees, but instead incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The 1940 Act also generally prohibits us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock if our asset coverage is below 200% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution. 

Subject to market conditions, we intend to grow our portfolio of assets by raising additional capital, including through the prudent use of leverage available to us. Because we also recognize the need to have funds available for operating our business and to make investments, we seek to have adequate liquidity at all times to cover normal cyclical swings in funding availability and to allow us to meet abnormal and unexpected funding requirements. As a result, we may hold varying amounts of cash and other short-term investments from time-to-time for liquidity purposes. 

We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;) and intend to operate in a manner to maintain our RIC tax treatment. Accordingly, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary tax-basis taxable income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet the specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute to our stockholders annually at least 90% of our net ordinary tax-basis taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each year. 

We were formed in August 2006, as Kohlberg Capital Corporation. In December 2006, we completed our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), which raised net proceeds of approximately $200 million after the exercise of the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option. In connection with our IPO, we issued an additional 3,484,333 shares of our common stock in exchange for the ownership interests of Katonah Debt Advisors and certain CLO Fund Securities. 

In April 2008, the Company completed a rights offering that resulted in the issuance of 3.1 million shares of our common stock, and net proceeds of $27 million. 

On February 29, 2012, the Company purchased Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C. (&#147;Trimaran Advisors&#148;), a CLO manager similar to Katonah Debt Advisors, L.L.C. (&#147;Katonah Debt Advisors&#148;), with assets under management of approximately $1.5 billion, for total consideration of $13.0 million in cash and 3,600,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. Contemporaneous with the acquisition of Trimaran Advisors, the Company acquired from Trimaran Advisors equity interests in certain CLO Funds managed by Trimaran Advisors for an aggregate purchase price of $12.0 million in cash. As of December 31, 2015, the Asset Manager Affiliates had approximately $2.7 billion of par value assets under management. 

On July 11, 2012, we changed our name from Kohlberg Capital Corporation to KCAP Financial, Inc. 

On February 14, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of 5,232,500 shares of common stock, which included the underwriters&#146; full exercise of their option to purchase up to 682,500 shares of common stock, at a price of $9.75 per share, raising approximately $51.0 million in gross proceeds. In conjunction with this offering, the Company also sold 200,000 shares of common stock to a member of its Board of Directors, at a price of $9.31125 per share, raising approximately $1.9 million in gross proceeds. 

On October 6, 2014, the Company priced a follow-on public offering of 3.0 million shares of its common stock at a price of $8.02 per share. The offering raised net proceeds of approximately $23.8 million, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. 

Including employees of our Asset Manager Affiliates, we employ an experienced team of 18 investment professionals and 23 total staff members. Dayl W. Pearson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and one of our directors, has been in the financial services industry for over 39 years. During the past 25 years, Mr. Pearson has focused almost exclusively on the middle market and has originated, structured and underwritten over $7 billion of debt and equity securities. R. Jon Corless, our Chief Investment Officer with primary responsibility for the Debt Securities Portfolio, has managed investment portfolios in excess of 

&#160;

&#160;

$4 billion at several institutions and has been responsible for managing portfolios of leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, mezzanine securities and middle market loans. Dominick J. Mazzitelli is the President and portfolio manager of the Asset Manager Affiliates. He has over 20 years of experience within the credit markets, with most of his career focused on the leveraged finance markets. Edward U. Gilpin, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, has been in financial services for over 30 years, with significant experience in overseeing the financial operations and reporting for asset management businesses, including the fair value accounting of CLO securities owned by them. 

Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X and the Financial Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 946, Financial Services &#151; Investment Companies (ASC 946), we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the portfolio company is another investment company. An exception to this general principle in ASC 946 occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us, or to an investment company of ours. Other than KCAP Funding, Kohlberg Capital Funding I LLC, KCAP Senior Funding I Holdings LLC and KCAP Senior Funding I LLC, none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception. Therefore, our portfolio investments, including our investments in the Asset Manager Affiliates, are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as &#147;Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)&#148; in our statement of operations until the investment is exited, at which point any gain or loss on exit is reclassified and recognized as a &#147;Net Realized Gain (Loss) from Investments.&#148; 

Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#147;KCAP.&#148; The net asset value per share of our common stock at December 31, 2015 was $5.82. On December 31, 2015, the last reported sale price of a share of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market was $4.07. In addition, our 7.375% notes due 2019 (&#147;7.375% Notes Due 2019&#148;) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;KAP.&#148; 

Our Corporate Information Our principal executive offices are located at 295 Madison Avenue, 6 th Floor, New York, New York 10017, and our telephone number is (212) 455-8300. We maintain a website on the Internet at http://www.kcapfinancial.com . The information contained in our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 

Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio generates investment income, which is generally used to pay principal and interest on our borrowings, operating expenses, and to fund our distributions to our stockholders. Our investment portfolio consists of three primary components: the Debt Securities Portfolio, the CLO Fund Securities and our investment in our wholly owned Asset Manager Affiliates. 

Debt Securities Portfolio. We target privately-held middle market companies that have strong historical cash flows, experienced management teams and identifiable and defendable market positions in industries with positive dynamics. We generally target companies that generate positive cash flows because we look to cash flows as the primary source for servicing debt. 

We employ a disciplined approach in the selection and monitoring of our investments. Generally, we target investments that will generate a current return through interest income to provide for stability in our shareholder distributions and place less reliance on realized capital gains from our investments. Our investment philosophy is focused on preserving capital with an appropriate return profile relative to risk. Our investment due diligence and selection generally focuses on an underlying issuer&#146;s net cash flow after capital expenditures to service its debt rather than on multiples of net income, valuations or other broad benchmarks which frequently miss the nuances of an issuer&#146;s business and prospective financial performance. We also generally avoid concentrations in any one industry or issuer. We manage risk by following our internal credit policies and procedures. 

&#160;

&#160;

When we extend senior and junior secured term loans, we will generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. Nonetheless, there is a possibility that our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. Structurally, mezzanine debt ranks subordinate in priority of payment to senior term loans and is often unsecured. Relative to equity, mezzanine debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in a borrower&#146;s capital structure. Typically, mezzanine debt has elements of both debt and equity instruments, offering the fixed returns in the form of interest payments associated with a loan, while providing an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation of a borrower, if any, through an equity interest that is typically in the form of equity purchased at the time the mezzanine loan is repaid or warrants to purchase equity at a future date at a fixed cost. Mezzanine debt generally earns a higher return than senior secured debt due to its higher risk profile and usually less restrictive covenants. The warrants associated with mezzanine debt are typically detachable, which allows lenders to receive repayment of their principal on an agreed amortization schedule while retaining an equity interest in the borrower. Mezzanine debt also may include a &#147;put&#148; feature, which permits the holder to sell its equity interest back to the borrower at a price determined through an agreed formula. 

Below are summary attributes for our Debt Securities Portfolio as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015:

&#149; represented approximately 69% of total investment portfolio; &#149; contained credit instruments issued by corporate borrowers; &#149; primarily comprised of senior secured and junior secured loans (68% and 13% of debt securities, respectively); &#149; spread across 26 different industries and 87 different entities; &#149; average par balance per investment of approximately $3.3 million; &#149; all but 1 issuer (representing less than 1% of amortized cost of total investments) were current on their debt service obligations; and &#149; weighted average interest rate of 7.4% on income producing debt investments. Our investments generally average between $1 million to $20 million, although particular investments may be larger or smaller. The size of individual investments will vary according to their priority in a company&#146;s capital structure, with larger investments in more secure positions in an effort to maximize capital preservation. The size of our investments and maturity dates may vary as follows:

&#149; senior secured term loans from $2 to $20 million maturing in five to seven years; &#149; second lien term loans from $5 to $15 million maturing in six to eight years; &#149; senior unsecured loans from $5 to $23 million maturing in six to eight years; &#149; mezzanine loans from $5 to $15 million maturing in seven to ten years; and &#149; equity investments from $1 to $5 million. Asset Manager Affiliates. We expect to receive recurring cash distributions and seek to generate capital appreciation from our investment in our Asset Manager Affiliates. We may also seek to monetize our investment the Asset Manager Affiliates if and when business conditions warrant. As a manager of the CLO Funds, our Asset Manager Affiliates receive contractual and recurring management fees from the CLO Funds for their management and advisory services. In addition, our Asset Manager Affiliates may also earn income related to net interest on assets accumulated for future CLO issuances on which they have provided a first loss guaranty in connection with loan warehouse arrangements for their CLO Funds. 

The annual management fees that our Asset Manager Affiliates receive are generally based on a fixed percentage of the par value of assets under management and are recurring in nature for the term of the CLO Fund, so long as the Asset Manager Affiliate manages the fund. As a result, the management fees earned by our Asset Manager Affiliates are not subject to market value fluctuations in the underlying collateral. The 

&#160;

&#160;

management fees that our Asset Manager Affiliates receive generally have three contractual components: a senior management fee, a subordinated management fee and the possibility of an incentive management fee if certain conditions are met. Currently, all CLO Funds managed by the Asset Manager Affiliates are paying both their senior and subordinated management fees on a current basis. During 2015, three CLO Funds have achieved the minimum investment return threshold and our Asset Manager Affiliates received incentive fees from those CLO Funds. 

Subject to the conditions of the capital markets, we expect to continue to make investments in CLO Funds managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, which we believe will provide us with a current cash investment return. We believe that these investments will provide our Asset Manager Affiliates with greater opportunities to access new sources of capital, which will ultimately increase our Asset Manager Affiliates&#146; assets under management and resulting management fee income. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; for a discussion of the risks relating to our ability to access the capital markets and the impact of certain risk retention rules which require that we or our Asset Manager Affiliates make and maintain certain minimum investments in CLO Funds managed by the Asset Manager Affiliates. 

The after-tax net free cash flow that our Asset Manager Affiliates generate through the fees they receive for managing CLO Funds and after paying their expenses pursuant to an overhead allocation agreement with the Company associated with their operations, including compensation of their employees, may be distributed to us. Distributions from our Asset Manager Affiliates&#146; tax basis earnings and profits are recorded as &#147;Dividends From Asset Manager Affiliates&#148; in our financial statements when declared. From time to time our Asset Manager Affiliates may distribute cash in excess of tax basis earnings and profits. This excess is deemed a return of capital (&#147;ROC&#148;) and is recorded in &#147;unrealized gains (losses)&#148; on the statement of operations. 

Below are summary attributes for our Asset Manager Affiliates, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015:

&#149; represented approximately 14% of total investment portfolio; &#149; had approximately $2.7 billion par value of assets under management; &#149; receive contractual and recurring asset management fees based on par value of managed investments; &#149; may receive an incentive management fee from a CLO Fund, provided that the CLO Fund achieves a minimum designated return on investment. In 2015, three such funds paid incentive fees to our Asset Manager Affiliates; &#149; distributions paid by our Asset Manager Affiliates are an additional source of income to pay our distributions to our stockholders and service our debt obligations; and &#149; for the year ended December 31, 2015, we received cash distributions of approximately $9.1 million, of which $5.3 million was recognized as investment income from our Asset Manager Affiliates and the remaining amount as a return of capital. CLO Fund Securities. Subject to the conditions of the capital markets, we expect to continue to make investments in the CLO Funds managed by our Asset Manager Affiliates, which we believe will provide us with a current cash investment return. We believe that these investments will provide our Asset Manager Affiliates with greater opportunities to access new sources of capital which will ultimately increase our Asset Manager Affiliates&#146; assets under management and resulting management fee income. 

Below are summary attributes for our CLO Fund Securities, as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2015, unless otherwise specified:

&#149; CLO Fund Securities represented approximately 14% of total investment portfolio at December 31, 2015; &#149; 98% of CLO Fund Securities represented investments in subordinated securities or equity securities issued by CLO Funds and 2% of CLO Fund Securities was a rated note; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; all CLO Funds invested primarily in credit instruments issued by corporate borrowers; &#149; GAAP-basis investment income of $15.7 million; cash distributions received of approximately $24.9 million (approximately $14.7 million taxable distributable income). Structure and Process Structure We are an internally managed BDC with 24 full-time employees (inclusive of employees of our Asset Manager Affiliates). The following are our key functional teams that execute our business strategy:

&#149; Our BDC investment team consists of 7 professionals who originate, structure, and invest in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity securities primarily in privately-held middle market companies as well as CLO Funds. &#149; Our Asset Manager Affiliates team consists of 8 professionals who structure, purchase and manage portfolios of primarily broadly syndicated corporate senior debt for CLOs. &#149; The remainder of the employees include senior management, operations, financial accounting, compliance and human resources. Process KCAP will review potential investment opportunities and conduct due diligence that will typically include a review of historical and prospective financial information, participation in a presentation held by the prospective portfolio company&#146;s management and/or the transaction sponsor, a review of the prospective portfolio company&#146;s product or service, an analysis and understanding of the drivers of the particular industry in which the prospective portfolio company operates, and an assessment of the debt service capabilities of the prospective portfolio company under a variety of assumed forecast scenarios. 

Due to our ability to source transactions through multiple channels, we expect to continue to maintain a pipeline of opportunities to allow comparative risk return analysis and selectivity. By focusing on the drivers of revenue and cash flow, we develop our own underwriting cases, and multiple stress and event specific case scenarios for each company analyzed. 

We focus on lending and investing opportunities in:

&#149; companies with EBITDA of $10 to $50 million; &#149; companies with financing needs of $25 to $150 million; &#149; companies purchased by well-regarded private equity sponsors; &#149; non-sponsored companies with successful management and systems; &#149; high-yield bonds and broadly syndicated loans to larger companies on a selective basis; and &#149; equity co-investment in companies where we see substantial opportunity for capital appreciation. We expect to continue to source investment opportunities from:

&#149; private equity sponsors; &#149; regional investment banks for non-sponsored companies; &#149; other middle market lenders with whom we can participate in loans; and &#149; our Asset Manager Affiliates, with regard to high-yield bonds and syndicated loans. In our experience, good credit judgment is based on a thorough understanding of both the qualitative and quantitative factors that determine a company&#146;s performance. Our analysis begins with an understanding of the fundamentals of the industry in which a company operates, including the current economic environment and the outlook for the industry. We also focus on the company&#146;s relative position within the industry and its historical ability to weather economic cycles. Other key qualitative factors include the experience and depth of the management team and the financial sponsor, if any. 

&#160;

&#160;

Only after we have a comprehensive understanding of the qualitative factors do we focus on quantitative metrics. We believe that with the context provided by the qualitative analysis, we can gain a better understanding of a company&#146;s financial performance. We analyze a potential portfolio company&#146;s sales growth and margins in the context of its competition as well as its ability to manage its working capital requirements and its ability to generate consistent cash flow. Based upon this historical analysis, we develop a set of projections which represents a reasonable underwriting case of most likely outcomes for the company over the period of our investment. We also look at potential downside cases to determine a company&#146;s ability to service its debt in a stressed credit environment. 

Elements of the qualitative analysis we use in evaluating investment opportunities include the following:

&#149; industry fundamentals; &#149; competitive position and market share; &#149; past ability to work through historical down-cycles; &#149; quality of financial and technology infrastructure; &#149; sourcing risks and opportunities; &#149; labor and union strategy; &#149; technology risk; &#149; diversity of customer base and product lines; &#149; quality of financial sponsor (if applicable); and &#149; acquisition and integration history. Elements of the quantitative analysis we use in evaluating investment opportunities include the following:

&#149; income statement analysis of growth and margin trends; &#149; cash flow analysis of capital expenditures and free cash flow; &#149; financial ratio and market share standing among comparable companies; &#149; financial projections: underwriting versus stress case; &#149; event specific credit modeling; &#149; credit profile trend; &#149; future capital expenditure needs and asset sale plans; &#149; downside protection to limit losses in an event of default; &#149; risk adjusted returns and relative value analysis; and &#149; enterprise and asset valuations. The origination, structuring and credit approval processes are fully integrated. Our credit team is directly involved in all due diligence and analysis prior to the formal credit approval process by the Investment Committee. 

Investment Committee The Investment Committee consists of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Investment Officer, and an additional member of the Board of Directors. The Investment Committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. 

Upon completion of the due diligence investigation, the underwriting team of investment professionals/analysts will prepare a credit underwriting memorandum that will summarize the contemplated transaction, present the investment highlights, analyze the risk in the transaction and mitigating factors to those risks, 

&#160;

&#160;

analyze the prospective portfolio&#146;s historical financial statements, financial projections, industry and management team, and will then present this memorandum with its recommendations to the Investment Committee for review and approval. 

The approval of a majority of the Investment Committee will be required for all investments of less than $15 million, and the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee will be required for investments of $15 million or greater. 

Monitoring Our management team has significant experience monitoring credit portfolios. Along with origination and credit analysis, portfolio management is one of the key elements of our business. Most of our investments will not be liquid and, therefore, we must prepare to act quickly if potential issues arise so that we can work closely with management and the private equity sponsor, if applicable, of the portfolio company to take any necessary remedial action. In addition, most of our senior management team, including the credit team at the Asset Manager Affiliates, has substantial workout and restructuring experience. 

In order to assist us in detecting issues with our Debt Securities Portfolio companies as early as possible, we perform a financial analysis at least quarterly on each portfolio company. This analysis typically includes:

&#149; A summary of the portfolio company&#146;s current total credit exposure as well as the KCAP portion of this exposure. &#149; A summary and update of the portfolio company&#146;s financial condition and performance, including but not limited to, performance versus plan, deterioration/improvement in market position, or industry fundamentals, management changes or additions, and ongoing business strategy. &#149; Reaffirmation of, or proposal to change, the risk rating of the underlying investment. &#149; A summary of the portfolio company&#146;s financial covenant results vis a vis financial covenant levels established in the credit agreement. Watch list credits are followed closely and discussed periodically with the Chief Investment Officer, as appropriate. 

&#160;

&#160;

DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock quarterly. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. 

Our net asset value per share was $5.82 and $6.94 as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Since we report our assets at fair value for each reporting period, net asset value also represents the amount of stockholders&#146; equity per share for the reporting period. Our net asset value is comprised mostly of investment assets less debt and other liabilities:

(1) Our balance sheet at fair value and resultant net asset value are calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Our per share presentation of such amounts (other than net asset value per share) is an internally derived non-GAAP performance measure calculated by dividing the applicable balance sheet amount by outstanding shares. We believe that the per share amounts for such balance sheet items are helpful in analyzing our balance sheet both quantitatively and qualitatively. (2) Includes restricted cash held under employee benefit plans. (3) Consists of cash held for quarterly interest and principal payments to the holders of notes Issued by KCAP Senior Funding I, LLC. Valuation As a BDC, we invest primarily in illiquid securities, including loans to and warrants of private companies and interests in other illiquid securities, such as interests in CLO Fund Securities. These portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale and will generally have no established trading market. As a result, our Board of Directors determines in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy developed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (&#147;ASC 820: Fair Value&#148;), and a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio. Our Board of Directors is ultimately and solely responsible for making a good faith determination of the fair value of portfolio investments on a quarterly basis. The Company uses an independent valuation firm to provide third party valuation consulting services to the Company and the Board of Directors. For additional information concerning valuation, see

Competition Our primary competitors also provide financing to prospective portfolio companies. These include commercial banks, specialty finance companies, hedge funds, structured investment funds, other BDCs and investment banks. Our competitors may have a lower cost of funds, and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us. Many of these entities have greater managerial resources than we have, and the 1940 Act imposes certain regulatory restrictions on us as a BDC to which many of our competitors are not subject. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#151; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.&#148; 

We believe that we provide a unique combination of an experienced middle market loan origination and a CLO management platform at the Asset Manager Affiliates that includes experienced lenders with broad industry expertise. We believe that this combination of resources provides us with a thorough credit process and multiple sources of investment opportunities that make us attractive within our market. 

Employees As of December 31, 2015, we and our Asset Manager Affiliates had 24 employees, including an experienced team of 15 investment professionals. 

REGULATION The following discussion is a general summary of some of the material prohibitions and restrictions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all the laws and regulations affecting BDCs. 

A BDC is a unique kind of investment company that primarily focuses on investing in or lending to private or relatively small publicly traded companies and making managerial assistance available to them. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their directors and officers and certain other related persons and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#147;interested persons,&#148; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. We have implemented certain procedures to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us. 

In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of such company&#146;s shares present at a meeting or represented by proxy if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company. 

Qualifying Assets Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, or &#147;Qualifying Assets,&#148; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, Qualifying Assets represent at least 70% of the company&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of Qualifying Assets relevant to our business are the following: 

&#149; Securities of an &#147;eligible portfolio company&#148; purchased in transactions not involving any public offering. An &#147;eligible portfolio company&#148; is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: (a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; (b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

&#160;

&#160;

(c) satisfies any of the following: (i) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange (or, if it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million); (ii) is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; (iii) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; or (iv) does not have outstanding any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit. &#149; Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control; &#149; Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company and is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization; &#149; Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the conversion of warrants or rights relating to such securities; and &#149; Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. Significant Managerial Assistance A BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. In addition, BDCs must generally offer to make available to such issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons is the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company&#146;s officers or other organizational or financial guidance. 

Temporary Investments Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that at least 70% of our assets are &#147;qualifying assets.&#148; Typically, we invest in U.S. treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements that are treated, under applicable tax rules, as being issued by a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests imposed on us by the Code to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements treated as issued, under applicable tax rules, by a single counterparty in excess of this limit. We monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

&#160;

&#160;

Indebtedness; Coverage Ratio We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, with respect to certain types of senior securities, we must make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of certain of our securities, unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with the resulting leverage, see &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Business and Structure &#151; We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.&#148; As of December 31, 2015, our asset coverage ratio was 202%, above the minimum required asset coverage level of 200%. 

Common Stock We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such common stock (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.&#148; 

Code of Ethics We adopted and maintain a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#146;s requirements. A copy of the code of ethics is available on the Corporate Governance section of the Company&#146;s website at http://www.kcapfinancial.com . Our code of ethics may also be reviewed and copied at the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Copies of the code of ethics may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov , or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102. In addition, our code of ethics is available on the SEC&#146;s website at http://www.sec.gov . 

Privacy Principles We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although some non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as is necessary to service stockholder accounts, such as to a transfer agent, or as otherwise permitted by law. 

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to our employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 

&#160;

&#160;

Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures Although the securities we hold are not typically voting securities, some of our investments could entitle us to voting rights. If this were to occur we would vote our portfolio securities in the best interest of our stockholders and we would review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we would generally vote against proposals that we believe may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if we were to believe there exists a compelling long-term reason to do so. 

Our voting decisions would be made by our Investment Committee. To ensure that our vote would not the product of a conflict of interest, we would require that (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Other We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from indemnifying any director or officer against any liability to our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have a designated Chief Compliance Officer who is responsible for administering these policies and procedures. 

TAXATION AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Regulated Investment Company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and intend to operate in a manner to maintain our RIC tax treatment. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which is generally our net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

Taxation as a RIC For any taxable year in which we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any net ordinary income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (c) any income or gains realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been 

&#160;

&#160;

distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). Although we generally endeavor to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may incur a U.S. federal excise tax. 

To qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

&#149; qualify to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income) (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and &#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#186; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#186; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). If we do not satisfy the requirements of the Diversification Tests as of the end of any quarter, we will not lose our status as RIC provided that (i) we satisfied the requirements in a prior quarter and (ii) our failure to satisfy the requirements in the current quarter is not due in whole or in part to an acquisition of any security or other property. 

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities. 

Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. If we are not able to obtain sufficient cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on all of our taxable income without the benefit of the dividends-paid deduction. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order (i) to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to otherwise eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income and excise taxes and (ii) to satisfy the Diversification Tests. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to borrow additional funds or to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless a certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; test is met. See &#147;Regulation &#151; Indebtedness; Coverage Ratio.&#148; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests may be limited by (a) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (b) other requirements relating to our qualification as 

&#160;

&#160;

a RIC. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, or the Diversification Tests, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (a) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (b) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (c) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (d) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (e) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (f) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (g) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (h) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (i) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may hold assets that generate such income and provide services that generate such fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not &#147;opted out&#148; of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash. 

No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have such shareholder&#146;s cash distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than ten days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant&#146;s account, issue a certificate registered in the participant&#146;s name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. 

Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 

We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market on the dividend payment date. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on The NASDAQ Global Select Market or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator of the dividend 

&#160;

&#160;

reinvestment plan will be allocated to a stockholder based upon the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased with respect to the distribution. 

There are no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan administrator&#146;s fees under the plan are paid by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant&#146;s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds. 

If your distributions are reinvested, you will be required to pay tax on the distributions in the same manner as if the distributions were received in cash. The taxation of distributions will not be affected by the form in which you receive them. 

Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the plan administrator via its website at www.amstock.com , by filling out the transaction request form located at bottom of their statement and sending it to the plan administrator at the address set forth below or by calling the plan administrator at 1-866-668-8564. 

The plan may be terminated by us upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to, and additional information about the plan may be obtained from, the plan administrator by mail at American Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, Attn. Dividend Reinvestment Department, P.O. Box 922, Wall Street Station, New York, NY 10269-0560 or by telephone at 1-866-668-8564.
