 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on August 12, 2010, and from that time until December 28, 2011, we were a &#8220;blank check&#8221; company under the securities laws, meaning that our sole business plan was to merge with or be acquired by an operating business. On December 28, 2011, we merged with Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc., effecting the acquisition of our current business and changed our name from &#8220;Daedalus Ventures, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc.

&#160;

On March 28, 2011, William Tay, then our sole officer, director and stockholder, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Daedalus Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was a private company which would in the future merge with us. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Tay offered and sold 31,390,000 (then all the issued and outstanding) shares of common stock of the Company to the Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc., which was then controlled by Eleazar Rivera, our current sole officer and director, and majority stockholder, and Neil Edwards, a holder of approximately 29.9% of our shares of common stock.

&#160;

Under the terms and conditions of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 1, 2011, by and between the Company (then named &#8220;Daedalus Ventures, Inc.&#8221;) and Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc., a Delaware corporation, the Company sold 75,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares of Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. The merger was not consummated until, December 28, 2011, when a Certificate of Merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, effecting the acquisition of our current business and changed our name from &#8220;Daedalus Ventures, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. The effect of the merger and the private stock transaction between William Tay and Eleazar Rivera was that the stockholders of Alpha Network Alliance Ventures Inc. held 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at the time of merger, with Eleazar. Rivera maintaining control of the business.

&#160;

We are a development stage company, had revenues of $56,924 at December 31, 2015. The revenues are cost of goods sold and are receivables. At December 31, 2015, we have total assets of $65,862.

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Since March 2011 we have been, and presently are, engaged in the development of a social networking website, www.kababayanko.com, for overseas workers from the Philippines and others who share or are interested in their lifestyle. Our fiscal year end is December 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our social networking website aims to provide overseas workers from the Philippines with a platform to share their overseas working and living experiences, and interact with a community of Filipino overseas workers from around the world. The address of our principal executive office is 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505. Our telephone number is (888) 770-5084. We have a website located at www.kababayanko.com

&#160;

Eleazar Rivera has served as our President, Secretary, Treasurer and a Director from March 29, 2011, until the current date. Our board of directors is comprised of one person: Eleazar Rivera

&#160;

We are authorized to issue 8,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 2,000,000,000 shares of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share.

&#160;

We operate a social networking website that focuses on building online communities of overseas workers from the Philippines. Our website, www.kababayanko.com, enables overseas workers from the Philippines and others who share or are interested in their lifestyle to chat, post pictures and videos, share experiences and make voice calls. Our website, www.kababayanko.com, is accessible, was publicly launched in May 2012, has approximately 100 members and approximately 13,700 &#8220;likes&#8221; on Facebook. kababayanko.com is enabled to allow members and visitors to select a display our website in Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano and other languages of the Philippines, English, Chinese and other languages.

&#160;

We plan to generate revenues through the sale of our premium package services, which allows members of other popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to join our website with their current username without the need to register as new members on our website, at a cost of $12.50 to $125.00 per year and (ii) advertising space on our website.

&#160;

We plan to focus our efforts on driving visitors to our website by promoting our website with Google Adwords and making our website more accessible to visitors from other social networks such as Facebook and Twitter and by adding language translations to foreign visitors. We will also attempt to generate revenues by negotiating agreements with third-party merchants to display their goods on our site and pay us a commission if our visitors purchase their products. We have identified some merchants who currently offer their products through our online store, but plan to identify and enter into selling arrangements more merchants, though there can be no assurance that we will be able to once we reach this stage in our business development.

&#160;

Provided we raise sufficient proceeds from the offering, although there can be no assurance at the present time, we expect to start generating revenues within 4 to 6 months following launch.

&#160;

We are in the early stage of our business plan. We currently have little revenues and few premium members of our website. Our activities to date have been limited to organizational matters, development of our business plan, development of our website, and efforts related to becoming a publicly traded company.

&#160;

Our offices are currently located at 11801 Pierce St., 2nd Floor, Riverside, California 92505.

&#160; 

SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES, GENERALLY 

&#160;

Social networking websites provide internet users with services that allow them to form, join, or participate in online communities and to communicate with others regarding common interests and pursuits. Social networking websites have experienced increasing popularity in the last decade, and many sites have grown into broad networks encompassing tens of millions of users. Our management believes that the popularity of general interest social networking sites, such as Facebook, has opened the door for more specialized and exclusive services that cater to special interest groups.

&#160;

&#160;

OUR WEBSITE 

&#160;

We have acquired web hosting space for our website at the cost of approximately $500 per month. Our website, at www.kababayanko.com is accessible and fully operational. To date our website has the following functions and services:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Member Profiles: Subscribers can customize their profile pages with their own design, using profile applications, and may choose to make their profile public or private to other subscribers; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Photos and Videos: Subscribers can upload and share photos and videos; &#160;

We have developed our own voice calling and karaoke modules and platforms through the use of independent contractor software programmers, which became operational for our members in August 2012. A have a connection from the data center from our website, www. kababayanko.com to the main data center of our telecom data center.

&#160; 

EBID SERVICES 

&#160;

Our EBID services allow our members to open their own online stores on our website where they can sell items, receive payments, and manage the appearance of their store fronts, as they appear on our website.

&#160;

We operate our EBID services by allowing our members to list items for sale to be purchased immediately, for sale to this highest bidder, or both. We plan to generate revenues through this service by charging sellers who use it a 10% sales commission for each item sold. Our members who use our EBID services can enter a length (in days) to list an item for sale, upload photos, categorize, set a price for immediate purchase (and bidding reserve), enter item location, provide a description, and purchase listing enhancements like bold, italic, highlighted, and/or pay to feature their listing. The item will be active until the time expires or until the quantity is sold, whichever comes first. While the item is being offered for sale, other site prospective purchasers will be able to either bid on the item or immediately purchase the item. After a purchaser has decided to purchase an item(s) with by way of bid, or when they are checking out by way of immediate purchase, our EBID services will ask the purchaser of the item for shipping information, any item configuration options, and direct to pay the seller. Payments are made by the purchase of the item through a gateway on our website. Once a purchaser has made payment, we charge the seller a 10% sales commission which we retain, and 90% of the sales price is directed to the seller.

&#160;

We have never declared bankruptcy, never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor have we been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. Neither the Company, nor our officers, directors, promoters or affiliates, has had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.

&#160; 

REVENUE MODEL 

&#160;

PREMIUM PACKAGE SERVICES 

&#160;

Visitors to our website are able review posts and search general sections of the website for free. However, members are charged $12.50 to $125.00 per year if they would like to use our premium package services, which includes advertising, selling goods and services on our market place, VOIP calling and, in approximately August 2012, karaoke features. The extra features available to subscribers of our premium package services will include the ability to start a personal blog on our website, for example.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ADVERTISEMENT SPACE 

&#160;

One of the major benefits of advertising on a social networking site is that advertisers can take advantage of the users&#8217; demographic information and target their ads appropriately. We intend to sell advertisement space to companies who are interested in targeting our subscribers. We anticipate that interested advertisers will include (i) money remittance agencies targeting overseas Filipino workers, (ii) real estate agencies in the Philippines targeting overseas Filipino workers who intend to purchase real estate upon their return to the Philippines, (iii) merchants in the Philippines targeting overseas Filipino workers who purchase gifts for delivery to their families in the Philippines, (iv) employers recruiting Filipinos to work outside of the Philippines, and (v) suppliers of lifestyle products and services catering to our target market. We intend to sell advertising space on our website, through Connection Junction at a rate of $0.15 per click of an ad appearing on the website. Advertisements will appear on all of our web pages in a vertically oriented sidebar or in banners across the webpage.

&#160;

Additionally, we intend in the future to participate in the Google AdSense service. Google AdSense is a free service, which displays text-only ads that correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown. Each time a user of a host website clicks on an AdSense advertisement, Google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser. We were experimenting with the integration of &#8220;dummy&#8221; advertisements by Google with our social network website, and we have since removed these advertisements. We have not yet applied to Google AdSense program but do intend to do so once our website has been publicly launched. We did not generate any AdSense related income and since Google pays a different fee rate according to the niche your website occupies, we do not yet know what this fee will be.

&#160; 

SALE OF THIRD-PARTY GOODS 

&#160;

We plan to offer our members a marketplace service to sell goods, such as, clothes, handbags and fashion accessories. We will display on our website ads to items that are available for purchase, these ads will be linked to the merchant&#8217;s store, once a member of our site clicks on it he will be redirected to the merchant&#8217;s store to complete the purchase, once the sale is completed we will be paid a commission by the merchant. We have not yet identified potential merchants, with the exception of several selling handbags and clothing.

&#160; 

COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY 

&#160;

The social networking website industry is highly competitive and, at times, subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition is generally a function of the website&#8217;s brand strength and the success of its marketing strategies, its user capacity and reliability, and its ability to accommodate and integrate evolving technology and features (such as smart-phone or Twitter compatibility, for example). Additionally, with regard to the online retail component of our business, competition is generally a function of the assortment and continuity of merchandise selection offered, reliable order fulfillment and delivery, and the level of brand support for products offered.

&#160;

We will be required to compete with a large number of niche social networking and merchandising websites, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products and services similar to (and competitive with) our products and services. Specifically, we compete with the major niche social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter. We also compete with several smaller niche social websites brands such as sosyalan.com, risingstars.ph and greatpinoy.com. We believe that we are currently one of the smallest in the industry, as we currently have only a nominal web presence and no revenues from our main business operations.

&#160;

Management believes we can offset any such competitive disadvantages by being a price leader in the marketplace, first by offering free access to our website, and thereafter by offering more competitively priced premium package services. Initially, general subscriptions to our site are free and premium package subscriptions are approximately $12.50 to $125.00 per year. We will also seek to differentiate ourselves by providing our subscribers with more attractive social network features, such as tools for subscribers to easily communicate with each other.

&#160; 

MARKETING &#38; SALES STRATEGY 

&#160;

The use of Internet is continuing to evolve as a global platform for doing business. Our major focus in the first year will be to use Google Adwords program in order to drive traffic to our own website. We plan to take advantage of the well established Google Adwords marketing program which places online ads on the search result pages of Internet users. Google uses an advertising methodology referred to as cost-per-click (&#8220;CPC&#8221;) in its Adwords program. Using this strategy will allow us to design our own ads, and to select target locations such as a city or state and use keywords in our ads. A keyword is a word that is used by an Internet user who is performing an online search to find out information on a specific topic.

&#160;

Our primary target market is focused on Internet users who already participate in social networking websites. With CPC advertising, we only pay for the number of actual clicks on our advertisement. Each time someone clicks on our Google ad they will be redirected to our web site. A CPC-based advertising strategy is cost effective because an advertiser only pays for the leads they receive. The CPC marketing campaign is an integral part of our long term strategy. Our marketing campaign will monitor daily statistics and track favorite topics in order to quickly get in synch with our Internet audience. This is a significant part of our branding strategy.

&#160; 

ONLINE ADVERTISING 

&#160;

The majority of our advertising and promotional activities will be concentrated on an online advertising campaign using Google Adwords. We have selected Google because of its success and popularity for web users wishing to find something using an internet search. The Google Adwords program will allow us to customize the text of our advertisements, the frequency of each advertisement&#8217;s appearance, and the length of the advertising contract. For our purposes, we believe that this will give us the maximum amount of flexibility and allow us to closely monitor the costs of the marketing campaign.

&#160;

We currently do not have the ability to advertise on mobile devices because we do not have a software application (or &#8220;app&#8221;) for mobile devices. The fact that we do not have a software application able to support advertising on mobile devices will likely mean that we will have less advertising revenue that if we have had such a software application. We have planned for the development of such an application in the first three line items of our Use of Proceeds table on page 15. The first three line items are: OCW (Overseas Contract Workers) Social Networking Site, Global Karaoke Social Networking Sites and EBID services, and much of the software code which needs to be developed for those three line items is the same software code we need for a software application which supports advertising on mobile devices. We expect the total development cost to be approximately $300,000. There can be no assurance that we will raise the approximately $300,000 required to develop a software application which supports advertising on mobile devices.

&#160; 

EMAIL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN 

&#160;

We anticipate that an information style email advertising campaign may help to enhance our online advertising campaign and bring us into direct contact with people who are interested in using our services. In this regard, we are considering acquiring email lists, which may be done on an incremental basis so as not to incur a large expense before determining whether an email campaign works and meets our expectations.

&#160;

We have budgeted a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $20,000 for advertising, marketing and sales during the 12 months following completion of this Offering. We intend to hire a marketing manager to be responsible for managing all of our marketing and sales activities.

&#160; 

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES 

&#160;

We will be developing our own website, and the distribution of our website services will be over the Internet. We intend to engage the services of independent contractors in relation to web design and programming as we may require. We believe there are no constraints on the sources or availability of products, supplies, or suppliers related to our business.

&#160; 

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

&#160;

Our website will be available to the general public over the Internet. Initially, general subscriptions will be free, and premium package subscriptions will be $12.50 to $125.00 per year. As our subscription fees will be priced for mass market consumption, we do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers for the foreseeable future.
