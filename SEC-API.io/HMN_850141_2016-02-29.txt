Overview and Available Information 

&#160;

Horace Mann Educators Corporation (&#8220;HMEC&#8221;; and together with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Horace Mann&#8221;) is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware. Through its subsidiaries, HMEC markets and underwrites personal lines of property and casualty (primarily personal lines automobile and homeowners) insurance, retirement annuities (primarily tax-qualified products) and life insurance in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;). HMEC's principal insurance subsidiaries are Horace Mann Life Insurance Company (&#8220;HMLIC&#8221;), Horace Mann Insurance Company (&#8220;HMIC&#8221;), Horace Mann Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company (&#8220;HMPCIC&#8221;) and Teachers Insurance Company (&#8220;TIC&#8221;), each of which is an Illinois corporation, and Horace Mann Lloyds (&#8220;HM Lloyds&#8221;), an insurance company domiciled in Texas.

&#160;

Founded by Educators for Educators &#174; , the Company markets its products primarily to K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families. The Company's nearly one million customers typically have moderate annual incomes, with many belonging to two-income households. Their financial planning tends to focus on retirement, security, savings and primary insurance needs. Management believes that Horace Mann is the largest national multiline insurance company focused on the nation's educators as its primary market.

&#160;

Horace Mann markets and services its products primarily through a dedicated sales force of full-time agents supported by the Company&#8217;s Customer Contact Center. These agents sell Horace Mann's products and limited additional third-party vendor products. Some of these agents are former educators or individuals with close ties to the educational community who utilize their contacts within, and knowledge of, the target market. This dedicated agent sales force is supplemented by an independent agent distribution channel for the Company&#8217;s annuity products.

&#160;

The Company's insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.3 billion and net income was $93.5 million. The Company's total assets were $10.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The Company's investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2015 and consisted principally of investment grade, publicly traded fixed maturity securities.

&#160;

The Company conducts and manages its business through four segments. The three operating segments, representing the major lines of insurance business, are: property and casualty insurance, annuity products, and life insurance. The Company does not allocate the impact of corporate-level transactions to the insurance segments, consistent with the basis for management&#8217;s evaluation of the results of those segments, but classifies those items in the fourth segment, corporate and other. The property and casualty, annuity, and life segments accounted for 48%, 44% and 8%, respectively, of the Company's insurance premiums written and contract deposits for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

The Company is one of the largest participants in the K-12 portion of the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Company's 403(b) tax-qualified annuities are voluntarily purchased by individuals employed by public school systems or other tax-exempt organizations through the employee benefit plans of those entities. The Company has 403(b) payroll deduction capabilities utilized by approximately one-third of the 13,500 public school districts in the U.S.

&#160;

(1) For the purpose of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, &#8220;earnings&#8221; consist of income before income taxes and fixed charges, and &#8220;fixed charges&#8221; consist of interest expense (including amortization of debt issuance cost) and interest credited to policyholders on investment contracts and life insurance products with account values. (2) Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the weighted average number of fully vested restricted stock units and common stock units payable as shares of HMEC common stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares and common stock equivalents outstanding, to the extent dilutive. The Company's common stock equivalents relate to outstanding common stock options, common stock units (related to deferred compensation for Directors and employees) and restricted stock units. (3) Information regarding assets by segment at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is contained in &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Note 14 &#8212; Segment Information&#8221; listed on page F-1 of this report.

Corporate Strategy and Marketing

&#160;

The Horace Mann Value Proposition

&#160;

The Horace Mann Value Proposition articulates the Company's overarching strategy and business purpose: Provide lifelong financial well-being for educators and their families through personalized service, advice, and a full range of tailored insurance and financial products.

&#160;

Target Market 

&#160;

Management believes that Horace Mann is the largest national multiline insurance company focused on the nation's educators as its primary market. The Company's target market consists primarily of K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families located throughout the U.S. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that there are approximately 6.2 million teachers, school administrators and education support personnel in public schools in the U.S.; approximately 3.1 million of these individuals are elementary and secondary teachers.

&#160; 

Dedicated Agency Force 

&#160;

A cornerstone of Horace Mann&#8217;s marketing strategy is its dedicated sales force of agents, supported by the Company&#8217;s Customer Contact Center. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a combined total of 735 Exclusive Agencies and Employee Agents. Approximately 76% of the appointed agents are licensed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) to sell variable annuities and variable universal life policies. Some individuals in the agency force were previously teachers, other members of the education profession or persons with close ties to the educational community. The Company&#8217;s dedicated agents are under contract to market only the Company's products and limited additional third-party vendor products. Collectively, the Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are licensed to write business in 49 states and the District of Columbia.

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s dedicated agency force operates in its Agency Business Model (&#8220;ABM&#8221;), consisting of Exclusive Agencies as well as a limited number of Employee Agents in outside offices with licensed producers. The Company&#8217;s Exclusive Agent (&#8220;EA&#8221;) agreement is designed to place agents in the position to become business owners in their territories and invest their own capital to grow their agencies. Exclusive Agents are non-employee, independent contractors. On an ongoing basis, the Company provides follow-up training and support to agents regarding the Company&#8217;s products, as well as to further embed repeatable processes and fully maximize the potential of ABM.

&#160; 

Broadening Distribution Options 

&#160;

To complement and extend the reach of the Company&#8217;s agency force and to more fully utilize its approved payroll slots in school systems across the country, the Company utilizes a network of independent agents to distribute the Company's 403(b) tax-qualified annuity products. In addition to serving educators in areas where the Company does not have dedicated agents, the independent agents complement the annuity capabilities of the Company's agency force in under-penetrated areas. At December 31, 2015, there were approximately 500 independent agents approved to market the Company&#8217;s annuity products throughout the U.S. During 2015, collected contract deposits from this distribution channel were approximately $53 million. Combined with business from the Company&#8217;s dedicated agency force, total annuity collected contract deposits were $548 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Geographic Composition of Business 

&#160;

The Company's business is geographically diversified. For the year ended December 31, 2015, based on direct premiums and contract deposits for all product lines, the top five states and their portion of total direct insurance premiums and contract deposits were California, 8.1%; Illinois, 6.8%; Texas, 6.6%; North Carolina, 6.2%; and Florida, 5.9%.

&#160;

HMEC's property and casualty subsidiaries are licensed to write business in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The following table shows the Company's top ten property and casualty states based on total direct premiums.

(1) These measures are used by the Company's management to evaluate performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. These measures are components of net income but are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and there is inclusion or exclusion of certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in a GAAP financial measure. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of these measures is meaningful to provide investors with an understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's periodic results of operations. &#183; Catastrophe costs - The sum of catastrophe losses and property and casualty catastrophe reinsurance reinstatement premiums. &#183; Catastrophe losses - In categorizing property and casualty claims as being from a catastrophe, the Company utilizes the designations of the Property Claim Services, a subsidiary of Insurance Services Office, Inc. (&#8220;ISO&#8221;), and additionally beginning in 2007, includes losses from all such events that meet the definition of covered loss in the Company&#8217;s primary catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contract, and reports loss and loss adjustment expense amounts net of reinsurance recoverables. A catastrophe is a severe loss resulting from natural and man-made events within a particular territory, including risks such as hurricane, fire, earthquake, windstorm, explosion, terrorism and other similar events, that causes $25 million or more in insured property and casualty losses for the industry and affects a significant number of property and casualty insurers and policyholders. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics. Catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount of loss in advance. Their effects are not included in earnings or claim and claim adjustment expense reserves prior to occurrence. In the opinion of the Company's management, a discussion of the impact of catastrophes is meaningful for investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings. &#160;

Property and Casualty Reserves

&#160;

Property and casualty unpaid claims and claim expenses (&#8220;loss reserves&#8221;) represent management&#8217;s estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and settlement expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The Company calculates and records a single best estimate of the reserve as of each balance sheet date in conformity with generally accepted actuarial standards. For additional information regarding the process used to estimate property and casualty reserves and the risk factors involved, as well as a summary reconciliation of the beginning and ending property and casualty insurance claims and claim expense reserves and reserve development recorded in each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, see &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Note 5 &#8212; Property and Casualty Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses&#8221;, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies &#8212; Liabilities for Property and Casualty Claims and Claim Expenses&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2015 &#8212; Benefits, Claims and Settlement Expenses&#8221;.

&#160;

All of the Company's reserves for property and casualty unpaid claims and claim expenses are carried at the full value of estimated liabilities and are not discounted for interest expected to be earned on reserves. Due to the nature of the Company's personal lines business, the Company has no exposure to losses related to claims for toxic waste cleanup, other environmental remediation or asbestos-related illnesses other than claims under homeowners insurance policies for environmentally related items such as mold.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The claim reserve development table below illustrates the change over time in the net reserves established for property and casualty insurance claims and claim expenses at the end of various calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts of claims for which settlements have been made in cash as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of the Company learning additional facts that pertain to the unsettled claims. The fourth section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverables. The claim reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In evaluating the information in the table below, it should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, if a claim was first reserved in 2005 at $100 thousand and then determined in 2014 to be $150 thousand, the $50 thousand deficiency (actual claim minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative deficiency in each of the years 2005 - 2013 shown below. This table presents development data by calendar year and does not relate the data to the year in which the accident actually occurred. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of these reserves in the past will not necessarily recur in the future. It may not be appropriate to use this cumulative history in the projection of future performance.

(1) Reserves net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables (&#8220;Net Reserves&#8221;). Net Reserves is a measure used by the Company&#8217;s management to evaluate the overall adequacy of the property and casualty loss reserves and management believes it provides an alternative view of the Company&#8217;s anticipated liabilities after reflecting expected recoveries from its reinsurers. This is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under applicable SEC rules because it is not displayed as a separate item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For balance sheet reporting, GAAP does not permit the Company to offset expected reinsurance recoveries against liabilities, yet management believes it is useful to investors to take these expected recoveries into account. These adjustments only affect the classification of these items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and there is no impact on the Company&#8217;s benefits, claims and settlement expenses incurred as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) For discussion of the reserve development, see &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Note 5 &#8212; Property and Casualty Unpaid Claims and Claim Expenses&#8221; listed on page F-1 of this report. &#160;

Property and Casualty Reinsurance 

&#160;

All reinsurance is obtained through contracts which generally are entered into for each calendar year. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge the Company from primary liability for the full amount of its policies, it does allow for recovery from assuming reinsurers to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. Past due reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2015 were not material.

&#160;

The Company maintains catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coverage. For 2015, the Company&#8217;s catastrophe excess of loss coverage consisted of one contract in addition to a minimal amount of coverage by the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (&#8220;FHCF&#8221;). The catastrophe excess of loss contract provided 95% coverage for catastrophe losses above a retention of $25.0 million per occurrence up to $175.0 million per occurrence. This contract consisted of three layers, each of which provided for one mandatory reinstatement. The layers were $25.0 million excess of $25.0 million, $40.0 million excess of $50.0 million and $85.0 million excess of $90.0 million. For 2016, the Company&#8217;s catastrophe excess of loss coverage consists of one contract, and the contract has the same provisions as described for 2015.

&#160;

The Company has not joined the California Earthquake Authority (&#8220;CEA&#8221;). The Company's exposure to losses from earthquakes is managed through its underwriting standards, its earthquake policy coverage limits and deductible levels, and the geographic distribution of its business, as well as its reinsurance program. After reviewing the exposure to earthquake losses from the Company&#8217;s own policies and from what it would be with participation in the CEA, including estimated start-up and ongoing costs related to CEA participation, management believes it is in the Company's best economic interest to offer earthquake coverage directly to its homeowners policyholders.

&#160;

For liability coverages, in 2015 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $0.9 million up to $2.5 million on a per occurrence basis and $20.0 million in a clash event. (A clash cover is a reinsurance casualty excess contract requiring two or more casualty coverages or policies issued by the Company to be involved in the same loss occurrence for coverage to apply.) Effective January 1, 2016, for liability coverages the retention remains $0.9 million with coverage up to $5.0 million on a per occurrence basis and $20.0 million in a clash event.

&#160;

For property coverages, in 2015 the Company reinsured each loss above a retention of $0.9 million up to $2.5 million on a per risk basis, including catastrophe losses. Also, the Company could submit to the reinsurers three per risk losses from the same occurrence for a total of $4.8 million of property recovery in any one event. Retention for property coverages remains $0.9 million, with coverage up to $5.0 million on a per risk basis, including catastrophe losses and the Company can submit to the reinsurers two per risk losses from the same occurrence for a total of $8.2 million of property recovery in any one event.

Annuity Segment

&#160;

Educators in the Company's target market continue to benefit from the provisions of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) which began in 1961. This section of the Code allows public school employees and employees of other tax-exempt organizations, such as not-for-profit private schools, to utilize pretax income to make periodic contributions to a qualified retirement plan. (Also see &#8220;Regulation &#8212; Regulation at Federal Level&#8221;.) The Company entered the educators retirement annuity market in 1961 and is one of the largest participants in the K-12 portion of the 403(b) tax-qualified annuity market, measured by 403(b) net written premium on a statutory accounting basis. The Company has 403(b) payroll deduction capabilities utilized by approximately one-third of the 13,500 public school districts in the U.S. Approximately 44% of the Company's new annuity contract deposits in 2015 were for 403(b) tax-qualified annuities; approximately 61% of accumulated annuity value on deposit is 403(b) tax-qualified. In 2015, annuities represented 44% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated insurance premiums written and contract deposits.

&#160;

The Company markets both fixed and variable annuity contracts, primarily on a tax-qualified basis. Fixed only annuities provide a guarantee of principal and a guaranteed minimum rate of return. These contracts are backed by the Company&#8217;s general account investments. The Company bears the investment risk associated with the investments and may change the declared interest rate on these contracts subject to contract guarantees. In 2014, the Company began offering fixed indexed annuity (&#8220;FIA&#8221;) products with interest crediting strategies linked to the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These products are fixed annuities with a guaranteed minimum interest rate, as described above, plus a contingent return based on equity market performance. The Company purchases call options on the applicable indices as an investment to provide the income needed to fund the annual index credits on the indexed products.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Variable annuities combine a fixed account option with equity- and bond-linked sub-account options. In general, the contractholders bear the investment risk related to the variable annuity sub-accounts and may change their allocation between the guaranteed interest rate fixed account and the wide range of variable investment options at any time. By utilizing tools that provide assistance in determining needs and making asset allocation decisions, contractholders are able to choose the investment mix that matches their personal risk tolerance and retirement goals. The Company&#8217;s sub-account options also include both lifecycle funds and asset allocation funds. These all-purpose funds have assets allocated among multiple investment classes within each fund based on a specific targeted retirement date or risk tolerance.

&#160;

Variable annuity contracts with a guaranteed minimum death benefit (&#8220;GMDB&#8221;) provide an additional benefit if the contractholder dies and the contract value is less than a contractually defined amount. The Company has a relatively low exposure to GMDB risk because approximately 32% of contract values have no guarantee; approximately 62% have only a return of premium guarantee; and only approximately 6% have a guarantee of premium roll-up at an annual rate of 3% or 5%.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 105 variable sub-account options including funds managed by some of the best-known names in the mutual fund industry, such as AllianceBernstein, American Century, American Funds, Ariel, BlackRock, Calvert, Davis, Delaware, Dreyfus, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Ibbotson, JPMorgan, Lazard, Lord Abbett, MFS, Neuberger Berman, Putnam, Rainier, Royce, T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, Wells Fargo and Wilshire, offering the Company's customers multiple investment options to address their personal investment objectives and risk tolerance. These funds have been selected with the assistance of Wilshire Associates, the Company&#8217;s funds advisor, which provides oversight and input to fund manager additions and replacements. Total accumulated fixed and variable annuity cash value on deposit at December 31, 2015 was $6.0 billion.

&#160;

Among the Company&#8217;s annuity products, the Goal Planning Annuity offers educators a variable annuity with the Company&#8217;s wide array of sub-account investment choices. It includes an optional first year premium bonus and two optional riders that enhance the death benefit feature of the product. Another product, Expanding Horizon, is a fixed interest rate annuity contract for investors who do not want investment risk exposure. This product offers educators a competitive rate of interest on their retirement dollars and a choice of bonuses to optimize their benefits at retirement. The Destination Fixed Indexed Annuity product is designed to have potentially greater credited interest rates over the long term than traditional fixed rate annuities, because the credited interest rate will be linked to changes in an index, either the S&#38;P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

&#160;

In addition to individual annuities, the Company offers group variable and fixed annuity products that allow flexibility in customizing 403(b) annuity programs to meet the needs of school districts.

&#160;

To assist agents in delivering the Horace Mann Value Proposition, the Company has entered into third-party vendor agreements with American Funds Distributors, Inc. and Fidelity Distributors Corporation to market their retail mutual funds and with Raymond James Financial, Inc. to market their mutual fund brokerage accounts. In addition to retail mutual funds accounts, the Company&#8217;s agents can offer a 529 college savings program and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts utilizing certain funds. The Company also markets 403(b)(7) tax-deferred mutual fund investment programs and a minimal amount of fixed indexed annuities through additional third-party vendor agreements. Third-party vendors underwrite these accounts or contracts and the Company receives commissions on the sales of these products.

Life Segment 

&#160;

The Company entered the individual life insurance business in 1949. The Company offers traditional term and whole life insurance products and, from time to time, revises products and product features or develops new products. For instance, the Company offers a discount for educator customers. Following is a description of some of the products and other features in the Company&#8217;s life product portfolio. Life by Design is a portfolio of Horace Mann manufactured and branded life insurance products which specifically addresses the financial planning needs of educators. The Life by Design portfolio features individual whole life and individual term products, including 10-, 20- and 30-year level term policies. The Life by Design policies have premiums that are guaranteed for the duration of the contract and offer lower minimum face amounts. The Company offers a combination product called Life Select that mixes a base of either traditional whole life, 20-pay life or life paid-up at age 65 with a variety of term riders to allow for more flexibility in tailoring the coverage to the customers&#8217; varying life insurance needs. Additional products and features are single premium whole life products, as well as a preferred plus underwriting category and $500 thousand and $1 million rate band enhancements for term products. The Company offers Cash Value Term &#8212; a term policy that builds cash value while providing the income protection of traditional level term life insurance. In October 2015, the Company introduced an indexed universal life (&#8220;IUL&#8221;) product with interest crediting strategies linked to the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average offering a contingent return based on equity market performance. Along with expanded product offerings, new marketing support tools continue to be introduced to aid the agency force. After December 31, 2006, the Company no longer issues new policies for its &#8220;Experience Life&#8221; product, a flexible, adjustable-premium life insurance contract that includes availability of an interest-bearing account.

&#160;

The Company's traditional term, whole life and group life business in force consists of approximately 147,000 policies, representing approximately $12.9 billion of life insurance in force, with annual insurance premiums and contract deposits of approximately $59.0 million as of December 31, 2015. In addition, the Company also had in force approximately 55,000 Experience Life policies, representing approximately $3.6 billion of life insurance in force, with annual insurance premiums and contract deposits of approximately $44.1 million.

&#160;

In 2015, the life segment represented 8% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated insurance premiums written and contract deposits.

&#160;

During 2015, the average face amount of ordinary life insurance policies issued by the Company was approximately $173,000 and the average face amount of all ordinary life insurance policies in force at December 31, 2015 was approximately $96,000.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The maximum individual life insurance risk retained by the Company is $300,000 on any individual life, while either $100,000 or $125,000 is retained on each group life policy depending on the type of coverage. The excess of the amounts retained are reinsured with life reinsurers that are rated &#8220;A- (Excellent)&#8221; or above by A.M. Best. The Company also maintains a life catastrophe reinsurance program. In 2015, the Company reinsured 100% of the catastrophe risk in excess of $1 million up to $35 million per occurrence, with one reinstatement. For 2016, the Company&#8217;s catastrophe risk coverage is unchanged. The Company&#8217;s life catastrophe risk reinsurance program covers acts of terrorism and includes nuclear, biological and chemical explosions but excludes other acts of war.

&#160;

The Company has programs to offer variable universal life and fixed interest rate universal life insurance with two third-party vendors underwriting such insurance. Through December 31, 2015, the Company also offered indexed universal life underwritten by a third-party vendor. Under these programs, the third-party vendors underwrite and bear the risk of these insurance policies and the Company receives a commission on the sale of that business.

Competition 

&#160;

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The insurance industry consists of a large number of insurance companies, some of which have substantially greater financial resources, widespread advertising campaigns, more diversified product lines, greater economies of scale and/or lower-cost marketing approaches compared to the Company. In the Company&#8217;s target market, management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of property and casualty insurance products are price, overall service, name recognition and worksite sales and service. Management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of the Company&#8217;s annuity products and life insurance are worksite sales and service, product features, perceived stability of the insurer, price, overall service and name recognition.

&#160;

The Company competes in its target market with a number of national providers of personal automobile, homeowners and life insurance such as State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, Liberty Mutual and Nationwide as well as several regional companies. The Company also competes for automobile business with other companies such as GEICO, Progressive and USAA, many of which feature direct marketing distribution.

&#160;

Among the major national providers of annuities to educators, the Company&#8217;s competitors for annuity business include The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (&#8220;VALIC&#8221;), a subsidiary of American International Group (&#8220;AIG&#8221;); AXA; Voya Financial, Inc.; Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, a subsidiary of National Life Insurance Company; MetLife; Security Benefit; and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association &#8211; College Retirement Equities Fund (&#8220;TIAA-CREF&#8221;). Select mutual fund families and financial planners also compete in this marketplace.

&#160;

The market for tax-deferred annuity products in the Company&#8217;s target market has been impacted by the revised Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) Section 403(b) regulations, which made the 403(b) market more comparable to the 401(k) market than it was in the past. While this change has and may continue to reduce the number of competitors in this market, it has made the 403(b) market more attractive to some of the larger companies experienced in 401(k) plans, including both insurance and mutual fund companies, that had not previously been active competitors in this business.

Investments

&#160;

The Company's investments are selected to balance the objectives of protecting principal, minimizing exposure to interest rate risk and providing a high current yield. These objectives are implemented through a portfolio that emphasizes investment grade, publicly traded fixed income securities, which are selected to match the anticipated duration of the Company&#8217;s liabilities. When impairment of the value of an investment is considered other-than-temporary, the decrease in value is recorded and a new cost basis is established. At December 31, 2015, fixed income securities represented 93.0% of the Company&#8217;s total investment portfolio, at fair value. Of the fixed income investment portfolio, 96.5% was investment grade and 95.3% was publicly traded. At December 31, 2015, the average quality and average option-adjusted duration of the total fixed income portfolio were A and 5.8 years, respectively. At December 31, 2015, investments in non-investment grade fixed income securities represented 3.4% of the total investment portfolio, at fair value. There are no significant investments in mortgage whole loans, real estate or non-U.S. dollar-denominated foreign securities.

&#160;

The Company has separate investment strategies and guidelines for its property and casualty, annuity and life assets, which recognize different characteristics of the associated insurance liabilities, as well as different tax and regulatory environments. The Company manages interest rate exposure for its portfolios through asset/liability management techniques which attempt to coordinate the duration of the assets with the duration of the insurance policy liabilities. Duration of assets and liabilities will generally differ only because of opportunities to significantly increase yields or because policy values are not interest-sensitive, as is the case in the property and casualty segment.

&#160;

The investments of each insurance subsidiary must comply with the insurance laws of such insurance subsidiary's domiciliary state. These laws prescribe the type and amount of investments that may be purchased and held by insurance companies. In general, these laws permit investments, within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications, in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed bonds, other asset-backed bonds, preferred stocks, common stocks, real estate mortgages, real estate, and alternative investments.

* Less than $0.1 million. (1) Includes $455.3 million fair value of investments guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and $595.3 million fair value of federally sponsored agency securities which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. (2) A non-investment grade rating is assigned to a security when it is acquired or when it is downgraded from investment grade, primarily on the basis of the Standard &#38; Poor's Corporation (&#8220;Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s&#8221; or &#8220;S&#38;P&#8221;) rating for such security, or if there is no S&#38;P rating, the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (&#8220;Moody's&#8221;) rating for such security, or if there is no S&#38;P or Moody's rating, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&#8217; (the &#8220;NAIC&#8221;) rating for such security. The rating agencies monitor securities, and their issuers, regularly and make changes to the ratings as necessary. The Company incorporates rating changes on a monthly basis. (3) Includes commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, other mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. See also &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2015 &#8212; Net Realized Investment Gains and Losses&#8221; listed on page F-1 of this report. (4) Short-term investments mature within one year of being acquired and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Short-term investments included $169.7 million in money market funds rated AAA, one $4.0 million corporate bond rated BBB and one $0.4 million corporate bond rated BB. (5) Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost or unpaid principal balance. (6) Approximately 7% of the Company's investment portfolio, having a carrying value of $515.1 million as of December 31, 2015, consisted of securities with some form of credit support, such as insurance. Of the securities with credit support as of December 31, 2015, municipal bonds represented $337.7 million carrying value. &#160;

Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, approximately 27% of the Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio was expected to mature within the next 5 years. Mortgage-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities of U.S. Governmental agencies, represented approximately 26% of the total investment portfolio at December 31, 2015. These securities typically have average lives shorter than their stated maturities due to unscheduled prepayments on the underlying mortgages. Mortgages are prepaid for a variety of reasons, including sales of existing homes, interest rate changes over time that encourage homeowners to refinance their mortgages and defaults by homeowners on mortgages that are then paid by guarantors.

&#160;

For financial reporting purposes, the Company has classified the entire fixed maturity portfolio as &#8220;available for sale&#8221;. Fixed maturities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value. The net adjustment for unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale is recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity, net of applicable deferred tax asset or liability and the related impact on deferred policy acquisition costs associated with investment contracts and life insurance products with account values. Fixed maturities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other related factors, other than securities that are in an unrealized loss position for which management has the stated intent to hold until recovery.

Cash Flow 

&#160;

Information regarding HMEC&#8217;s sources and uses of cash, including payment of principal and interest with respect to HMEC's indebtedness, and payment by HMEC of dividends to its shareholders, is contained in &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Note 10 &#8212; Statutory Information and Restrictions&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Financial Resources &#8212; Cash Flow&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Capital Resources&#8221; listed on page F-1 of this report.

&#160;

The ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to HMEC is subject to state insurance department regulations which generally permit dividends to be paid for any 12 month period in amounts equal to the greater of (i) net income for the preceding calendar year or (ii) 10% of surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting principles, as of the preceding December 31st. Any dividend in excess of these levels requires the prior approval of the Director or Commissioner of the state insurance department of the state in which the dividend paying insurance subsidiary is domiciled. The aggregate amount of dividends that may be paid in 2016 from all of HMEC's insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval is approximately $90 million.

&#160;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if insurance regulators otherwise determine that payment of a dividend or any other payment to an affiliate would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary's policyholders or creditors, because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise, the regulators may block dividends or other payments to affiliates that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval.

Regulation 

&#160;

General Regulation at State Level 

&#160;

As an insurance holding company, HMEC is subject to extensive regulation by the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business. Some regulations, such as those addressing unclaimed property, generally apply to all corporations. In addition, the laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers, which relate to a wide variety of matters, including granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices and rate setting, licensing agents, requiring statutory financial statements, monitoring insurer solvency and reserve adequacy, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. On an ongoing basis, various state legislators and insurance regulators examine the nature and scope of state insurance regulation.

&#160;

In addition to individual state monitoring and regulation, state regulators develop coordinated regulatory policies through the NAIC. States have adopted NAIC risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to an insurance company's risks. Based on current guidelines, the risk-based capital statutory requirements are not expected to have a negative regulatory impact on HMEC&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, statutory capital and surplus of each of the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries was above required levels. States have also adopted the NAIC&#8217;s U.S. Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;) which requires insurance companies to submit their own assessment of their current and future risks and provide a consolidated group-level perspective on risk and capital formulated through an internal risk self-assessment process.

Assessments Against Insurers and Mandatory Insurance Facilities 

&#160;

Under insurance insolvency or guaranty laws in most states in which the Company operates, insurers doing business therein can be assessed for policyholder losses related to insolvencies of other insurance companies, and many assessments paid by the Company pursuant to these laws may be used as credits for a portion of the Company's premium taxes in certain states. Also, the Company is required to participate in various mandatory insurance facilities in proportion to the amount of the Company's direct writings in the applicable state. For the three years ended December 31, 2015, the impact of the above industry items were not material to the Company&#8217;s results of operations.

&#160;

Regulation at Federal Level 

&#160;

Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal initiatives often impact the insurance business. Current and proposed federal measures which may significantly affect insurance and annuity business include employee benefits regulation, standards applied to employer sponsored retirement plans, standards applied to certain financial advisors, controls on the costs of medical care, medical entitlement programs such as Medicare, structure of retirement plans and accounts, changes to the insurance industry anti-trust exemption, and minimum solvency requirements. See also &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;. Other federal regulation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and USA PATRIOT Act, including its anti-money laundering regulations, also impact the Company&#8217;s business.

The variable annuities underwritten by HMLIC are regulated by the SEC. Horace Mann Investors, Inc., the broker-dealer and Registered Investment Adviser subsidiary of HMEC, also is regulated by the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rule-making Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;) and various state securities regulators.

&#160;

Federal income taxation of the build-up of cash value within a life insurance policy or an annuity contract could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's ability to market and sell such products. Various legislation to this effect has been proposed in the past, but has not been enacted. Although no such legislative proposals are known to exist at this time, such proposals may be made again in the future. Changes in other federal and state laws and regulations could also affect the relative tax and other advantages of the Company's annuity and life products to customers.

&#160;

Financial Regulation Legislation 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;) created the Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO studies the current insurance regulatory system and is charged with monitoring and providing specific reports on various aspects of the insurance industry. However, the FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The FIO has suggested an expanded federal role in some circumstances. As various aspects of Dodd-Frank continue to be addressed by governmental bodies, management will continue to monitor these future developments for impact on the Company, insurers of similar size and the insurance industry as a whole.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 1,350 non-agent employees and 46 full-time Employee Agents. (This does not include 638 Exclusive Agent independent contractors that were part of the Company&#8217;s total dedicated agency force at December 31, 2015.) The Company has no collective bargaining agreement with any employees.
