 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

We were incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2001. We are a medical technology company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Traditionally, these patients have relied on stationary oxygen concentrator systems for use in the home and oxygen tanks or cylinders for mobile use, which we call the delivery model. The tanks and cylinders must be delivered regularly and have a finite amount of oxygen, which requires patients to plan activities outside of their homes around delivery schedules and a finite oxygen supply. Additionally, patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to their stationary concentrators simply to enable mobility within their homes. Our proprietary Inogen One &#174; systems concentrate the air around the patient to offer a single source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere with a portable device weighing approximately 4.8 or 7.0 pounds. Our Inogen One G2 &#174; and Inogen One G3 &#174; have up to 5 and 4.5 hours of battery life, respectively, with a single battery and can be plugged into an outlet when at home, in a car, or in a public place with outlets available. Our Inogen One systems reduce the patient&#8217;s reliance on stationary concentrators and scheduled deliveries of tanks with a finite supply of oxygen, thereby improving patient quality of life and fostering mobility. 

Portable oxygen concentrators represent the fastest-growing segment of the Medicare oxygen therapy market between 2012 and 2014 and the Company estimates based on 2014 Medicare data (which excludes private insurance and cash sales), that patients using portable oxygen concentrators represent approximately 6% to 8% of the total addressable oxygen market in the United States. Based on 2014 industry data, we believe we were the leading worldwide manufacturer of portable oxygen concentrators, as well as the largest provider of portable oxygen concentrators to Medicare patients, as measured by dollar volume. We believe we are the only manufacturer of portable oxygen concentrators that employs a direct-to-consumer strategy in the United States, meaning we market our products to patients, process their physician paperwork, provide clinical support as needed and bill Medicare or insurance on their behalf. To pursue a direct-to-consumer strategy, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements and secure Medicare billing privileges, as well as compete with the home medical equipment providers that many rely on across their entire homecare business. 

Since adopting our direct-to-consumer strategy in 2009 following our acquisition of Comfort Life Medical Supply, LLC, which had an active Medicare billing number but few other assets and limited business activities, we have directly sold or rented our Inogen oxygen concentrators to more than 127,000 patients as of December 31, 2015. 

We generated revenue of $159.0 million, $112.5 million and $75.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, while generating net income of $11.6 million, $6.8 million and $25.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Our market 

We believe the current total addressable oxygen therapy market in the United States is approximately $3 billion to $4 billion, based on 2014 Medicare data and our estimate of the ratio of the Medicare market to the total market. We estimate that there are 2.5 to 3 million patients in the United States and more than 4.5 million patients worldwide who use oxygen therapy, and more than 60% of oxygen therapy patients in the United States are covered by Medicare. The number of oxygen therapy patients in the United States is projected to grow by approximately 7% to 10% per year between 2015 and 2021, which we believe is the result of earlier diagnosis of chronic respiratory conditions, demographic trends and longer durations of long-term oxygen therapy. 

&#160;

&#160;

Long-term oxygen therapy has been shown to be a cost-efficient and clinically effective means to treat hypoxemia, a condition in which patients have insufficient oxygen in the blood. Hypoxemic patients are unable to convert oxygen found in the air into the bloodstream in an efficient manner, causing organ damage and poor health. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a leading cause of hypoxemia. Approximately 70% of our patient population has been diagnosed with COPD, which we believe is reflective of the long-term oxygen therapy market in general. Industry sources estimate that 24 million people in the United States suffer from COPD, of which one-half are undiagnosed. 

According to our analysis of 2014 Medicare data, approximately two-thirds of U.S. oxygen users require ambulatory oxygen and the remaining one-third require only stationary or nocturnal oxygen. Clinical data has shown that ambulatory patients that use oxygen twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, or 24/7, regardless of whether such patients rely on portable oxygen concentrators or the delivery model, have approximately two times the survival rate and spend at least 60% fewer days annually in the hospital than non-ambulatory 24/7 patients. The cost of one year of oxygen therapy is less than the cost of one day in the hospital. Of the ambulatory patients, we estimate that approximately 85% rely upon the delivery model, which has the following disadvantages: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

limited flexibility outside the home, dictated by the finite oxygen supply provided by tanks and cylinders and dependence on delivery schedules; 

&#160;

&#183; 

restricted mobility and inconvenience within the home, as patients must attach long, cumbersome tubing to a noisy stationary concentrator to move within their homes; 

&#160;

&#183; 

products are not cleared for use on commercial aircraft and cannot plug into a vehicle outlet for extended use; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

high costs driven by the infrastructure necessary to establish a geographically diverse distribution network to serve patients locally, as well as personnel, fuel and other costs, which have limited economies of scale and generally increase over time. 

Portable oxygen concentrators were developed in response to many of the limitations associated with traditional oxygen therapy. Portable oxygen concentrators are designed to offer a self-replenishing, unlimited supply of oxygen that is concentrated from the surrounding air and to operate without the need for oxygen tanks or regular oxygen deliveries, enhancing patient independence and mobility. Additionally, because portable oxygen concentrators do not require the physical infrastructure and service intensity of the delivery model, we believe portable oxygen concentrators can provide long-term oxygen therapy with a lower cost structure. Despite the ability of portable oxygen concentrators to address many of the shortcomings of traditional oxygen therapy, we estimate based on 2014 Medicare data (which excludes private insurance and cash sales) that the amount spent by patients with portable oxygen concentrators represents approximately 6% to 8% of the total addressable oxygen market in the United States. We believe the following has hindered the market acceptance of portable oxygen concentrators: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

to obtain portable oxygen concentrators, patients are dependent on home medical equipment providers, which have made significant investments in the physical distribution infrastructure to support the delivery model and which we believe are therefore disincentivized to encourage adoption of portable oxygen concentrators; 

&#160;

&#183; 

constrained manufacturing costs of conventional portable oxygen concentrators, driven by home medical equipment provider preference for products that have lower upfront equipment cost; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

limitations of conventional portable oxygen concentrators, including bulkiness, poor reliability and lack of suitability beyond intermittent or travel use. 

Our solution 

Our Inogen One systems provide patients who require long-term oxygen therapy with a reliable, lightweight single solution product that we believe improves quality-of-life, fosters mobility and eliminates dependence on both oxygen tanks and cylinders as well as stationary concentrators. We believe our direct-to-consumer strategy increases our ability to effectively develop, design and market our Inogen One solutions, as it allows us to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

drive patient awareness of our portable oxygen concentrators through direct marketing, sidestepping the home medical equipment channel that other manufacturers rely upon across their homecare businesses, and that is incentivized to continue to service oxygen patients through the delivery model; 

&#160;

&#183; 

capture the manufacturer and home medical equipment provider margins, allowing us to focus on the total cost of the solution and to invest in the development of product features instead of being constrained by the price required to attract representation from a distribution channel. For example, we have invested in features that improve patient satisfaction, product durability, reliability and longevity, which increase the cost of our hardware, but reduce the total cost of our solution by reducing our maintenance and repair cost; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

access and utilize direct patient feedback in our research and development efforts, allowing us to innovate based on this feedback and stay at the forefront of patient preference. For example, we have integrated a double battery into our product offering based on direct patient feedback. &#160;

We believe the combination of our direct-to-consumer strategy with our singular focus on designing and developing oxygen concentrator technology has created the best-in-class portfolio of portable oxygen concentrators. Our two current portable product offerings, the Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2, at approximately 4.8 and 7.0 pounds, respectively, are among the lightest portable oxygen concentrators on the market. We believe our Inogen One solutions offer the following benefits: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Single solution for home, ambulatory, travel (including on commercial aircraft) and nocturnal treatment . We believe our Inogen One solutions are the only portable oxygen concentrators marketed as a single solution, by which we mean a patient can use our Inogen One systems as their only supplemental oxygen source with no need to also use a stationary concentrator regularly. Our compressors are specifically designed to enable our patients to run our portable oxygen concentrators 24/7, whether powered by battery or plugged into an outlet at home or in a car while the battery is recharging. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reliability . We have made product performance a priority and have improved reliability with each generation. For example, we have introduced a patented air-dryer and patent-pending user-replaceable sieve beds to our products, which have improved product performance and, as a result, patient satisfaction. Reliability is not only critical to patient satisfaction, but also cost management, as our minimal physical infrastructure makes product exchanges more costly to us than providers with greater local physical infrastructure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective for nocturnal use . Our Intelligent Delivery Technology enables our portable oxygen concentrators to provide consistent levels of oxygen during sleep despite decreased respiratory rates. As a result, patients can rely on the Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2 portable oxygen concentrators overnight while sleeping. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Unparalleled flow capacity . Our 4.8 pound Inogen One G3 has higher flow capacity than other sub-5 pound portable oxygen concentrators, and our 7.0 pound Inogen One G2 has higher flow capacity than other sub-10 pound portable oxygen concentrators. 

&#160;

&#183; 

User friendly features . Our systems are designed with multiple user friendly features, including long battery life and low noise levels in their respective weight categories. 

Our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home &#174; system 

We market our current portable product offerings, the Inogen One G3 and the Inogen One G2, as single solutions for oxygen therapy. This means our solutions can operate on a 24/7 basis for at least 60 months without a stationary concentrator. We believe the technology in our Inogen One G3 and our Inogen One G2 is effective for nocturnal use. Our Inogen One G2 and the Inogen One G3 are sub-5 and sub-10 pound portable oxygen concentrators that can operate reliably and cost-effectively over the long period of time needed to service oxygen therapy patients without supplemental use of a stationary concentrator or a replacement portable oxygen concentrator. The following table summarizes our key product features:

We have focused our research and development efforts on creating solutions that we believe have overcome the reputation of portable oxygen concentrators as being limited in durability and reliability as well as unsuitable for nighttime or 24/7 use. We specifically designed our compressors for 24/7 use. We have worked to improve our reliability and reduce service costs by equipping our portable oxygen concentrators with features such as membrane air dryers and user replaceable filtration cartridges. 

All of our Inogen One systems are equipped with Intelligent Delivery Technology, a form of pulse-dose technology from which the patient receives a bolus of oxygen upon inhalation. Pulse-dose technology was developed to extend the number of hours an oxygen 

&#160;

&#160;

tank would last and is generally used on all ambulatory oxygen therapy devices. Our proprietary conserver technology utilizes differentiated triggering sensitivity to quickly detect a breath and ensure oxygen delivery within the first 400 milliseconds of inspiration, the interval when oxygen has the most effect on lung gas exchange. During periods of sleep, respiratory rates typically decrease. Our Inogen One systems actively respond to this changing physiology through the use of proprietary technology that increases bolus size. Our Intelligent Delivery Technology is designed to provide effective levels of blood oxygen saturation during sleep and all other periods of rest and activity that are substantially equivalent to continuous flow systems. 

The Inogen One G3, our latest portable oxygen concentrator released to market in September 2012 and upgraded in December 2015, is among the lightest products on the market and has higher oxygen production capabilities than the other sub-5 pound portable oxygen concentrators on the market. We believe the performance parameters around the Inogen One G3 and Inogen One G2 allow us to serve approximately 95% of the ambulatory oxygen patients and enable us to address a patient&#8217;s particular clinical needs, as well as lifestyle and performance preferences. 

The Inogen At Home stationary oxygen concentrator allows us to access the non-ambulatory patient market and serves as a backup to our Inogen One system for ambulatory patients. We currently offer a backup source of oxygen to our patients who are able to elect either a stationary concentrator or oxygen tank as their backup source. 

At approximately 18 pounds, we believe the Inogen At Home concentrator is the lightest five liter per minute continuous flow oxygen concentrator on the market today. Additionally, the Inogen At Home product has low power consumption with worldwide electrical compatibility, which should reduce the cost of electricity for oxygen therapy patients, as well as reduce manufacturing and distribution complexities. While the Inogen One product line is clinically validated for 24/7 use, the Inogen At Home represents a compelling solution for nocturnal-only oxygen therapy patients that do not yet require a portable solution, which are estimated to represent greater than 30% of total oxygen patients in the United States.

Our direct-to-consumer business model has enabled us to receive direct patient feedback, and we have used this feedback to create portable oxygen concentrators that address the full suite of features and benefits critical to patient preference and retention. Our products prevent patients from having to choose between lightweight size, suitability for 24/7 use, reliability, and key features such as battery life, flow and reduced noise levels. 

Sales and marketing 

In the United States, we market and distribute our products directly to consumers, through a wide variety of direct-to-consumer marketing strategies including a physician referral model, as well as through distributors, resellers, private label partners, and home medical equipment providers. In addition, we sell through distributors, resellers, and home medical equipment providers in certain markets within Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.

Our direct-to-consumer sales and marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness and demand for our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems among patients, physicians and other clinicians, and third-party payors. As of December 31, 2015 we employed a marketing team of 7 people, an in-house sales team of 183 people, and a field-based sales force of 14 people, each based in the United States. Of the $123.7 million of our 2015 revenue derived from the United States, approximately 37% represented direct-to-consumer rentals, 35% represented cash-pay sales to consumers and 28% represented sales to third-party home medical equipment providers, distributors, and resellers. 

Patients who choose to use their Medicare or private insurance benefits rent our systems. Those who purchase our product outright are typically not eligible to use their insurance benefits due to their capped rental status, or choose to purchase because the patient prefers to own the equipment, or the patient has an upcoming trip where they have an immediate need for our product that cannot be processed in time by their primary insurance carrier. Our ability to rent to Medicare patients directly, bill Medicare and other third-party payors on their behalf, and service patients in their homes requires that we hold a valid Medicare supplier number, are accredited by an independent agency approved by Medicare, and comply with the differing licensure and process requirements in the 49 states in which we serve patients. 

&#160;

&#160;

We use a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing strategies to generate interest in our solutions among current oxygen therapy patients. After a patient contacts us, we guide them through product selection and insurance eligibility, and, if they choose to move forward, process the necessary reimbursement and physician paperwork on their behalf, as well as coordinate the shipping, instruction, and clinical setup process. In accordance with Medicare regulations, we do not initially contact patients directly and contact them only upon an inbound inquiry or upon receipt of a physician&#8217;s order. The chart below describes our United States direct-to-consumer sales and rental process. 

In addition to the direct-to-consumer marketing model, we are also utilizing a physician referral model as a complementary sales method. Under this model, our field sales representatives work with physicians in the representative&#8217;s territory to help physicians understand our products and the value these products provide for patients. We believe that by educating physicians on our products, we can cost-effectively supplement our direct-to-consumer sales and rentals and capture a greater number of patients earlier in the course of their oxygen therapy. 

Concentration of Customers

We sell our products to home medical equipment providers in the United States and in foreign countries on a credit basis. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

We also rent products directly to patients, which results in a customer concentration relating to Medicare&#8217;s service reimbursement programs. Medicare&#8217;s service reimbursement programs (net of patient co-insurance obligations) accounted for 74%, 76% and 73% of rental revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and based on total revenue were 21%, 27% and 29% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Accounts receivable balances relating to Medicare&#8217;s service reimbursement programs (including held and unbilled receivables, net of reserves) amounted to $7.4 million or 37% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and $6.1 million or 32% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014.

We engage in a number of other initiatives to increase awareness, demand, and orders for Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. These include attendance at oxygen therapy support groups, guest speaking arrangements at trade shows, and product demonstrations, as requested. Additionally, we are targeting private payors to become an in-network provider of oxygen therapy solutions, which we expect will reduce or eliminate any additional patient co-insurance associated with using our solution. We believe this will result in both increased conversion of our initial leads, as well as direct referrals from insurance companies in some cases. 

International 

Approximately 22% of our sales were from outside the United States in 2015. We sell our products in 44 countries outside the United States through distributors or directly to large &#8220;house&#8221; accounts, which include gas companies and home oxygen providers. In this case, we sell to and bill the distributor or &#8220;house&#8221; accounts directly, leaving the patient billing, support, and clinical setup to the 

&#160;

&#160;

local provider. As of December 31, 2015, we had 4 people who focused on selling our products to distributors and &#8220;house&#8221; accounts worldwide. No single international customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

International sales revenue grew to $35.3 million in 2015 from $24.4 million in 2014. We estimate there are 2 million long-term oxygen therapy patients outside of the United States. We believe that the international market is attractive for the following reasons: 

&#160;

&#183; 

more favorable reimbursement in certain countries, including France and the United Kingdom, where portable oxygen concentrators receive more favorable reimbursement than in the United States. 

&#160;

&#183; 

less developed oxygen delivery infrastructure in some countries. We believe that some countries outside the United States have less developed oxygen delivery infrastructure than in the United States. As a result, portable oxygen concentrators enable providers to reach and service patients they cannot economically reach with the delivery model. 

&#160;

&#183; 

an absence of reimbursement for any ambulatory oxygen therapy modalities in some countries, resulting in patients bearing all of the cost of ambulatory oxygen therapy and therefore becoming more involved in the selection of the modality. In Australia, for example, patients shoulder the burden of all costs associated with ambulatory oxygen therapy. In these cases, they tend to choose products like portable oxygen concentrators that provide a higher level of personal freedom. 

We will continue to focus on building out our international sales efforts. 

Customer support and order fulfillment 

Our procedures enable us to package and ship a system directly to the patient in the patient&#8217;s preferred configuration the same day the order is received in most cases. This enables us to minimize the amount of finished goods inventory we keep on hand. Our primary logistics partner is United Parcel Service, or UPS. UPS supports our domestic shipments and provides additional services that support our direct-to-consumer oxygen therapy program. The UPS pick up service is used to retrieve patient paperwork, products requiring repair and systems that are no longer needed by the patient. Additionally, UPS, when necessary and requested by us, will go into a patient&#8217;s home to remove a replacement product from the box, package the failed device and return it to us. In this manner, we are able to operate as a remote provider while maintaining the level of customer service of a local oxygen therapy provider. FedEx primarily supports our international shipments and limited domestic shipments. 

We believe it is important to provide patients with the highest quality customer support to achieve satisfaction with our products and optimal outcomes. As of December 31, 2015, we had a dedicated client services team of 33 people who were trained on our products, a clinical support team of 27 people who were licensed nurses or respiratory therapists, and a dedicated billing services team of 66 people. We provide our patients with a dedicated 24/7 hotline. Via the hotline, patients have direct access to our client services representatives, who can handle product-related questions. Additionally, clinical staff is on call 24/7 and available to patients whenever either the patient or the client services representative deems appropriate. Our dedicated billing services team is available to answer patient questions regarding invoicing, reimbursement, and account status during normal business hours. We receive no additional reimbursement for patient support, but provide high-quality customer service to enhance patient comfort, satisfaction, compliance, and safety with our products. We believe our focus on providing the highest level of customer service has helped drive our sustained patient satisfaction rating of approximately 94%. 

Third-party reimbursement 

Medicare or private insurance rentals represented approximately 29% of our revenue in 2015. In cases where we rent our oxygen therapy solutions directly to patients, we bill third-party payors, such as Medicare or private insurance, for monthly rentals on behalf of our patients. We process and coordinate all physician paperwork necessary for reimbursement of our solutions. A common medical criterion for oxygen therapy reimbursement is insufficient blood oxygen saturation level. Our team in sales and sales administration are trained on how to verify benefits, review medical records and process physician paperwork. Additionally, an independent internal review is performed and our products are not deployed until after physician paperwork is processed and reimbursement eligibility is verified and communicated to the patient. As of December 31, 2015, our direct-to-consumer inside sales administration groups consisted of 183 people. 

We are authorized by Medicare to bill for oxygen therapy, and we believe that more than 60% of oxygen therapy patients have Medicare coverage. Our Inogen One systems are reimbursed under the Healthcare Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes E1390 and E1392. Our Inogen At Home system is reimbursed under HCPCS code E1390. E1390 covers stationary/nocturnal oxygen therapy systems, while E1392 provides additional reimbursement for portable oxygen concentrators for the treatment of ambulatory patients. Even though E1390 is a stationary oxygen code, we bill under both the E1390 and E1392 codes for our portable oxygen concentrators, assuming that the patient qualifies for portable oxygen, as well as stationary oxygen. Only in the event the patient solely qualifies for 

&#160;

&#160;

portable oxygen would we exclusively bill under the E1392 code, which is not typical. Currently, Medicare reimburses oxygen therapy as a monthly rental for up to 36 months. We retain equipment ownership at all times. After 36 months, payment is &#8220;capped,&#8221; meaning the monthly payment amounts are discontinued. After two additional years or another qualifying event, the patient is eligible for replacement equipment and a new revenue-generating rental period begins. 

As of January 1, 2011, Medicare had phased in a program called competitive bidding. Competitive bidding impacts the amount Medicare reimburses suppliers for durable medical equipment rentals, including portable oxygen concentrators. The program is defined geographically, with suppliers submitting bids to provide medical equipment for a specific product category within that geography. Once bids have been placed, an individual company&#8217;s bids across products within the category are aggregated and weighted by each product&#8217;s market share in the category. The weighted-average price is then indexed against competitors. Medicare determines a &#8220;clearing price&#8221; out of these weighted-average prices at which sufficient suppliers have indicated they will support patients in the category, and this threshold is typically designed to generate theoretical supply that is twice the expected demand. Bids for each modality among the suppliers that made the cut are then arrayed to determine what Medicare will reimburse for each product category and geographic area. The program has strict anti-collusion guidelines to ensure bidding is truly competitive. Competitive bidding contracts last up to three years once implemented, after which they are subject to a new round of bidding. Discounts off the standard Medicare allowable occur in competitive bidding Metropolitan Statistical Areas where contracts have been awarded as well as in cases where private payors pay less then this allowable. Competitive bidding rates are based on the zip code where the patient resides. Rental revenue includes payments for product, disposables, and customer service/support. As of January 1, 2016, competitive bidding has been nationalized. All areas previously not subject to bidding had rate reductions applied instead of doing another bidding process. The fee schedules in the un-bid areas are adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts for areas already under competitive bidding. The regional prices are limited by a national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) and a floor (90% of the average regional prices). Since January 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates for these un-bid areas (with dates of services from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016) are based on 50% of the un-adjusted (current) fee schedule amount and 50% of the adjusted (reduced) fee schedule amount which is based on the regional competitive bidding rates. Starting on July 1, 2016, reimbursement rates will be 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount which will be based on regional competitive bidding rates, including any potential adjustments associated with competitive bidding round two re-compete.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines frontier states as states where more than 50% of the counties in the state have a population density of 6 people or less per square mile and rural states are defined as states where more than 50% of the population lives in rural areas per census data. Current frontier states include MT, ND, SD and WY; rural states include ME, MS, VT and WV; and non-contiguous United States areas include AK, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. For frontier and rural states, and frontier and rural zip codes in non-frontier/rural states, the single payment amount will be the national ceiling (110% of the average of the regional prices) to account for higher servicing costs in these areas. For non-contiguous United States areas, single payment amounts will be the higher of the national ceiling, or the average of competitive bidding pricing from these areas, if the areas had been bid through competitive bidding. We estimate that less than 10% of our patients will be eligible to receive the 110% of the regional prices for rural and frontier areas based on the geographic locations of our current patient population.

CMS has also re-bid for competitive bidding round two re-compete, associated with approximately 50% of the Medicare market with contracts set to begin July 1, 2016 and continue through December 31, 2018. CMS updated the product categories and the competitive bidding areas. Respiratory equipment includes oxygen, oxygen equipment, continuous positive airway pressure devices, respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories. Nebulizers are now their own separate product category instead of being included in the respiratory equipment category. Round two re-compete is in the same geographic areas that were included in the original round two. However, as a result of the Office of Management and Budget&#8217;s updates to the original 91 round two metropolitan statistical areas, there are now 90 metropolitan statistical areas for round two re-compete and 117 competitive bidding areas (CBAs). Any CBA that was previously located in multi-state metropolitan statistical areas was redefined so that no CBA is included in more than one state. The round two re-compete competitive bidding areas have nearly the same zip codes as the round two competitive 

&#160;

&#160;

bidding areas; the associated changes in the zip codes since competitive bidding was implemented are reflective in this round two re-compete. Pricing is expected to be announced in winter 2016 according to CMS, and will impact both the zip codes covered under round two and also the rates for the un-bid areas effective July 1, 2016. 

CMS has begun the bidding process for the round one 2017 contracts effective January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Bids were due by December 16, 2015. In round one 2017, there are 9 metropolitan statistical areas and 13 CBAs to make sure each CBA does not cross state boundaries. We estimate approximately 9% of the Medicare market will be impacted by these contracts set to begin January 1, 2017 and continue through December 31, 2018.

The following table sets forth the current Medicare standard allowable reimbursement rates and the weighted-average of reimbursement rates applicable in Metropolitan Statistical Areas covered by rounds one and two of competitive bidding. The round one re-compete was completed in the same Metropolitan Statistical Areas as round one for the next three-year period starting January 1, 2014 when the original contracts expired.

In addition to reducing the Medicare reimbursement rates in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas, the competitive bidding program has effectively reduced the number of oxygen suppliers that can participate in the Medicare program. We believe that more than 75% of existing oxygen suppliers were eliminated in round one of competitive bidding, which was implemented January 1, 2011 in 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Round two of competitive bidding was implemented July 1, 2013 in 91 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and we believe the impact on the number of oxygen suppliers was similar to round one. We believe that 59% of the market was covered by round one and round two of competitive bidding. 

Cumulatively in rounds one, two and round one re-compete, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the competitive bidding areas and products for which we submitted bids. However, there is no guarantee that we will garner additional market share as a result of these contracts. The contracts include products that may require us to subcontract certain services or products to third parties, which must be approved by CMS. 

Following round one of competitive bidding, we were excluded from the Kansas City-MO-KS, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, and Orlando-Kissimmee-FL competitive bidding areas and Honolulu-Hawaii, where we have never maintained a license. After round one re-compete of competitive bidding, we gained access to Kansas City-MO-KS and were excluded from the following competitive bidding areas: Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor-OH, Cincinnati-Middletown-OH, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano-FL, Orlando-Kissimmee-FL, Pittsburg-PA, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario-CA. After round two of competitive bidding, we were excluded from an additional 10 competitive bidding areas, including Akron-OH, Cape Coral-Fort Myers-FL, Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach-FL, Jacksonville-FL, Lakeland-Winter Haven-FL, North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota-FL, Ocala, Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville-FL, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater-FL and Toledo-OH. Collectively, we have incrementally lost access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market as of July 1, 2013. As a result, on a going forward basis we will continue to have access to approximately 90% of the Medicare market based on our analysis of the 92 competitive bidding areas that we have won out of the 109 competitive bidding areas, representing 59% of the market, with the remaining 41% of the market not subject to competitive bidding rounds and instead in these areas the rates are applied as discussed above. The incremental loss of access to approximately seven percent of the Medicare market is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our rental business. Medicare revenue, including patient co-insurance and deductible obligations, represented 21.0% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect the decline in total revenue resulting from the loss of competitive bidding contracts in the areas that we were excluded from to be partially offset by the &#8220;grandfathering&#8221; of existing Medicare patients, direct sales to former Medicare patients with third-party insurance coverage, or Medicare patients paying out-of-pocket to purchase our products. Our revenue from Medicare in the 17 competitive bidding areas where we were not offered contracts was approximately $0.5 million in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014.

Under the Medicare competitive bidding program, providers may &#8220;grandfather&#8221; existing patients on service up to the effective date of the competitive bidding round. This means providers may retain all existing patients and continue to receive reimbursement for 

&#160;

&#160;

them so long as the new reimbursement rate is accepted and the applicable beneficiary chooses to continue to receive equipment from the provider. Providers must either keep or release all patients under this &#8220;grandfathering&#8221; arrangement in each competitive bidding area; specific individual selection of patients for retention or release is not allowed. Providers can continue to sell equipment in competitive bid areas where they were not awarded contracts to patients paying out-of-pocket or with third-party insurance coverage. 

We have elected to &#8220;grandfather&#8221; and retain all patients in competitive bid areas where contracts were not awarded to us. In addition, we continue to accept patients in competitive bidding areas where we did not receive contracts through private insurance. We also pursue retail sales of our equipment to patients in those areas. 

Medicare reimbursement for oxygen rental equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month period and the equipment is always owned by the home oxygen provider. The provider that billed Medicare for the 36th month continues to be responsible for the patient&#8217;s oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and there is generally no additional reimbursement for oxygen generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse suppliers for oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the patient. The provider is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases CMS will reimburse for repair costs. After the five year useful life is reached, the patient may request replacement equipment and, if he or she can be re-qualified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle out of the next 60 months of service would begin. The provider may not arbitrarily issue new equipment. We have analyzed the potential impact to revenue associated with patients in the capped rental period and have deferred $0 associated with the capped rental period for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Our obligations to service assigned Medicare patients over the contract rental period include supplying working equipment that meets the patient&#8217;s oxygen needs pursuant to their doctor&#8217;s prescription and certificate of medical necessity form and supplying all disposables required for the patient to operate the equipment, including cannulas, filters, replacement batteries, carts and carry bags, as needed. If the equipment malfunctions, we must repair or replace the equipment. We determine what equipment the patient receives, that meets the physician&#8217;s prescription, and we can deploy used assets in working order as long as the prescription requirements are met. We must also procure a recertification of the certificate of medical necessity from the patient&#8217;s doctor to confirm the patient&#8217;s need for oxygen therapy one year after first receiving oxygen therapy and one year after each new 36-month reimbursement period begins. These contracts are cancellable by the patient at any time and by the provider in certain circumstances when the patient can transition to another provider. 

In addition to the adoption of the competitive bidding program, reimbursable fees for oxygen rental services in non-competitive bidding areas were eligible to receive mandatory annual Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, or CPI-U, updates beginning in 2010. For 2014, the CPI-U was +1.8%, but the multi-factor productivity adjustment, &#8220;adjustment&#8221;, was -0.8%, so the net result was a 1.0% increase in fee schedule payments in 2014 for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. However, the stationary oxygen equipment codes payment amounts, as required by statute, must be adjusted on an annual basis, as necessary, to ensure budget neutrality of the new payment class for oxygen generating portable equipment. Thus, the increase in allowable payment amounts for stationary oxygen equipment codes increased 0.5% from 2013 to 2014. For 2015, the CPI-U was +2.1%, but the adjustment was -0.6%, so the net result was a 1.5% increase in fee schedule payments in 2015 for stationary oxygen equipment for items and services not included in an area subject to competitive bidding. This does not apply for 2016 as the standard allowables were set based on regional averages of the competitive bidding prices as described previously.

In addition, the President&#8217;s proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2017 includes multiple provisions that could impact the Company if they were enacted. The budget proposed eliminating the 36-month cap for oxygen equipment and reducing the monthly payment amount for oxygen and oxygen equipment by the necessary percentage to be budget neutral. The Company&#8217;s patient population may materially differ from the Medicare population, which could lead to either more or less revenue if this is enacted. In addition, this would likely also impact the number of patients interested in a cash purchase and could increase rental patients and decrease out-of-pocket purchases. The proposed budget also proposes to extend the authority to require prior authorization to all Medicare fee-for-service items and services, particularly those that are at the highest risk for improper payment. The proposed budget also contains multiple provisions related to the Medicare appeals process including establishing a refundable filing fee (non-refundable if denied), providing the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals and Department Appeals Board Authority to use Recovery Audit Contractor collections, and increase minimum amount in controversy for administrative law judge adjudication of claims to equal the amount required for judicial review. In addition, this proposal includes the ability to remand appeals to the redetermination level with the introduction of new evidence and the ability to sample and consolidate similar claims for administrative efficiency.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 79 contracts with Medicaid and private payors. These contracts qualify us as an in-network provider for these payors. As a result, patients can rent or purchase our systems at the same patient obligation as other in-network oxygen providers. Based on our patient population, we believe at least 30% of all oxygen therapy patients are covered by private payors. Private payors typically provide reimbursement at 60% up to and above 100% of Medicare allowables for in-network plans, 

&#160;

&#160;

and private payor plans can have 36-month capped rental periods similar to Medicare although they typically do not. We anticipate that private payor reimbursement levels will generally be reset in accordance with Medicare payment amounts established through competitive bidding. 

We cannot predict the full extent to which reimbursement for our products will be affected by competitive bidding, the proposed budget for 2017, or by initiatives to reduce costs for private payors. We believe that we are well positioned to respond to the changing reimbursement environment because our product offerings are innovative, patient-focused and cost-effective. We have historically been able to reduce our costs through scalable manufacturing, better sourcing, continuous innovation, and reliability improvements, as well as innovations that reduce our product service costs by minimizing exchanges, such as user replaceable batteries and oxygen filtration cartridges. As a result of bringing manufacturing and assembly largely in-house and our commitment to driving efficient manufacturing processes, we have reduced our overall system cost by 45% from 2009 to 2015. We intend to continue to seek ways to reduce our cost of revenue through manufacturing and design improvements. 

Manufacturing and raw materials

We have been developing and refining the manufacturing of our Inogen One systems over the past ten years. While nearly all of our manufacturing and assembly process was originally outsourced, assembly of the manifold, compressor, sieve bed and concentrator is now conducted in-house in order to improve quality control and reduce cost. Additionally, we use lean manufacturing practices to maximize our manufacturing efficiency. 

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials, including electronic and mechanical components, batteries, materials, bearings, carry bags, motors, pistons, valves, and molded plastic components and other supplies. We rely on third- party manufacturers to supply several components of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity, quality requirements, and delivery terms, which, in certain cases, can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. We have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, motors, valves, and molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels, and to manage component quality. In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. If any single-source supplier were no longer able to supply a component, we believe we would be able to promptly and cost-effectively switch to an alternative supplier without a significant disruption to our business and operations. We have adopted additional contingency plans to protect against an immediate disruption in supply of our battery and motor components, and any potential delay that may result from a switch to a new supplier. These contingency plans include our own inventory management, along with a requirement that certain suppliers maintain specified quantities of inventory in multiple locations, as well as requiring certain manufacturers to maintain redundant manufacturing sites. We believe that these contingency plans would limit any disruption to our business in the event of an immediate termination of either our battery or motor supply. 

We currently manufacture in two leased buildings in Goleta, California and Richardson, Texas, that we have registered with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and for which we have obtained International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485 certification. The Goleta, California facility is approximately 39,000 square feet, and a subset is used for manufacturing activities. The Richardson, Texas manufacturing facility is approximately 37,000 square feet. We believe we have sufficient capacity to meet anticipated demand.

Our entire organization is responsible for quality management. Our Quality Assurance department oversees this by tracking component, device and organization performance and by training team members outside the Quality Assurance department to become competent users of our Quality Management system. By measuring component performance, communicating daily with the production group and our suppliers, and reviewing customer complaints, our Quality Assurance department, through the use of our corrective action program, drives and documents continuous performance improvement of our suppliers and internal departments. Our Quality Assurance department also trains internal auditors to audit our adherence to the Quality Management system. Our Quality Management system has been certified to ISO 13485:2012 by Intertek, a Notified Body to ISO. 

As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. We have been inspected four times since April 2012 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines. Most recently, our California facility was inspected by the FDA in March 2016. We have completed three surveillance audits and one certification audit by our notifying body over the same period and identified one minor non-conformance, which was addressed through implementation of new training software. Our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home system have received pre-market clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. The modifications made to our Inogen One G2 and Inogen One G3 systems represent non-significant modifications to the original Inogen One system, have the same indications for use, and are covered under our initial Inogen One 510(k) clearance. 

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 129 employees in operations, manufacturing, quality assurance and repair. 

Research and development 

We are committed to ongoing research and development to stay at the forefront of patient preference in the oxygen concentrator field. As of December 31, 2015, our research and development staff included 23 engineers and scientists with expertise in air separation, compressors, pneumatics, electronics, embedded software, mechanical design, sensors and manufacturing technologies. Our current research and development efforts are focused primarily on increasing functionality, improving design for ease-of-use, and reducing production costs of our Inogen One systems and Inogen At Home systems, as well as developing our next-generation oxygen concentrators. Over the last 3 fiscal years, Inogen has invested over $9.6 million in research and development to efficiently bring an upgrade to one of our portable oxygen concentrators and to introduce our first generation stationary oxygen concentrator to market ($4.2, $3.0 and $2.4 million for the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively), leveraging our twenty-eight issued U.S. patents and one Canadian patent while also reducing the product manufacturing costs 45% from 2009 to 2015. 

Utilizing lean product development methodologies, we have released four products over the last 10 years, including our Inogen One G1 in October 2004, our Inogen One G2 in March 2010, and our Inogen One G3 in September 2012 and our Inogen At Home system in October 2014. Our dedication to continuous improvement has also resulted in five mid-cycle product updates and numerous incremental improvements. Development projects utilize a combination of rapid prototyping and accelerated life testing methods to ensure products are taken from concept to commercialization in a fast and capital efficient manner. We leverage our direct patient expertise to rapidly gain insight from end users and to identify areas of innovation that we believe will lead to higher-quality products and lower total cost of ownership for our products. 

Our product pipeline consists of our fourth-generation, ultra-lightweight portable oxygen concentrator. Our fourth-generation portable oxygen concentrator will be smaller, lighter and less expensive to manufacture than our Inogen One G3 and we expect to commercialize this product in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, we continue to focus our efforts on other design and functionality improvements that enhance patient quality of life. 

Competition 

The oxygen therapy market is a highly competitive industry. We compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of portable oxygen concentrators, as well as providers of other oxygen therapy solutions such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders. 

Our significant manufacturing competitors are Invacare Corporation, Respironics (a subsidiary of Koninklijke Philips N.V.), AirSep Corporation and SeQual Technologies (subsidiaries of Chart Industries, Inc.), Inova Labs, Inc. (a subsidiary of ResMed), DeVilbiss Healthcare (a subsidiary of Drive Medical), and O2 Concepts. Given the relatively low barriers to entry in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, we expect that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. Manufacturing companies compete for sales to providers primarily on the basis of product features, service and price. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, due to our manufacturing competitors&#8217; complete reliance on home medical equipment distribution, which compresses their margins and limits their ability to invest in product features that address consumer preferences. To pursue a direct-to-consumer strategy, our manufacturing competitors would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing requirements and secure Medicare billing privileges, as well as compete directly with the home medical equipment providers that many rely on across their entire homecare businesses. For our two largest medical device competitors, the entire oxygen business for each, including stationary and transfilling concentrators, represents less than 15% percent of their billion-dollar plus homecare businesses in 2014. 

Lincare, Inc. (a subsidiary of the Linde Group), Apria Healthcare, Inc., Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and American HomePatient, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Lincare, Inc.) have been among the market leaders in providing oxygen therapy for many years, while the remaining oxygen therapy market is serviced by local providers. Because many oxygen therapy providers were either excluded from contracts in the Medicare competitive bidding process, or will have difficulty providing service at the prevailing Medicare reimbursement rates, we expect more industry consolidation. Oxygen therapy providers compete primarily on the basis of product features and service, rather than price, since reimbursement levels are established by Medicare and Medicaid, or by the individual determinations of private payors. We believe that the investment made by oxygen therapy providers in the physical distribution required for oxygen delivery limits their ability to easily switch their business model and employ a solution directly competitive to Inogen. 

&#160;

&#160;

Some of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more aggressively on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. Some of these competitors have: 

&#160;

&#183; 

significantly greater name recognition; 

&#160;

&#183; 

established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

established distribution networks; 

&#160;

&#183; 

additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage; 

&#160;

&#183; 

greater history in conducting research and development, manufacturing, marketing and obtaining regulatory approval for oxygen device products; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, patent litigation and customer financing. 

As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In light of these advantages that our competitors maintain, even if our technology and direct-to-consumer distribution strategy is more effective than the technology and distribution strategy of our competitors, current or potential customers might accept competitor products and services in lieu of purchasing our products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. Our ability to compete successfully and to increase our market share is dependent upon our reputation for providing responsive, professional and high-quality products and services and achieving strong customer satisfaction. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, margins and market share. 

Government regulation 

Inogen One systems, Inogen At Home systems and related accessories are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries. The FDA regulations govern the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses: product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, record keeping, product marketing, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, and post-marketing surveillance. 

FDA&#8217;s pre-market clearance and approval requirements 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or 501(k) clearance or a pre-market approval from the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring premarket approval. 

510(k) clearance pathway 

When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a pre-market approval application. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use, into Class III. We obtained 510(k) clearance for the original Inogen One system on May 13, 2004. We market the Inogen One G2 and G3 systems pursuant to the original Inogen One 510(k) clearance. We obtained 510(k) clearance for the Inogen At Home system on June 20, 2014.

&#160;

&#160;

Pre-market approval pathway 

A pre-market approval application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The pre-market approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A pre-market approval application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 

After a pre-market approval application is submitted and the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will accept the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review an &#8220;accepted&#8221; pre-market approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. 

Clinical trials 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, these trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 

Pervasive and ongoing regulation by the FDA 

Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

establishment registration and device listing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#160;

&#183; 

labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 

&#160;

&#183; 

corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance or a pre-market approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. We have modified various aspects of our Inogen One systems since receiving regulatory clearance, but we believe that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties. 

&#160;

&#160;

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted pre-market approvals. 

As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. We have been audited three times since April 2012 by the FDA and found to be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines. We have completed three surveillance audits and one certification audit by our notifying body over the same period and identified one minor non-conformance, which was addressed through implementation of new training software. 

International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 

Licensure 

In April 2009, we became an accredited Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Medicare supplier by Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our Goleta, California facility for Home/Durable Medical Equipment Services for oxygen equipment and supplies. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years by passing an on-site inspection. Our current accreditation with Medicare is due to expire in May 2018. Several states require that durable medical equipment providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an annual or bi-annual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be non-compliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified clinicians are in compliance with all such state laws. If our clinicians were to be found non-compliant in a given state, we would need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support and customer service in such state. 

Federal anti-kickback and self-referral laws 

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce the: 

&#160;

&#183; 

referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. 

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to our arrangements with sales representatives, customers and healthcare providers, as well as certain coding and billing information that we may provide to purchasers of our Inogen One and Inogen At Home systems. Although we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise. Non-compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute can result in cancellation of our provider numbers and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the &#8220;Stark Law,&#8221; which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing &#8220;designated health services,&#8221; which includes durable medical equipment, if the physician or immediate family member of the physician, has an ownership or investment interest or compensation arrangement with such entity that does not comply with the requirements of a Stark exception. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a non-compliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exceptions from the law. 

Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that 

&#160;

&#160;

these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law. 

Federal False Claims Act 

The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment to the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring &#8220;qui tam&#8221; or whistleblower lawsuits against companies. Although we believe that we are in compliance with the federal government&#8217;s laws and regulations, if we are found in violation of these laws, penalties include fines ranging from $.006 to $.011 million for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act. We believe that we are in compliance with the federal government&#8217;s laws and regulations concerning the filing of reimbursement claims. 

Civil monetary penalties law 

The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. We sometimes offer customers various discounts and other financial incentives in connection with the sales of our products. While it is our intent to comply with all applicable laws, the government may find that our marketing activities violate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. If we are found to be in non-compliance, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

State fraud and abuse provisions 

Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims act that may apply to all payors. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 

HIPAA 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as &#8220;covered entities.&#8221; Three standards have been promulgated under HIPAA&#8217;s regulations: the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. 

In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, which included sweeping changes to HIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, which, among other things, made HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities effective February 17, 2010. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information in connection with recognized healthcare operations activities. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that will likely make more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. 

In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned 

&#160;

&#160;

operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations. 

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on medical device manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $.15 million per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also requires healthcare providers to voluntarily report and return an identified overpayment within 60 days after identifying the overpayment. Failure to repay the overpayment within 60 days will result in the claim being considered a &#8220;false claim&#8221; and the healthcare provider will be subject to False Claims Act liability.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

International regulation 

International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. 

The primary regulatory body in Europe is the European Union, which has adopted numerous directives and has promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the European Conformity Marking, or CE Mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the European Union, and other countries that comply with or mirror these directives. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s device. Such an assessment may be required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certifications are voluntary standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Mark. We have the authorization to affix the CE Mark to our products and to commercialize our devices in the European Union. Our ISO 13485 certification was issued on April 21, 2005 and our EC-Certificate was issued on March 16, 2007. 

Before we can sell our devices in Canada we must submit a license application and obtain clearance, implement and comply with ISO Standard 13485, and undergo an audit by a registrar accredited by Health Canada. On January 25, 2006, we received our Medical Device License in Canada. In Australia, we must appoint an agent sponsor who will interact on our behalf with the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA). We must also prepare a technical file and declaration of conformity to essential requirements under Australian law, provide evidence of CE Marking of the device and submit this information via our agent sponsor to the TGA in a Medical Device Application. On June 4, 2007, we received our Certificate for Inclusion of a Medical Device in Australia. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 

Intellectual property 

We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage, we must develop and preserve the proprietary aspect of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute non-disclosure agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work on our current or future products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day, developed using our property or related to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Inogen One systems or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 

Patents 

As of December 31, 2015, we had twenty-eight issued U.S. patents, one issued Canadian patent and four additional pending U.S. patent applications relating to design and construction of our oxygen concentrators and our Intelligent Delivery Technology. We anticipate it will take several years for the most recent of these U.S. patent applications to result in issued patents, if successful. 

Our patent portfolio contains three principal sets of patents and patent applications. The first set relates to the construction and design of specific Inogen products. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,440,004; 8,366,815; 8,377,181; and 8,568,519 are directed to design elements of the Inogen One G2 portable oxygen concentrator. These patents expire in 2031 (without taking into account any patent term adjustments) and may serve to deter competitors from reverse engineering or copying our design elements. This set of patents and patent applications also contains a pending U.S. patent application that relates to the design of the Inogen One G3 portable oxygen concentrator. 

The second set of patents and patent applications within our portfolio pertains to operating algorithms and design optimization techniques. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,841,343; 7,585,351; 7,857,894; 8,142,544; and 6,605,136 are directed toward optimization of the Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen generating system and the oxygen conserving technology used across all of our products. These patents expire in 2027, 2026, 2027, 2026 and 2022 respectively (without taking into account any patent term adjustments). These algorithms and optimization techniques are developed to facilitate the design and manufacturing of our products. These patents may prevent competitors from achieving the same levels of optimization as found in our products. 

The third set of patents and patent applications includes system component designs that may be incorporated into our products. For example, U.S. Patent No. 8,580,015, which expires in 2027 (without taking into account any patent term adjustments), is directed to product improvements that have been utilized in the Inogen One and Inogen One G2 products. Also within this class of patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,686,870 and 7,922,789 that are directed to designs that may be utilized in future Inogen products to improve performance over current product offerings. These patents expire in 2027 and 2023 respectively (without taking into account any patent term adjustments). 

Trademarks 

&#8220;Inogen,&#8221; &#8220;Inogen One,&#8221; &#8220;Inogen One G2,&#8221; &#8220;Inogen One G3,&#8221; &#8220;Oxygenation,&#8221; &#8220;Live Life in Moments, not Minutes,&#8221; &#8220;Never Run Out of Oxygen,&#8221; &#8220;Oxygen Therapy on Your Terms,&#8221; &#8220;Oxygen.Anytime.Anywhere,&#8221; &#8220;Reclaim Your Independence,&#8221; &#8220;Intelligent Delivery Technology,&#8221; &#8220;Inogen At Home,&#8221; and the Inogen design are registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office of Inogen, Inc. We own trademark registrations for the mark &#8220;Inogen&#8221; in Australia, Canada, South Korea, Mexico, and Europe (European Union registration). We own pending applications for &#8220;Inogen&#8221; in Japan and South Korea, and we own a pending application for &#8220; &#12452;&#12494;&#12472;&#12455;&#12531; &#8221; in Japan. We own trademark registrations for the mark &#8220;Inogen One&#8221; in Australia, Canada, China, South Korea, Mexico, and Europe (European Union registration). We own trademark registrations for the mark &#8220;Satellite Conserver&#8221; in Canada and China. We own a trademark registration for the mark &#8220;Inogen At Home&#8221; in Europe (European Union Registration). Other service marks, trademarks, and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 547 full and part-time employees, including 274 in sales, marketing, clinical and client services, 129 in operations, manufacturing, quality assurance and repair, 121 in general administration and 23 in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

Environmental matters 

Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, and corrosives. Our research and manufacturing operations produce hazardous chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations. 

Backlog 

We run our operations on a just-in-time basis. We do not have a backlog of orders that could not be fulfilled by our ordinary course of business. 

Geographic information

During the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States. Approximately 22% of our 2015, 2014 and 2013 revenue came from international markets. See Note 2 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our U.S. and non-U.S. revenue. 

Seasonality

We believe our sales may be impacted by seasonal factors. For example, we typically experience higher sales in the second quarter, as a result of consumers traveling and vacationing during warmer weather in the spring and summer months. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the second quarter accounted for 28.5%, 28.0% and 28.4%, respectively of our total sales revenue.
