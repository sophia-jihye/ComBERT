BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General Description 

&#160; 

CKX Lands, Inc. is a Louisiana corporation organized in 1930 as Calcasieu Real Estate &#38; Oil Co., Inc., to receive non-producing mineral royalties spun off by a southwest Louisiana bank. Over the years, as some of the royalties yielded oil and gas income, the Company used the proceeds to purchase land. On May 17, 2005, the Company changed its name from Calcasieu Real Estate &#38; Oil Co., Inc. to CKX Lands, Inc. The primary reason for the change was to help clarify that the Company is not directly involved in oil and gas exploration or operations. As used herein, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;CKX&#8221; refers to CKX Lands, Inc. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s shares are listed on the NYSE MKT (previously known as NYSE AMEX), under the symbol CKX. As of March 24, 2016, there were 1,942,495 shares outstanding. The Company had a common equity public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter. Consequently, the Company is a small reporting company under the Securities Exchange Commission regulations. 

&#160; 

As a reporting company, CKX is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and accordingly files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). The public may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549. Please call the SEC at (800) SEC-0330 for further information on the Public Reference Room. As an electronic filer, CKX&#8217;s public filings are maintained on the SEC&#8217;s Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. 

&#160; 

The Company will provide to stockholders without charge upon their written request a copy of the registrant&#39;s annual report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the financial statement schedules, required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registrant&#39;s most recent fiscal year. Requests should be sent to Brian Jones, President, CKX Lands, Inc., 1508 Hodges Street, Lake Charles, LA 70601. 

&#160; 

The Company owns land, timber, and mineral interests and collects income through its ownership in the form of oil and gas royalties, timber sales, and surface leases for farming, right of way and other uses. The Company is not involved in the exploration or production of oil and gas nor does it actively farm its lands. 

&#160; 

CKX owns a 100% interest in 6,389 acres and undivided interests ranging from 0.260% to 88.889% in 38,080 acres, including a 16.667% interest in 33,715 acres and a 50.000% interest in 1,775, resulting in an ownership of approximately 13,195 net acres. 

&#160; 

CKX does not perform or cause to have performed oil and gas producing activities inasmuch as: (1) we do not search for crude oil or natural gas in their natural states; (2) we do not acquire property for the purpose of exploration or the removing of oil and gas; and (3) we are not involved in construction, drilling and/or production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas. 

&#160; 

Oil and gas royalties are paid by the operators who own the wells. Timber income is paid by the highest bidder for the timber. There are several mills in the immediate area that compete for timber. Surface income is received for farming, right of way or other surface land uses. The prices paid for oil, gas and timber depend on national and international market conditions. Prices paid for surface leases depend on regional and local market conditions. Oil and gas revenues were 74.023% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues in 2015 and 56.660% in 2014. 

&#160; 

The source of all raw materials for the Company is the land itself. All oil and gas income will eventually deplete, but we have no access to this depletion information. Timber income and agriculture income are renewable resources. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company does not spend any money on Research and Development. 

&#160; 

The Company does not need government approval of its principal products or services except that the State of Louisiana must approve the size &#38; location of all oil and gas producing units. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company has three employees, all of whom are part-time. There are two officers, and one clerical person. The Company is subject to no union contracts nor does the Company have any hospitalization, pension, profit sharing, option or deferred compensation programs. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s customers are those who have mineral leases on Company lands, purchase timber in competitive bids or execute surface leases for farm or other purposes. During 2015, the Company received approximately 72.210% of its total revenues from the following customers:

Loss of cash receipts from any of these customers or revenue streams would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

The operators of the wells are responsible for complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. However, should an operator abandon a well located on Company land without following prescribed procedures, the land owners could possibly be held responsible. The Company does not believe this would have a material effect on its financial condition.
