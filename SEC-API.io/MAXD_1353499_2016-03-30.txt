 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Max Sound Corporation (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. The total of 100,000 shares represents 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock at the time of the transfer. As a result, Mr. Halpern became our sole shareholder. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Michael Raleigh, our then President, CEO, CFO, and Chairman resigned from all the positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO CFO and Chairman. The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern in September of 2008 and began when he joined the Company on October 7, 2008. In October 2008, we became a development stage company focused on creating an Internet search engine and networking web site. 

&#160;

From October 2008 until January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern was our CEO, and during that time the Company was focused on developing their Internet search engine and networking web site. In January of 2010, the Company launched their Internet search engine and networking website. In 2011, the Company decided to abandon its social networking website. On May 11, 2010, the Company acquired the worldwide rights, title, and interest to all fields of use for MAX-D.

&#160;

On January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern resigned as the Company&#8217;s CEO and John Blaisure was appointed as CEO. In February of 2011, the Company elected to change its business operations and focus primarily on developing and launching the MAX-D technology. Our current website (www.maxsound.com) is used to showcase the MAX-D technology. On March 8, 2011, the Company changed its name to Max Sound Corporation, and its trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board to MAXD.

&#160;

MAX Sound Corporation owns the worldwide rights to all fields of use to MAX-D HD Audio, which was invented by Lloyd Trammell, a top sound designer and audio engineer who helped develop and sell the first working Surround Sound System to Hughes Aircraft. Mr. Trammell, also developed MIDI for Korg and owns five patents in dimensional sound processing. We believe that MAX-D is to Audio what High Definition is to Video. MAX-D works by converting all audio files to their highest possible acoustically perfect equivalent without increasing files size or bandwidth usage.

&#160;

On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue

&#160; 

&#160; 

violators of Eli Attia&#8217;s intellectual property rights. MAXD has since filed suit against Google, Inc., Flux Factory, and various executives of these companies for misappropriation of trade secrets.

&#160;

No later than June 20, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with VSL Communications, Inc., making MAXD the exclusive agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to patented technology owned and controlled by VSL. In particular, the Company announced that it had acquired a worldwide license and representation rights to a patented video and data technology &#8220;Optimized Data Transmission System and Method&#8221; which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represents thirty three times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be viewed by an end-user. As described more fully in the Legal Proceedings Section, The Company has since filed suit against Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., alleging willful infringement of the patent.

&#160;

On June 20, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Santok LTD of United Kingdom (&#8220;Santok). The term of the agreement is three years. Santok will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product. Santok guarantees to the Company a minimum total of 150,000 cumulative licensed product installation with a minimum total guaranteed value of $225,000 over the three years of the agreement. If the total royalty paid is less than the guaranteed value, Santok will pay the difference.

&#160;

On July 13, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Luna Mobile, Inc. of United States (&#8220;Luna). The term of the agreement is three years. Luna will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product manufactured and sold.

&#160;

&#160;

Description of Our Business 

&#160;

Max Sound (MAX-D) is engaged in activities to sell and license products and services based on its patent-pending MAX-D HD Audio Technology for sound recording and playback that dramatically improves the listener&#8217;s experience. The MAXD-D HD Audio Technology delivers high definition audio without increasing file size. 

&#160;

The Company is marketing MAX-D on the basis that it is to audio what HD is to video. MAX-D technology improves all types of audio; moreover, it is intended to be particularly valuable in improving the ever-growing use of compressed audio and video as used in mp3 files, iPods, internet, and satellite/terrestrial broadcasting. For example, a listener using a portable mp3 player with MAX-D will experience sound quality that is comparable to the original CD before it was converted into an mp3 file. In another example, cell phone users using a cell phone equipped with MAX-D will hear the other person's voice as if they are speaking directly in front of them. The Company believes that the MAX-D HD is better for a consumers hearing than today&#8217;s highly compressed audio and anticipate that continued research and development will support the Company&#8217;s position. In numerous consumer audio tests, MAXD-D HD sounded better to consumers than high resolution WAV files. Importantly, MAX-D HD remains one tenth the size of a WAV file, and in the Company&#8217;s opinion offers more clarity, dimension, articulation and impact in every range of the audio spectrum to the listener The Company&#8217;s current business model is to license the technology to content creators, manufacturers, and network broadcasters. The Company&#8217;s patent-pending technology stands customer ready today. The Company&#8217;s market pursuits include motion picture, music recording, video game, broadcasting, internet video and audio, automobile infotainment systems and consumer electronics. 

&#160;

The Company has a small and efficient staff of 10, including employees and sub-contractors, which has established business relationships with the leading companies in the Smartphone, Tablet, Chip, Music and Consumer Retail business. The Company is now executing its &#8220;Go To Market&#8221; strategy and sales programs as a first market mover solving the degraded compressed audio issues plaguing the audio currently being consumed. These companies dominate the multi-media and electronics technology arena providing audio delivery across all channels of the exploding smartphone tablet device phenomenon.

&#160; 

Qualcomm 

&#160;

The Company continues to pursue and renew its license with Qualcomm that enables our MAX-D technology to be on Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon DSP. The license agreement is automatically renewable for one-year periods unless terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice. By residing on the Qualcomm Snapdragon DSP, the MAX-D HD Audio Technology will have the ability to control and convert to HD Audio up to 8 audio processes simultaneously. This will include Cellular Voice transmission and termination, streaming video, streaming audio and all content stored on the device in memory. Qualcomm currently has a significant portion of the entire global chip market for all smartphones and tablets and they believe their growth rate mirrors the industry. We anticipate a strong adoption from the OEMs licensing the MAX-D technology. Now that MAX-D is part of the Snapdragon Chip, we believe MAX-D can be successfully deployed on the chip, and will have the ability to be offered to Qualcomm&#8217;s OEM&#8217;s on potentially hundreds of millions of devices every quarter.

&#160;

Since the Company&#8217;s debut at the Qualcomm Upling conference in San Diego, we remain engaged with some of the largest OEM&#8217;s in the smart phone device market. Our sales and marketing team are continuing in advanced high-level strategic meetings with industry leaders in

&#160; 

&#160; 

the chip manufacturing and device hardware sectors. The Company is operating under several NDA&#8217;s and R&#38;D Test Agreements with today&#8217;s most well known industry to implement and license the MAX-D HD onto their platforms.

&#160;

About MAX-D: 

&#160;

The MAX-D software improves the sound heard from any device. Consumers have unknowingly sacrificed better audio quality for portable convenience and MAX-D rectifies this problem by:

&#160;

analyzing what content is missing from the compressed audio signal; dynamically resynthesizing lost harmonics and natural sound fields in real time; maximizing the output potential of any device without increasing original file size; and without requiring consumers or OEM&#8217;s to change equipment or infrastructure.

&#160;

&#160;

MAX-D Benefits: Increases dynamic range, eliminates destructive effects of audio compression with no increase in file size or transmission bandwidth; High-resolution audio reproduction with an omni-directional sound field using only two speakers; &#8220;Real&#8221; three-dimensional sound field, versus artificial sound field created by competing technologies; and More realistic &#8220;live performance&#8221; quality of all recordings with optimal dynamic range, bass response and overall clarity

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

MAX-D Markets: 

&#160;

MAX-D can be used in a variety of venues and applications that provide audio capability, as categorized below:

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; MOBILE - Communication | Voice &#8211; Data | Entertainment 

&#183; &#160; ENTERTAINMENT - Music | Movies | Audiobooks | Streaming Content | Live Events 

&#183; &#160; MULTI-MEDIA - Computing | Gaming 

&#183; &#160; CONSUMER - Home Theater | Portable Audio Players | Live Concert Sound | Automotive 

&#160;

We intend to license the MAX-D technology to creators of film, music, broadcast, and gaming content and selling them the service of applying the MAX-D technology to their end product. MAX-D is fully compatible with existing playback technology. We believe that no current competitor can provide the level of sound quality and end user experience that MAX-D delivers. MAX-D technology is ready for these markets now. We also intend to license the technology to manufacturers of consumer electronics products such as portable mp3 players, TV&#8217;s, Set Top Boxes, Car Stereo, Home Theatre, Smartphones and Tablets.

&#160;

The Company is making positive inroads in the motion picture industry. Many of the post-production facilities are now requesting a MAX-D HD Box. The Max-D HD box is a small Windows-based computer that allows audio engineers to apply our patent pending MAX-D HD Audio technology to protect the original audio quality as it is compressed and distributed downstream throughout the internet in all compressed formats. We now have internal testing boxes completed, and anticipate delivering the first boxes to several markets in Q3 2016, and one of the top post film production houses is now engaged with us negotiating their first feature film deal to employ MAX-D HD Audio.

&#160;

MAX-D Revenue Model: 

&#160;

The Company expects to derive its revenue through the licensing of its MAX-D technology. The Company is negotiating the licensing of its HD Audio Technology onto hardware and software across the primary vertical markets in Entertainment, Multi-media and Mobile Communications technology. 

In 2015, the Company nearly tripled its Mobile App user base (with no dedicated marketing budget being employed &#8211;until we expect later in 2016). We currently have over 200,000 subscribers on the free version of our HD Audio App for MP3&#8217;s on Android andApple which supports iPhones and iPads.

&#160;

In addition, the Company anticipates a Q2 2016 launch of a new streaming capable freemium app. This app which would offer millions of consumers a Max-D HD Audio experience with several revenue producing subscription add-ons and upgrades.

&#160;

MAX-D Embedded Chip Solution: The MAX-D Embedded Chip technology is being designed to restore the natural sound field, causing compressed audio to sound like the original audio at playback time in any device. The audio does not have to be pre-processed or encoded. The Chip is being designed to be imbedded into TV Receivers, Digital Projection TVs, LCD TVs, Plasma TVs, Component DVD Players/Recorders, DVD Recorders, Set-Top Boxes, Personal Video Recorders (PVRs), Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) Receivers, Personal Computers, Satellite Radio Receivers, Mobile Video Devices, Domestic Factory Installed Auto Sound, Camcorders, MP3 Players, Electronic Gaming Hardware, Wireless Telephones, Cell Phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).

&#160;

MAX-D Dynamic Software Module: Max Sound has delivered and is working to implement an application programming interface (&#8220;API&#8221;) for all Internet applications to process all audio/video content streamed or downloaded by consumers. Viable target candidates within the next 24 months include streaming movie and music services. Companies selling downloaded MP3&#8217;s are also expected to find immense value in our technology due to their dominance in web-based audio and video. This Module is a lossless dynamic process requiring no destructive encoding or decoding and needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing. In addition, no specialized decoder is necessary on any audio system.

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160;

MAX-D is a unique approach to processing sound, based on the physics of acoustics rather than electronics. Remarkably simple to deploy, MAX-D is a new technology that dramatically raises the standard for sound quality, &#160; with no corresponding increase in file size or transmission channel bandwidth. This is accomplished by processing audio with our proprietary, patent-pending process. This embedded and duplicating format either remains the same, or can be converted to whatever format the user desires, while retaining unparalleled fidelity and dynamic range.

&#160;

MAX-D restores the original recorded acoustical space in &#160; any listening environment. MAX-D is the only technology that both aligns phase and corrects phase distortion in a completed recording. MAX-D supplies missing audio content by adding acoustics and frequency response lost in the original recording or in the compression and transmission processes. MAX-D corrects and optimizes harmonic content and low frequency responses, greatly enhancing acoustic accuracy and we believe reduces ear fatigue.

&#160; MAX-D integrates time, phase, harmonics, dynamics, and sub-harmonic region optimizations in a fully dynamic fashion. MAX-D is a lossless dynamic process, requiring no destructive encoding/decoding process, or any specialized decoder at all. MAX-D needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing. &#160; The end result is that every aspect of audio processed with MAX-D - voice, instrument, or special effects - sounds refreshingly clear, realistic, and natural. The MAX-D HD Audio Technology creates an optimum sound field throughout every listening environment &#8211; from the corners of a theater; on your living room couch; to the back seat of your car.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

MAX-D HD Audio Technology requires no equipment changeover and can be embedded into any product (e.g. speakers, headphones, mobile devices), or online content delivery systems (e.g. streaming, cable, video games) to provide better sounding audio.

&#160;

Market 

&#160;

MAX-D products and services are designed and intended to solve problems and add value to audio components of several separate industries, including consumer electronics, motion picture, broadcasting, video game, recording, cell phone, internet, and VOIP applications.

&#160;

The Company is now positioned to pursue the following expansion strategies:

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Re-launch MAX-D audio on the Qualcomm Snapdragon DSP, which stands to make MAX-D audio available on potentially hundreds of millions of devices that can be licensed OEMs around the world. 

&#183; &#160; Grow the MAX-D HD Audio Apps user base and begin selling a paid version of the App. 

&#183; &#160; Deploy MAX-D APIs for use in streaming online Video/Audio and stand-alone Audio services. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s management believes there are no current competitors capable of delivering the high quality of audio products and services produced by the company. Although other companies, like DTS or Dolby, have technologies that enhance sound; we do not believe these technologies negatively affect the Company because the MAX-D process can enhance the other audio company&#8217;s technology.

&#160;

We believe we will be considered friendly competition in the future for three reasons; (1) we believe that MAX-D technology delivers the best sound quality available today, (2) MAX-D does not require any additional equipment; and (3) MAX-D makes any competition&#8217;s audio processes sound better.

&#160;
