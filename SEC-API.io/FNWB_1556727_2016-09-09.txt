 Item 1. Business 

General 

First Northwest Bancorp ("First Northwest" or the "Company"), a Washington corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the bank holding company for First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles ("First Federal" or the "Bank") in connection with the Bank's conversion from the mutual to stock form of ownership, which was completed on January 29, 2015. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016 , we had total assets of $1.0 billion , total deposits of $723.3 million , and total shareholders' equity of $189.7 million . The Company's business activities are generally limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Federal. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to First Federal. 

First Northwest is a bank holding company and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). First Federal is examined and regulated by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banks (&#8220;DFI&#8221;) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). First Federal is required to have certain reserves set by the Federal Reserve and is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (&#8220;FHLB&#8221; or &#8220;FHLB of Des Moines&#8221;), which is one of the 11 &#32;regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (&#8220;FHLB System&#8221;). 

First Federal is a community-oriented financial institution primarily serving the North Olympic Peninsula region of Washington. We have ten full-service banking offices, including a new full-service banking office that was opened during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 in Bellingham, Washington, which is located in Whatcom County. In addition, we anticipate opening a second full-service location in Bellingham, Washington and a Home Lending Center in Seattle, Washington during the first half of fiscal 2017. We offer a wide range of products and services focused on the lending and depository needs of the communities we serve. Historically, lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of first lien one- to four-family mortgage loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, construction and land loans (including lot loans), commercial business loans, and consumer loans, consisting primarily of automobile loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. During the past decade, recognizing our need to adapt to changing market conditions, we have revised our operating strategy to diversify our loan portfolio, expand our deposit product offerings and enhance our infrastructure. We have increased our originations of commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans and are focused on increasing originations of one- to four-family residential loans held for sale. We have historically offered traditional consumer and business deposit products, including transaction accounts, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit for individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. Deposits are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. 

&#160; 

The executive office of the Company is located at 105 West 8th Street, Port Angeles, Washington 98362, and its telephone number is (360) 457-0461.

Our business plan includes the intent to extend our operations further into the Puget Sound Region of Washington. The Puget Sound region dominates the economy of the Pacific Northwest and is broadly defined as the area surrounding the inlet of the Pacific Ocean that extends into the northwestern section of the state of Washington. The population of this additional region (beyond our current market area) approximates 4.2 million , or 58.6% &#32;of the state's population. The market area is a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas, with the Seattle metropolitan area harboring a well-developed urban area along the eastern portion of Puget Sound. The region extends from Whatcom County in the north on the Canadian border to Thurston and Pierce counties to the south. Other key metropolitan areas within the Puget Sound region include Bellingham (Whatcom County), Burlington (Skagit County), Everett (Snohomish County), Tacoma (Pierce County) and Olympia, the state capital (Thurston County). 

Key employment sectors include aerospace, military, information technology, clean technology, biotechnology, education, logistics, international trade and tourism. The region is well known for the long-term presence of The Boeing Corporation and Microsoft, two major industry leaders. The military presence includes a number of large installations serving the U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy. Given the employment profile, the region's workforce is generally highly educated. Washington's geographic proximity to the Pacific Rim along with a deep water port has made it a center for international trade as well, which contributes significantly to the regional 

economy (one in three jobs in Washington is tied to foreign exports). The Washington ports make Washington the fourth largest exporting state in the nation, and the top five trading partners with Washington include China, Mexico, Canada, Japan and Korea. Tourism has also developed into a major industry for the area, due to the scenic beauty, temperate climate, and easy accessibility. Maritime industry employment, supported by the trade and fishing industries, is also an important employment sector. 

The regional economy has had a historical dependence on the aerospace industry, which has had periods of strong growth as well as reductions in activity. Over the past few years, growth rates have been steady and long-term growth trends are favorable as the market area continues to maintain a highly educated and motivated workforce, and the Puget Sound region remains a desirable place to live. In the most recent periods, similar to national trends, most of the Puget Sound region has largely recovered from the prior issues related to home value declines, foreclosure rates, and other real estate related problems that were a result of the national recession of 2007-2009.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Lending. &#32;&#32;At June 30, 2016 , one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (excluding loans held for sale) totaled $308.5 million , or 49.3% , of our gross loan portfolio, including $52.2 million , or 16.9% , of loans secured by properties outside the state of Washington, primarily in the states of California, Ohio, and Oregon. We originate both fixed and adjustable-rate loans, which can be sold in the secondary market or retained in our residential portfolio, and supplement our originations with bulk loan purchases from time to time, depending on our balance sheet objectives. Residential loans are underwritten to secondary market standards or to other acceptable underwriting standards, which may not meet all of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") and Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") eligibility requirements. 

Fixed-rate residential mortgages are offered with repayment terms between 10 &#32;and 30 &#32;years, and we use Freddie Mac posted daily pricing, as well as other economic considerations, to establish pricing for our residential mortgage loans. Adjustable-rate residential mortgage products with similar amortization terms are also offered; however, the interest rate is typically fixed for an initial period. For example, the interest rate and payment will remain fixed between one &#32;to seven &#32;years with annual adjustments thereafter. Future interest rate adjustments are usually limited to increases or decreases of no more than 2% &#32;per adjustment and carry a typical lifetime cap of 5% &#32;to 6% &#32;above the initial interest rate, with no &#32;borrower prepayment restrictions. Currently, we are retaining adjustable-rate mortgages that we originate in our portfolio. 

Borrower demand for adjustable-rate mortgage loans typically increases when borrowers expect lower mortgage rates in the future. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans could increase credit risk because as interest rates rise, the borrower&#8217;s payments rise, increasing the potential for default. In addition, adjustable-rate mortgages may be offered with an initial discounted rate, which may be less than the fully indexed rate and lower than comparable fixed-rate loans, which could also contribute to a higher risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure when the interest rate and payment on the loan adjusts. To mitigate and balance this risk for both the borrower and First Federal, these loans usually contain both periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount of payment changes. In addition, depending on market conditions, we may underwrite the borrower at a higher interest rate and payment amount than the initial discount rate. We do not offer adjustable-rate mortgages with deep discount teaser rates. At June 30, 2016 , the average interest rate on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans was approximately 2.5% &#32;under the fully indexed rate. As of June 30, 2016 , we had $109.5 million , or 17.5% , of adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans in our residential loan portfolio. 

Residential loans are evaluated at the time they are originated using underwriting criteria that meet the Freddie Mac Loan Prospector guidelines, other than loans guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which we began originating in July 2013. This underwriting process considers a variety of factors including, but not limited to, credit history, debt to income ratios, property type, loan to value ratio, and occupancy. For loans with over 80% &#32;loan to value ratios, we typically require private mortgage insurance, which reduces our loan to value risk exposure in the event of a default on the loan and liquidation of the collateral for repayment. Other tools we use to reduce credit risk include, but are not limited to, title insurance, hazard insurance and flood insurance as required under current regulations. Residential mortgage loans which require appraisals are appraised by independent fee appraisers approved by First Federal who submit documentation to First Federal in order to complete a formal review in conjunction with the loan approval. 

In connection with the new rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which includes a definition for &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; loans based on the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan, we believe that generally all of the mortgage loans approved by First Federal meet this standard. 

First Federal does not actively engage in subprime lending, either through advertising, marketing, underwriting and/or risk selection, and has no established program to originate or purchase subprime loans to be held in its portfolio. 

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending. &#32;&#32;At June 30, 2016 , $161.2 million , or 25.7% , and $46.1 million , or 7.4% , of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate property, respectively. At June 30, 2016 , we have identified $35.8 million &#32;of our commercial real estate portfolio as owner-occupied commercial real estate, which includes properties used for the following purposes: vehicle dealerships of $9.4 million, health care of $7.9 million , manufacturing of $3.4 million, retail of $2.4 million , office buildings of $2.3 million and all other categories of $10.4 million. The remaining $171.5 million &#32;is secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied, commercial real estate, which includes properties used for the following purposes: multi-family of $46.1 million, retail of $42.6 million, hospitality of $19.3 million, self-storage of $15.1 million, health care of $13.8 million, warehouse of $12.9 million, office buildings of $12.5 million, and all other 

categories of $9.1 million. Substantially all of our commercial real estate and multi-family loans are primarily secured by properties located in Washington State. 

These loans are generally priced at a higher rate of interest than one- to four-family residential loans, as these loans have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Repayment on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties is dependent on successful management or utilization of the land and improvements by the property owner to create gross revenues and sufficient net operating income to meet the debt service requirements and provide a return to the owner. Changes in economic and real estate market conditions can affect net operating income, capitalization rates, and ultimately the valuation and marketability of the collateral. As a result, we analyze market data including, but not limited to, vacancy rates, absorption percentages, leasing rates, and competing projects under development. Interest rate, occupancy and capitalization rate stress testing are required as part of our underwriting analysis. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals, which include underwriting of their personal financial statements, tax returns, cash flows and individual credit reports, which provides us with additional support and a secondary source for repayment of the debt. 

We offer both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans on commercial and multi-family real estate, which may include balloon loans. As of June 30, 2016 , we had $115.1 million &#32;in adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans and $36.5 million &#32;in adjustable-rate multi-family loans. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans with adjustable rates generally adjust after an initial period of three &#32;to five years. These loans generally have maturity dates between three &#32;and 10 &#32;years. Amortization terms are generally limited to terms up to 25 &#32;years on commercial real estate loans and up to 30 &#32;years on multi-family loans. Adjustable-rate multi-family residential and commercial real estate loans are generally priced to market indices with appropriate margins, which may include the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury Rate, LIBOR, The Wall Street Journal prime rate, or other acceptable index. Substantially all adjustable-rate commercial and multi-family real estate loans are subject to a floor rate, and the weighted average floor rate on these loans was 4.14% &#32;at June 30, 2016 . Of all of the adjustable-rate commercial loans, 65% &#32;are subject to a ceiling rate, and the weighted average ceiling rate on those loans was 4.78% &#32;at June 30, 2016 . 

The maximum loan to value ratio for commercial and multi-family real estate loans is typically limited to 75% &#32;of the appraiser opinion of market value or determined by the income to debt service ratio, which is 1.20x &#32;for non-owner-occupied and owner-occupied properties. In addition, aggregate debt service ratios, including the guarantor&#8217;s cash flow and the borrower&#8217;s other projects, are required by policy to have a minimum income to debt service ratio of 1.20x . We require independent appraisals or evaluations on all loans secured by commercial real estate from an approved appraisers list. 

We require most of our commercial and multi-family real estate loan borrowers to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections with pictures to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. All commercial real estate loans over $750,000 &#32;are reviewed at least annually along with each commercial real estate borrower and, as applicable, each guarantor. The loan and its borrowers and/or guarantors are subject to an annual risk certification verifying that the loan is properly risk rated based upon covenant compliance and other terms as provided for in the loan agreements. While this process does not prevent loans from becoming delinquent, it does provide us with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent.

If we foreclose on a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 

The average outstanding loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio was $870,000 &#32;as of June 30, 2016 . We generally target individual commercial real estate loans between $250,000 &#32;and $10.0 million &#32;to small and mid-size owners and investors in our market areas as well as other parts of Washington. We will also make commercial real estate loans in other states if we have a pre-existing relationship with the borrower. &#32; 

Our three largest commercial and multi-family borrowing relationships at June 30, 2016 &#32;consisted of a $12.7 million &#32;relationship secured primarily by a warehouse in King County, an $11.9 million &#32;relationship secured by a hotel in King County, and an $11.5 million &#32;relationship secured primarily by self-storage facilities located in King, Pierce, and Thurston counties. 

Construction and Land Lending. &#32;Our construction and land loans increased $31.2 million , or 163.2% , to $50.4 million , or 8.0% , of the total loan portfolio at June 30, 2016 &#32;compared to $19.1 million &#32;at June 30, 2015 . This increase over the past year reflects our strategic decision to focus on increasing construction loan origination activity as real estate values and general economic conditions in our market areas continued to improve. 

First Federal offers an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; residential adjustable-rate custom construction loan product, which upon completion of the construction phase may be placed in our loan portfolio . We also originate construction loans for certain commercial real estate projects. These projects include, but are not limited to, subdivisions, multi-family, retail, office/warehouse, hotel, and office buildings. Underwriting criteria on these loans include, but are not limited to, minimum debt service coverage requirements of 1.20x &#32;or better, loan to value limitations, pre-leasing requirements, construction cost over-run contingency reserves, interest and absorption period reserves, occupancy, capitalization rates and interest rate stress testing, as well as other underwriting criteria. 

Construction loan applications require the borrower to provide architectural and working plans, a material specifications list, detailed cost breakdown and a construction contract. Construction loan advances are based on progress payments for &#8220;work in place&#8221; based on detailed line item construction budgets. Independent construction inspectors are used to evaluate the construction draw request relative to the progress and &#8220;work in place.&#8221; Our construction administrator reviews all construction projects, inspection reports and construction loan advance requests to ensure they are appropriate and in compliance with all loan conditions. Other risk management tools include title insurance, date down endorsements or periodic lien inspections prior to the payment of construction loan advances. In some cases, general contractors may be required to provide sub-contractor lien releases for any work performed prior to the filing of our deed of trust or prior to each construction loan advance. 

Construction lending for custom construction as well as speculative construction requires additional underwriting measures to effectively manage the construction process and future collateral value. Valuations on construction loans are based on the assumption that the finished improvements will be built in strict accordance with plans and specifications submitted to us at the time of the loan application. The appraiser must take into consideration the proposed design and market appeal of the improvements, based on current market conditions and demand for homes, although the improvements may not be completed for six to 12 months or longer, depending on the complexity of the plans and specifications and market conditions. 

Land acquisition, development and construction loans are available on a limited basis to local contractors and developers for the purpose of holding and/or developing residential building sites and homes when market conditions warrant such activity. Land acquisition loans are secured by a first lien on the property and are generally limited to 65% &#32;of the acquisition price or the appraised value, whichever is less. Development land loans are generally limited to 75% &#32;of the discounted appraised value based on the projected lot sale absorption rate and associated carry and liquidation costs of the developed lots and homes. Underwriting criteria for acquisition and development loans include, but are not limited to, evidence of preliminary plat approval, compliance with state and Federal environmental protection and disclosure laws, engineering plans, detailed cost breakdowns and marketing plans. These loans have been limited to projects within the North Olympic Peninsula and Puget Sound region. Other risk management tools include, but are not limited to, title insurance, feasibility and market absorption reports, environmental questionnaires, and other supplementary information as may be required to determine if the project and proposed lots represent acceptable collateral for timely repayment of the loan. 

The success of land acquisition, development and construction lending is largely dependent upon successful completion of the project and future sales or leasing of the property for repayment of the loan. Because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates related to construction costs, the market value of the completed project, the demand for the property at completion, the rates of interest paid, and other factors that may affect the ability to complete the project or affect the value of the completed project, actual results may vary significantly from those estimated and can have a significant adverse impact on the value and marketability of the collateral for these types of loans. 

At June 30, 2016 , the average construction commitment for single family residential construction was $387,000, for multi-family construction was $6.2 million and for commercial real estate construction was $2.0 

million. The largest construction commitments for multi-family and commercial real estate were $10.0 million and $11.1 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016 . 

Substantially all of our land acquisition, development and construction lending have adjustable rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed monthly, as is the case for acquisition and development loans. When original interest reserves set up at origination are exhausted, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and it is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate. 

In the event of default on an incomplete construction project, and because properties under construction are difficult to sell, we may advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder in order to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, at which time we may or may not fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. 

We also originate individual lot loans, which are secured by a first lien on the property, for borrowers who are planning to build on the lot within the next five &#32;years. Generally, these loans have a maximum loan to value ratio of 75% &#32;for improved lands (legal access, water and power) and 50% &#32;to 65% &#32;for unimproved land. The interest rate on these loans is fixed with a 20 -year amortization and a five -year term. At June 30, 2016 , individual lot loans totaled $17.5 million &#32;or 2.8% &#32;of the total loan portfolio.

Our construction and land loans are geographically disbursed throughout the state of Washington and, as a result, these loans are susceptible to risks that may be different depending on the location of the project. We manage all of our construction lending by utilizing a licensed third party vendor to assist us in monitoring our construction projects with construction loan proceeds disbursed periodically as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved third party vendor warrant.

Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, new and used automobile loans, loans on other miscellaneous vehicles including recreational vehicles, travel trailers and motorcycles, and personal lines of credit. At June 30, 2016 , home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $33.9 million , or 5.4% &#32;of the loan portfolio. Our interest rates on home equity loans are risk priced adjusted based on credit score, loan to value and overall credit quality of the applicant. Home equity loans are made for, among other purposes, the improvement of residential properties and other consumer needs. Some of these loans are secured by first liens; however, the majority of these loans are secured by a second deed of trust on the residential property. Fixed-rate, fully-amortizing home equity loans in first lien position are available up to a maximum loan amount of $750,000 with repayment periods ranging from five to 20 years. We also offer a home equity line of credit product, which has a five &#32;year, interest-only term with the remaining balance at the end of the term amortized over a period of 15 years, up to a maximum of $250,000 &#32;if in first lien position. Home equity fixed and line of credit products in second lien positions have a maximum loan amount of $75,000. Home equity lines of credit are tied to the prime rate during the interest-only period. &#32;&#32; Home equity loans and lines of credit have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because they are secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property, which we may or may not have private mortgage insurance coverage. 

We offer several options for vehicle purchase or refinance with a maximum term of up to 84 &#32;months depending on the age and condition of the vehicle. Loan rates for auto lending, as well as all other consumer loans, are priced based on the specific loan type and the risk involved. Direct and indirect lending sources are used to originate auto loans, which includes online as well as in person applications at our branch locations. 

We currently make indirect auto loans by partnering with auto dealerships throughout our market areas using a third party service provider that facilitates the underwriting and origination of these loans based on our underwriting and pricing criteria. We contracted directly with local auto dealerships prior to the implementation of the current program. At June 30, 2016 , auto loans totaled $5.3 million, of which $2.2 million &#32;were originated through one of our local dealer programs. We have also used an Internet-based origination service that was terminated in 2015, and at June 30, 2016, we had $202,000 &#32;and $366,000 &#32;of auto loans to borrowers located outside and inside the state of Washington, respectively, that were originated through this service. 

Consumer loans represent additional and unique underwriting risks because of the mobility and rapidly depreciating nature of consumer assets such as automobiles, RVs, boats and trailers in contrast to real estate based collateral. If a borrower defaults, repossession and liquidation of the collateral may not provide sufficient sales proceeds to satisfy the outstanding loan balance. Many factors account for potential loan losses on consumer loans, a number of which are largely outside the control of the lender and include deferred maintenance, damages, depreciation and borrowers who relocate to other states. While subsequent legal actions and judgments against defaulted borrowers may be appropriate, such collection efforts and costs may not always be warranted and are evaluated after determining the cost of such collection efforts and the probability of any future loan recovery. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. 

Commercial Business Lending. As of June 30, 2016 , commercial business loans totaled $16.9 million , or 2.7% , of our loan portfolio. These loans are primarily originated as loans to business borrowers, which include lines of credit, term loans, and letters of credit. These loans are typically secured by business assets and are used for general business purposes, including seasonal and permanent working capital, equipment financing, capital, and general investments. In general, loan terms vary from one &#32;to seven &#32;years with floating rates indexed to LIBOR, The Wall Street Journal &#32;prime rate or other acceptable indices depending on prevailing economic and market conditions. A typical requirement for us to extend business credit is for the borrower to have a business deposit relationship with us which, in most cases, includes multiple accounts and related services from which we realize low cost deposits plus service and ancillary fee income. 

Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small-to-medium sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market area. Our commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower&#8217;s background, capacity to repay the loans and the adequacy of the borrower&#8217;s capital, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower&#8217;s past, present and future cash flows, as well as the collateral pledged as security is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans. 

Primary repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable due to normal business cycles, industry changes, and economic and political conditions. Furthermore, collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value based on market conditions or other factors. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrowing entity and secondarily on the underlying collateral and revenue provided by the borrower and guarantors. Most often, this collateral consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Secondary sources of repayment and/or recovery for most of these loans are based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral, and may include enforcement of personal guaranties. Secondary underwriting and collection efforts may include accounts receivable, or other third party payments, whereby availability of funds for repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower or a third party to collect amounts due from its customers. In addition, collateral secured by business assets may become functionally or economically obsolete, which can become problematic from a valuation, collection and liquidation perspective. 

Loan Solicitation and Processing. &#32;&#32;Our loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including existing or walk-in customers, business development by our relationship managers (&#8220;RMs&#8221;), and referrals from our directors, business owners, investors, entrepreneurs, builders, realtors, existing customers and other professional third parties, including brokers. Loan originations are further supported by lending services offered through our Internet website, direct mail, advertising, cross-selling, employees&#8217; community service and in the case of auto loans, by partnering with auto dealerships throughout our market areas using a third party service provider. &#32; All of our consumer loan products, including residential mortgage loans and secured and unsecured consumer loans are processed through our centralized processing and underwriting center. Commercial business loans, including commercial and multi-family real estate loans, are processed by the RMs, RM assistants, and credit underwriters with formalized credit presentations submitted to our senior loan committee, and/or management possessing the appropriate lending authority, for approval. &#32; The senior loan committee consists of the president/chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief credit officer, chief banking officer, director of lending, commercial credit administrator, and mortgage and consumer credit manager. Exceptions to our loan policies are fully disclosed to the approving authority, either the individual or senior loan committee, prior to commitment. Exceptions are reported to the board of directors monthly. During the years ended June 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , there were eight &#32;exceptions and twenty-seven &#32;exceptions, respectively. 

Lending Authority. &#32;Under our current policy, our board of directors has delegated loan approval authority as follows: Overdrafts may be approved by our chief credit officer up to $250,000 and select named positions up to $25,000. The chief credit officer along with an underwriter or the mortgage and consumer credit manager can approve mortgage loans up to $500,000 . Mortgage loans in amounts over $500,000 &#32;up to $2.9 million &#32;require the approval of the senior loan committee. At June 30, 2016, any loan or relationship in excess of $5.0 million required the approval of the board loan asset/quality committee. The lending limit requiring board loan approval was increased to $6.0 million with a corresponding lending authority change of up to $5.9 million from $4.9 million for the senior loan committee. 

Commercial loan approvals require two or more signatures from Credit Administration, Production Administration, and/or Executive Administration personnel. The chief credit officer and the commercial credit administrator are authorized individually to approve commercial loan relationships up to $1.0 million and $500,000, respectively. The chief banking officer or director of lending are authorized individually to approve commercial loan s &#32;relationships up to $500,000, and the chief executive officer or chief financial officer are authorized individually to approve commercial loans up to $250,000. Approval is required from two of the three levels, regardless of the loan relationship amount, and their approval authorities can be aggregated not to exceed $1.8 million. The approval of any commercial loan relationship in excess of the aggregate approval authority and up to $5.9 million requires the approval of the two officers stated above with further approval required from the Bank's senior loan committee. Commercial loan relationships of $6.0 million or more require approval by the senior loan committee and then the majority of the board loan committee. In certain circumstances, the chief credit officer, individually, or the commercial credit administrator and the chief banking officer together, may approve Automated Clearing House and Remote Deposit Capture transactions up to any amount. In addition, where there is an existing relationship with a commercial borrower with loans outstanding in excess of $6.0 million, the board loan committee has authorized the senior loan committee to approve additional commercial loans to this borrower in excess of $6.0 million, so long as the total amount of these additional loans does not exceed $750,000. 

The board loan/asset quality committee and full board continue to provide direction through policy approval and oversight for key credit risk management, such as lending to percentage of capital, loans to one borrower limits, and underwriting criteria. The board loan committee reviews all loan approvals by the senior loan 

committee each quarter. The board of directors will also review the approvals of the board loan/asset quality committee. The board loan/asset quality committee will also review all policy exceptions, concentrations of credit and compliance with all lending policies. The board loan/asset quality committee meets at least quarterly to discuss asset quality, loan production, and policy compliance, as well as to review industry trends. 

Washington law provides that Washington chartered savings banks, such as First Federal, are subject to the same loans to one borrower restrictions as Washington chartered commercial banks, which restricts total loans and extensions of credit by a bank to 20% &#32;of its unimpaired capital and surplus. As a result, under Washington law, First Federal would be limited to loans to one &#32;borrower of $28.0 million &#32;at June 30, 2016 . As of July 26, 2016, First Federal elected to restrict its loans to one &#32;borrower to no more than 18% &#32;of its unimpaired capital plus surplus or $18.0 million , whichever is less, unless specifically approved by the board loan/asset quality committee as an exception to policy. At June 30, 2016 , 18% of First Federal&#8217;s unimpaired capital was $22.6 million , and under this policy, loans to one &#32;borrower would have been $18.0 million . The following table provides a summary of our five largest relationships at June 30, 2016 .

Multi-family Real Estate 

Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases and Sales. &#32;&#32;We originate mortgage, consumer, multi-family and commercial real estate, and commercial business loans for our portfolio utilizing fixed- and adjustable-rate loan products. We also purchase whole and participation loans on a servicing retained or released basis, including loans that may be located outside our primary market areas. Our ability to originate sufficient loan volume to meet our asset and liability management objectives is limited within our historical market as a result of consumer demand, population demographics, and economic conditions. We, like many other financial institutions, may experience significant prepayments on loans due to prevailing economic conditions and low interest rates. In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate real estate loans is substantially reduced, which results in a decrease in interest income. During the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , our total originations were $217.0 million , $105.0 million &#32;and $113.3 million , respectively. 

The North Olympic Peninsula region, which represents a substantial concentration of depositors and borrowers, has experienced limited population growth, and the region's unemployment rate is higher than both the state and national unemployment rates. As a result, we originate and purchase loans outside of these areas in the counties surrounding the Puget Sound and elsewhere, and we may purchase loans with different credit and underwriting criteria than those we originate organically. 

During the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;we purchased $59.2 million , $26.1 million &#32;and $39.9 million &#32;of loans, respectively. Loan pools purchased in the past three years consisted primarily of loans exceeding conforming loan limits, or "jumbo loans," secured by single family residential properties located in Washington and California. We have also participated with other lenders on commercial real estate loans located in Washington. Purchased loans, loan pools, and participations are underwritten by our credit administration department, evaluated for credit risk, and approved by the appropriate loan committee(s) prior to purchase, according to our lending authority guidelines. For more information see Item 1.A. Risk Factors -&#8220;Slower growth in our primary market area has led us to originate and purchase loans outside of our market area which could affect the level of our nonperforming loans.&#8221; 

We actively sell residential first mortgage loans in the secondary market, and we currently service all loans sold but have, in the past, also sold loans with the servicing released. The majority of all residential mortgages we originate are fixed-rate mortgages, which we may sell to the secondary market at the time of origination to improve our interest rate risk or selectively add to our loan portfolio in an effort to enhance our net interest income. During the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we sold $7.8 million , $22.5 million &#32;and $28.8 million &#32;of residential mortgage loans, respectively. Our secondary market relationship is primarily with Freddie Mac, and we receive a servicing fee on loans sold when the servicing is retained by us. Loans in general are sold on a non-recourse basis, whenever possible, subject to a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant. Sales 

of real estate loans through secondary market conduits can be beneficial to us since these sales generate income at the time of sale, produce future servicing income, provide funds for additional lending, and assist us in managing our interest rate risk. Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of one- to four-family loans and participations are recognized at the time of the sale. Our net gain on sales of residential loans was $234,000 , $548,000 &#32;and $762,000 &#32;for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

At June 30, 2016 , we were servicing $187.7 million &#32;of residential mortgage loans for Freddie Mac and other secondary market purchasers. We earned mortgage servicing income of $502,000 , $561,000 , and $606,000 &#32;for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and mortgage servicing rights for these loans had a fair value at June 30, 2016 , of $1.7 million . See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 

During fiscal 2008, we sold loans with &#8220;life of the loan&#8221; recourse provisions to Freddie Mac, requiring us to repurchase the loan if it defaults. Additionally, beginning in May 2013, Freddie Mac has required loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture to be sold with "life of the loan" recourse provisions. The balance of loans serviced for others with life of the loan recourse provisions was $7.2 million &#32;at June 30, 2016 . Two &#32;loans were repurchased during the year ended June 30, 2016 &#32;for $151,000 , two &#32;loans were repurchased during the year ended June 30, 2015 &#32;for $335,000 &#32;and one &#32;loan was repurchased during the year ended June 30, 2014 &#32;for $239,000 .

Loan Origination and Other Fees. &#32;&#32;Loan origination fees generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan that is paid by the borrower. Accounting standards require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized as income at the time of prepayment. We had $1.2 million , $840,000 &#32;and $862,000 &#32;of net deferred loan fees at June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. In addition, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and miscellaneous services. 

Asset Quality 

Management of asset quality is accomplished by internal controls, monitoring and reporting of key risk indicators, and both internal and independent third party loan reviews. The primary objective of our loan review process is to measure borrower performance and assess risk for the purpose of identifying loan weakness in order to minimize loan loss exposure. From the time of loan origination through final repayment, all loans are assigned a 

risk rating based on pre-determined criteria and levels of risk. The risk rating is monitored annually for most loans, and may change during the life of the loan as appropriate. 

Internal and independent third party loan reviews vary by loan type, as well as the nature and complexity of the loan. Some loans may warrant detailed individual review, while other loans may have less risk based upon size, or be of a homogeneous nature reducing the need for detailed individual analysis. Assets with these characteristics, such as consumer loans and loans secured by residential real estate, may be reviewed on the basis of risk indicators such as delinquency or credit rating. In cases of significant concern, a total re-evaluation of the loan and associated risks are documented by completing a loan risk assessment and action plan. Some loans may be re-evaluated in terms of their fair market value or net realizable value in order to determine the likelihood of potential loss exposure and, consequently, the adequacy of specific and general loan loss reserves. 

We generally assess late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of five percent of the monthly payment amount due. Substantially all first lien residential fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loan payments are due on the first day of the month with a 15-day grace period following the due date, after which time we institute collection procedures including a mailed first notice of delinquency and late charge and efforts to contact the borrower by telephone. Attempts to contact the borrower to establish a cause of the default and assess the borrower's willingness and ability to repay the debt continue until the 90th day, after which time if we have not been able to reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default with the borrower, we will pursue all permissible remedies according to the terms of the security instruments and applicable law. In the event of an unsecured loan, we will either seek legal action against the borrower or refer the loan to an outside collection agency.

For the years ended June 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , gross interest income which would have been recorded had the nonaccruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $306,000 &#32;and $184,000 , respectively. The amount that was included in interest income on a cash basis on nonaccruing loans was $75,000 , $178,000 &#32;and $167,000 &#32;for the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

Other Loans of Concern. &#32;In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of June 30, 2016 &#32;there were 47 &#32;accruing loans totaling $4.1 million &#32;with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the nonperforming asset categories. These loans have been considered in management's determination of our allowance for loan losses. 

Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Property. &#32;&#32;Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure, deed in lieu, or non-merger deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. When the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of its cost, which is the unpaid principal balance of the related loan, or the fair market value of the property less selling costs. Other repossessed collateral, including automobiles, are also recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value. As of June 30, 2016 , First Federal had one &#32;property in real estate owned with a book value of $22,000 &#32;and one &#32;personal property owned with a book value of $59,000 . Our real estate owned property is located in Washington State, listed with a real estate broker for sale, included in the multiple listing service, and actively being marketed. 

Restructured Loans. According to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as a TDR. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if we, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower under more favorable terms and conditions than we would grant to an ordinary bank customer under a normal course of business standard. 

General loan restructures and modifications not considered as TDR loans may include lowering interest rates, extending the maturity date, deferring or re-amortizing monthly payments or other concessions. These general loan restructures and modifications are made on a case-by-case basis provided that such concessions are not below market rates nor considered material and outside of the terms and conditions granted to other borrowers under normal course of business standards. 

Adversely classified loans which are subsequently modified and placed in nonaccrual status must remain in nonaccrual status for a period of not less than six months with consecutive satisfactory payment performance and be further supported by current financial information and analysis which demonstrates the borrowers have the financial capacity to meet future debt service before being returned to accrual status. 

As of June 30, 2016 , we had 52 &#32;loans with an aggregate principal balance of $6.5 million &#32;which we have identified as TDR loans, &#32; of which $5.6 million &#32;were performing in accordance with their revised payment terms and on accrual status. As of June 30, 2016 , there were $944,000 &#32;of TDR loans on nonaccrual and whose accrual status continues to be evaluated by management. Included in the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016 &#32;was a reserve of $267,000 &#32;related to TDR loans. Nonaccruing TDR loans are classified as substandard, and accruing TDR loans may be classified special mention or pass in our loan grading system depending upon verified repayment sources, collateral values and repayment history. 

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard when material conditions are identified which raise issues about the financial capacity, collateral or other conditions which may compromise the borrower&#8217;s promise and ability to satisfactorily perform under the terms of the loan. Substandard assets considered impaired include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as impaired with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make near term collection or liquidation highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets with the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are classified by us as either watch or special mention assets. 

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310 and ASC 450, when we classify problem assets as substandard, doubtful, and loss, we may conduct individual loan and collateral analysis to establish a specific loan loss allowance in an amount we deem prudent, based on the unique circumstances of each loan. Our Credit Administration and certain other members of senior management review the analysis and approve the specific loan loss allowance for these loans. 

General reserve loan loss allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances on impaired loans, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution identifies a problem asset as an unavoidable and imminent loss, it is required to partially or fully charge-off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the DFI and the FDIC, who can order specific charge-offs or the establishment of additional loan loss allowances. 

We review, at least quarterly, the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require reclassification. On the basis of our review, as of June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had classified loans of $4.6 million , $9.9 million , and $13.9 million , respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2016 &#32;we had $2.8 million &#32;of special mention loans. At June 30, 2016 , classified assets represented 2.4% &#32;of equity capital and 0.5% &#32;of assets. The decrease in classified assets during the year ended June 30, 2016 &#32;was mainly attributable to the borrowers' improved financial condition as well as their ability to sell the underlying collateral securing these loans and repay our loan with the sales proceeds. 

The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated.

Allowance for Loan Losses. &#32;&#32;Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Monthly, our chief credit officer prepares a report of the allowance for loan losses and establishes the provision for credit losses based on the risk composition of our loan portfolio, delinquency levels, loss experience, economic conditions, regulatory examination results, seasoning of the loan portfolios, and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. This allowance for loan losses report is reviewed monthly by our Asset Quality Committee consisting of the chief credit officer, chief banking officer, chief financial officer and chief executive officer. The qualitative factors, which have an impact on the allowance for loan losses, are approved by Management on a quarterly basis. Quarterly, the allowance for loan losses with the adjusted qualitative factors is reviewed by the board of director's board loan/asset quality committee and presented for approval to the full board of directors. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, which is charged against current period operating results, and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. 

We believe the quantitative and qualitative analysis necessary to calculate accounting estimates for loan loss reserves is a critical process; however, we also recognize that economic, market, industry and political changes can adversely affect loan quality. Unpredictable personal events or other undisclosed information by individual borrowers can occur at any time, which can result in immediate significant changes in, as well as management&#8217;s assumptions about, probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of such events can quickly deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which could negatively affect current and future earnings. 

Our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The formula for the general loan loss reserve allowance is determined by applying an estimated quantified loss percentage, as well as qualitative factors, to various groups of loans. The loss percentages are generally based on various historical measures such as the amount and type of classified loans, past due ratios, loss experience, and economic conditions, which could affect the collectability of the respective loan types. Qualitative factors and adjustments to the loan loss reserve calculations are largely subjective but also include objective variables such as unemployment rates, falling or rising real estate values, real estate and retail sales, demographics and other known material economic indicators. A specific allowance is established when management believes the borrower&#8217;s financial and/or collateral condition has materially deteriorated to a point of impairment and loss is highly probable. 

The allowance for loan losses was $7.2 million , or 1.2% &#32;of total loans, at June 30, 2016 , compared to $7.1 million , or 1.4% &#32;of total loans, and $8.1 million , or 1.6% &#32;of total loans, at June 30, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Fluctuations in the allowance for loan losses are the result of changes in asset quality reflected in our delinquent, nonperforming, and classified loans and amount of loan charge-offs, together with our recognition of qualitative factors and changes in the balance and mix of loans in the portfolio. &#32; First Federal uses a three year loss history as part of its allowance for loan losses methodology, and management continually monitors local, regional, and national economic trends. 

We define a loan as being impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are grouped together for impairment analysis and reserve calculation. All other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors which include payment history, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance. As of June 30, 2016 , we had impaired loans of $9.1 million , compared to $10.8 million &#32;and $14.7 million &#32;at June 30, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

In determining the allowance for loan losses, management utilizes the valuation shown in the most recent appraisal obtained, unless additional information is known, which can result in additional adjustments to the valuation of collateral pledged. Appraisals or evaluations may be updated subsequent to the time of origination, whenever management identifies a loan as impaired or potentially being impaired. Events which may trigger an 

updated appraisal or evaluation include, but are not limited to, borrower delinquency, material technical defaults, annual review of borrower&#8217;s financial condition, property tax and/or assessment delinquency, deferred maintenance or other information known or discovered by us. 

Impaired collateral dependent loans require a current appraisal and analysis to determine the net value of the collateral for loan loss reserve purposes. Our policy is to update these appraisals every 12 months as long as the loan and collateral remains impaired, except for smaller balance, homogeneous loans, which are applied a reserve according to their risk weighting and loan class. Certain types of collateral, depending on market conditions, may require more frequent appraisals, updates or evaluations. When the results of the impairment analysis indicate a potential loss, the loan is classified as substandard and a specific reserve amount is established or adjusted to reflect any further deterioration in the value of the collateral that may occur prior to liquidation or reinstatement. The impairment analysis takes into consideration the primary, secondary, and tertiary sources of repayment, whether impairment is likely to be temporary in nature or liquidation is anticipated. 

Management believes that our allowance for loan losses as of June 30, 2016 , was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provision that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 

The following table summarizes the distribution of our allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated.

Investment Activities 

General. &#32;Under Washington law, savings banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker&#8217;s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt, and obligations of states and their political subdivisions. 

Our chief financial officer has the basic responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio, in consultation with our chief executive officer, and the direction and guidance of the board of directors. Various factors are considered when making investment decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds from deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. 

The general objective of our investment portfolio is to provide sufficient liquidity to fund lending when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 

Securities. &#32;Total investment securities decreased $36.7 million , or 10.2% , to $323.9 million &#32;at June 30, 2016 , from $360.6 million &#32;at June 30, 2015 , as we continued to use cash flows from sales, calls, and normal amortization and prepayment activity of investment securities to fund loan growth. At June 30, 2016 , U.S. government agency issued mortgage-backed securities ("MBS agency") still comprised the largest portion of our investment portfolio at 56.4% , followed by corporate issued mortgage-backed securities ("MBS corporate") at 12.7% , municipal bonds at 11.6% , corporate issued asset-backed securities ("ABS corporate") at 9.1% , U.S. Treasury and government agency issued bonds ("Agency bonds") at 4.6% , U.S. Small Business Administration securities ("SBA") at 3.1% , and U.S. government agency issued asset-backed securities ("ABS agency") at 2.4% . MBS agency securities also comprised the largest change in the investment portfolio, decreasing $39.6 million &#32;during the year, followed by decreases in SBA securities of $25.2 million , Agency bonds of $8.7 million , ABS agency of $1.3 million , and ABS corporate of $253,000 , partially offset by an increase in municipal bonds of $5.2 million . The estimated average life of the total investment securities portfolio was 4.2 years &#32;at June 30, 2016 &#32;and 4.7 years &#32;at June 30, 2015 . 

The issuers of MBS agency securities held in our portfolio, which include Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, and certain issuers of agency bonds held in our portfolio, which include the U.S. Treasury, FHLB, and Fannie Mae, as well as the U.S. Small Business Administration, guarantee the timely principal and interest payments in the event of default. ABS agency bonds held in our portfolio also include securities issued by Sallie Mae Student Loan Trust and CIT Education Loan Trust, which are backed by student loans in a subordinate tranche where payment is not guaranteed by the issuer. The underlying student loans are reinsured by the U.S. Department of Education, which mitigates a significant portion of their risk of loss. Municipal bonds consist of a mix of taxable and non-taxable, revenue and general obligation bonds issued by various local and state government entities that use their revenue-generating and taxing authority as a source of repayment of their debt. The state of the issuers of our municipal bonds, in which we hold more than 10% of our municipal bond portfolio at June 30, 2016, include Washington state at 23.5%, New York at 21.6%, Florida at 12.1%, and Michigan at 11.1%. Our municipal bonds are considered investment grade, and we monitor their credit quality on an ongoing basis. 

ABS and MBS corporate securities have no guarantees in the event of default and therefore warrant continued monitoring for credit quality. Our MBS corporate securities consist of fixed and variable rate mortgages issued by various corporations, and our ABS corporate securities consist of a mix of variable rate collateralized loan obligations in managed funds which we believe have sufficient subordination to mitigate the risk of loss on these investments. Monitoring of these securities may include, but is not limited to, reviewing credit quality standards such as delinquency, subordination, and credit ratings. Our corporate securities are considered investment grade. 

As a member of the FHLB, we had an average balance of $4.6 million &#32;in stock of the FHLB for the year ended June 30, 2016 . We received $104,000 , $12,000 , and $10,000 &#32;in dividends from the FHLB during the years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

The table below sets forth information regarding the composition of our securities portfolio and other investments at the dates indicated. At June 30, 2016 , our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States Government or its agencies.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

General. &#32;&#32;Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk. 

Our deposit composition reflects a mixture with certificates of deposit accounting for 22.0% &#32;of the total deposits at June 30, 2016 , and interest and noninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts comprising the balance of total deposits. We rely on marketing activities, convenience, customer service and the availability of a broad range of deposit products and services to attract and retain customer deposits. We did not have any brokered deposits at June 30, 2016 . 

Deposits . Deposits are attracted from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structure and deposit mix, our customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative sources. 

Deposit Activity. The following table sets forth our total deposit activities for the periods indicated.

The Federal Reserve requires First Federal to maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of June 30, 2016 , our deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and vault cash exceeded our reserve requirements. 

Borrowings. Although customer deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities, we have used advances from the FHLB, including short-term overnight advances and longer term advances, to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements, and to provide longer-term funding to better match the duration of selected loan and investment maturities. 

Depending upon the retail banking activity and the availability of excess post-conversion capital that may be provided to us, we will consider and may undertake additional leverage strategies within applicable regulatory requirements or restrictions. These borrowings would be expected to primarily consist of FHLB advances. 

As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. Government) provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a committed credit facility with the FHLB and at June 30, 2016 &#32;had pledged loan and security collateral to support a borrowing capacity of $214.1 million . At that date outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $80.7 million &#32;leaving a remaining borrowing capacity of $133.4 million . 

The following tables set forth information regarding our borrowings at the end of and during the periods indicated. The tables include both long- and short-term borrowings.

Subsidiary and Other Activities 

First Federal had one &#32;wholly-owned subsidiary, North Olympic Peninsula Services, Inc. (&#8220;NOPS&#8221;), which had been inactive for approximately ten years prior to its dissolution by First Federal during the fiscal year 2016. In 2008, First Federal partnered with Craft3, Inc., a Washington nonprofit corporation, to form two limited liability companies for the purpose of participating in the new markets tax credit program (&#8220;NMTC&#8221;). The Craft3 partnership was also dissolved in fiscal 2016 after the expiration of our participation in the NMTC program in June 2015. 

&#160; 

Competition 

We face competition in originating loans. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, and mortgage bankers. Other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending, including our indirect lending. Commercial business competition is primarily from commercial banks, some of which have a nationwide presence. We compete by delivering high-quality, personal service to our customers that result in a high level of customer satisfaction. 

We attract our deposits through our branch office system. Competition for those deposits is principally from other savings institutions, commercial banks and credit unions located in the same community, as well as mutual funds and other alternative investments. We compete for these deposits by offering excellent service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. 

Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money center and regional banks. These include large national lenders that have greater resources and may offer services that we do not provide. 

Employees 

At June 30, 2016 , we had 178 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. We consider our employee relations to be good.

HOW WE ARE REGULATED 

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal. The descriptions of laws and regulations included herein do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Washington State Legislature that may affect the operations of First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and the CFPB. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which was enacted in July 2010, imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and their holding companies. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. First Federal is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, we are generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or rule-making by the federal banking agencies, and their impact on operations cannot yet fully be assessed. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for First Northwest Bancorp, First Federal and the financial services industry more generally. 

Regulation of First Federal 

General. &#32;&#32;First Federal, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and to regulations and examinations of the DFI. As an insured institution, it also is subject to examination and regulation by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of First Federal to the maximum permitted by law. During these state or federal regulatory examinations, the examiners may require First Federal to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, which can impact our capital and earnings. This regulation of First Federal is intended for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the FDIC and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders of First Federal or First Northwest Bancorp. First Federal is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to First Northwest Bancorp. See "&#8211; Capital Requirements" and "&#8211; Dividends." 

Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions . As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered savings banks, the DFI may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a cease-and-desist 

order against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations or compliance status of a savings bank. 

Regulation by the Washington Department of Financial Institutions . State law and regulations govern First Federal's ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices. As a state savings bank, First Federal must pay semi-annual assessments, examination costs and certain other charges to the DFI. 

Washington law generally provides the same powers for Washington savings banks as federally and other-state chartered savings institutions and banks with branches in Washington, subject to the approval of the DFI. Washington law allows Washington savings banks to charge the maximum interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit to Washington residents which are allowable for a national bank in another state if higher than Washington limits. In addition, the DFI may approve applications by Washington savings banks to engage in an otherwise unauthorized activity if the DFI determines that the activity is closely related to banking and First Federal is otherwise qualified under the statute. This additional authority, however, is subject to review and approval by the FDIC if the activity is not permissible for national banks. 

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC . The deposit insurance fund of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in First Federal up to $250,000 &#32;per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended June 30, 2016 , were $424,000 . 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution&#8217;s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments, whereby stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are based on an institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity with an assessment rate schedule ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Federal. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 

Prompt Corrective Action. &#32;&#32;Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution&#8217;s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 10% &#32;or more, its ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets is 6% &#32;or more, its ratio of common equity capital is 5% or more, its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets (leverage ratio) is 5% &#32;or more, and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level. In order to be adequately capitalized, an institution must have a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 8% , a core capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of not less than 4% , and a leverage ratio of not less than 4% . An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 

Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by First Federal to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if not remedied, result in restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or 

conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. At June 30, 2016 , First Federal was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory capital requirements described below. For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;The minimum capital level requirements applicable to First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. 

There is a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above these regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in, which began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. A financial institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 

To be considered "well capitalized," First Northwest Bancorp must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to maintain a specific capital level. To be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; First Federal must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. 

As of June 30, 2016, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions. For additional information regarding First Northwest Bancorp&#8217;s and First Federal&#8217;s required and actual capital levels at June 30, 2016, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution&#8217;s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management believes that, under the current regulations, First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness. &#32;&#32;The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution&#8217;s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#32;First Federal is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. As a member, First Federal is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At June 30, 2016 , First Federal held $4.4 million &#32;in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central 

bank for its members within its assigned region, and it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each FHLB makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by its Board of Directors, subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB, and all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At June 30, 2016 , First Federal had $80.7 million &#32;of outstanding advances from the FHLB of Des Moines. See Item 1, "Business &#8211; Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds &#8211; Borrowings." 

The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of First Federal's FHLB of Des Moines stock may result in a corresponding reduction in its capital. 

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. &#32;&#32;Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership, the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance coverage or bankers&#8217; blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. 

Dividends. &#32;Dividends from First Federal constitute a major source of funds for dividends in future periods that may be paid by First Northwest Bancorp to shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by First Federal to First Northwest Bancorp depends upon First Federal&#8217;s earnings and capital position; is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies; and is subject to prior regulatory approval. According to Washington law, First Federal may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. Dividends on First Federal&#8217;s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of First Federal without the approval of the Director of the DFI. 

The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by First Federal&#8217;s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 

Affiliate Transactions. &#32;&#32;Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Transactions deemed to be a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% &#32;of the bank subsidiary&#8217;s capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% &#32;of the bank subsidiary&#8217;s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. 

Community Reinvestment Act. &#32;&#32;First Federal is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank&#8217;s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low-and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of a bank&#8217;s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank&#8217;s CRA performance rating must be considered in connection with a bank&#8217;s application, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits; to relocate an existing office; or to merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. First Federal received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating during its most recent CRA examination. 

Privacy Standards. &#32; &#32;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLBA) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among 

commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. First Federal is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require First Federal to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of its rights to opt out of certain practices. 

Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. &#32;The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress asked to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including First Federal, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 

Federal Reserve System. &#32;The Federal Reserve Board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or noninterest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of June 30, 2016 , First Federal's deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements. 

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. &#32;The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. First Federal is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, First Federal is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 

First Federal is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject First Federal to various penalties including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

Regulation and Supervision of First Northwest Bancorp 

General. First Northwest Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve and the sole shareholder of First Federal. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that First Northwest Bancorp limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of First Federal. 

As a bank holding company, First Northwest Bancorp is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders 

and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, First Northwest Bancorp is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provides that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by being prepared to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations, or both. 

Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 

Acquisitions. &#32;The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% &#32;of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designed as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% &#32;of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications under the BHCA. These guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with $1.0 billion &#32;or more in assets, or with fewer assets but certain risky activities, and on a bank-only basis to other companies. These bank holding company capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed on First Federal by the FDIC. For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion &#32;in total consolidated assets, the capital guidelines typically apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. For additional information, see the section above entitled &#8220;- Regulation of First Federal - Capital Regulation&#8221; and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8., "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 

Interstate Banking . The Federal Reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than the holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The Federal Reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state. Nor may the Federal Reserve approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% &#32;of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% &#32;or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% &#32;state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law. 

The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997, which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions 

involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. 

Restrictions on Dividends. &#32;&#32;First Northwest Bancorp's ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the Federal Reserve limits and Washington law, and it may depend on its ability to receive dividends from First Federal. 

A policy of the Federal Reserve limits the payment of a cash dividend by a bank holding company if the holding company's net income for the past year is not sufficient to cover both the cash dividend and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. A bank holding company that does not meet any applicable capital standard would not be able to pay any cash dividends under this policy. A bank holding company not subject to consolidated capital requirements is expected not to pay dividends unless its debt-to-equity ratio is less than 1:1 , and it meets certain additional criteria. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. 

Except for a company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, a bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10.0% &#32;or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation or regulatory order, condition, or written agreement. A bank holding company is considered well-capitalized if on a consolidated basis it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% &#32;and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% &#32;or more, and is not subject to an agreement, order, or directive to maintain a specific level for any capital measure. 

Any material deviations from, or changes to, the business plan provided as part of the conversion and stock offering are subject to the prior written approval of the Regional Director of the FDIC-San Francisco. Under Washington corporate law, First Northwest Bancorp generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities . 

Stock Repurchases. &#32; Any repurchases of our common stock during the three year period following the conversion is subject to the prior approval of the DFI and other bank regulatory agencies, as applicable. A bank holding company, except for certain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and highly rated bank holding companies, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 

The Dodd-Frank Act. &#32;The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and implemented new capital regulations that First Northwest Bancorp has become subject to and that are discussed above under &#8220;- Regulation of First Federal - Capital Regulations.&#8221; In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like First Northwest Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time. 

Federal Securities Law. The stock of First Northwest Bancorp is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, First Northwest Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

First Northwest Bancorp stock held by persons who are affiliates of First Northwest Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If First Northwest Bancorp meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of First Northwest Bancorp will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 

The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to First Northwest Bancorp as a registered company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of these Sarbanes-Oxley requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley-related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. 

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General. &#32;&#32;First Northwest Bancorp and First Federal are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to First Northwest Bancorp or First Federal. First Federal is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before June 30, 2013 . See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Form 10-K. 

First Northwest Bancorp anticipates that it will file a consolidated federal income tax return with First Federal commencing with the first taxable year after completion of the conversion. Accordingly, it is anticipated that any cash distributions made by First Northwest Bancorp to its shareholders would be considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non&#8209;taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. 

Method of Accounting. &#32;&#32;For federal income tax purposes, First Federal currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on June 30 for filing its federal income tax return. 

Minimum Tax. &#32;The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% &#32;on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% &#32;of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. First Federal has been subject to the alternative minimum tax, and at June 30, 2016 &#32;has credits for carryover of approximately $14,475 . 

Corporate Dividends&#8209;Received Deduction . &#32;&#32;First Northwest Bancorp may eliminate from its income dividends received from First Federal as a wholly owned subsidiary of First Northwest Bancorp if it elects to file a consolidated return with First Federal. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100% , or 80% , in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payor of the dividend. Corporations which own less than 20% &#32;of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% &#32;of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 

Charitable Contribution Carryovers. &#32;&#32;The Company may carryforward charitable contributions to the succeeding five taxable years. The utilization of the charitable contribution carryforward may not exceed 10% &#32;of taxable income as defined by the federal taxation laws. At June 30, 2016 , the Company had a charitable 

contribution carryforward for federal income tax purposes of $8.8 million . This carryforward was generated from the Company&#8217;s creation of the First Federal Community Foundation to which it contributed 933,360 shares of its common stock and $400,000 in cash in connection with the mutual to stock conversion. Management does not fully expect to utilize the benefit over the five year carryforward period and has recorded a reserve on the portion of the related deferred tax asset estimated to expire unused. 

Washington Taxation 

First Federal is subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.5% of gross receipts. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax.
