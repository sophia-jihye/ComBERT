 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are an emerging bionutrition and biotherapeutics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of products that improve muscle health and function essential to the management of sarcopenia, cachexia and degenerative muscle diseases, and as an adjunct to the treatment of obesity. As used in this report, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;MYOS&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, or &#8220;we&#8221; refers to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2007. On March 17, 2016, we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary and changed our name from MYOS Corporation to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. Prior to February 2011, we did not have any operations and did not generate revenues. In February 2011, we entered into an intellectual property purchase agreement pursuant to which our subsidiary purchased from Peak Wellness, Inc., or Peak, the intellectual property pertaining to Fortetropin &#174; , a dietary supplement that has been shown in clinical studies to temporarily decrease the levels of serum myostatin, MYO-T12, a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin, certain trademarks, trade secrets, patent applications and certain domain names. 

&#160; 

Since February 2011, our principal business activities have been to: (i) deepen our scientific understanding of the activity of Fortetropin, which refers to a proprietary proteo-lipid composite derived from fertilized eggs of specific chicken species processed using a patented methodology which preserves the bioactivity of the constituent proteins and lipids, specifically as a natural, reversible, temporary reducing agent of myostatin, and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen and build our intellectual property; (ii) conduct research and development activities to evaluate myostatin modulation in a range of both wellness and disease states; (iii) identify other products and technologies which may broaden our portfolio and define a business development strategy to protect, enhance and accelerate the growth of our products; (iv) reduce the cost of manufacturing through process improvement; (v) identify contract manufacturing resources that can fully meet our future growth requirements; (vi) develop a differentiated and advantaged consumer positioning, brand name and iconography; and, (vii) create sales and marketing capabilities to maximize near-term and future revenues. We believe that existing wellness and therapeutic targets, such as myostatin, represent a rational entry point for additional drug discovery efforts and are evaluating a separate, concurrent objective in this area. 

&#160; 

Our executive offices are currently located at 45 Horsehill Road, Suite 106, Cedar Knolls, New Jersey 07927 and our telephone number is (973) 509-0444. Our website address is http://www.myosrens.com. Neither the information on our current or future website is, and such information shall not be deemed to be, a part of this report or incorporated in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

&#160; 

Strategic Investment Transaction 

&#160; 

On December 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with RENS Technology Inc. (the &#8220;Purchaser&#8221;), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to invest $20.25 million in the Company in three tranches over twenty-four months (the &#8220;Financing&#8221;). Concurrent with the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with RENS Agriculture Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (&#8220;RENS Agriculture&#8221;), the parent company of the Purchaser, pursuant to which the Company will supply product for RENS Agriculture&#8217;s exclusive distribution in China (including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and all countries in Southeast Asia. In addition, the Purchaser agreed that, subsequent to the closing of the first tranche of the Financing, it will assist the Company in: utilizing its food technologies in the Company&#8217;s existing and future products, finding suitable manufacturing partners in China, locating suitable acquisition targets in China and setting up a subsidiary in China. In the first tranche of the Financing, which closed on March 3, 2016, the Purchaser acquired 1,500,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and a warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at an exercise price of $7.00 per share for $5.25 million.

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Following our purchase of Fortetropin in February 2011, we have been focusing on the discovery, development, and commercialization of nutritional supplements, functional foods, therapeutic products, and other technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. Our officers, directors and members of our Scientific Advisory Board, including Dr. Robert Hariri, Dr. Louis Aronne, Dr. Neilank Jha and Dr. Caroline Apovian, have significant research and development experience. While Fortetropin is our first proprietary ingredient, we plan to discover, develop, formulate and/or acquire additional products in the future. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We are developing nutritional and therapeutic products aimed at maintaining and improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. One current target of research which we are actively evaluating is the modulation of myostatin. Our research is focused on developing strategies and therapeutic interventions to address muscle related conditions including sarcopenia, cachexia, and inherited and acquired muscle diseases as described in more detail below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Sarcopenia is a degenerative process characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass with advancing age. The loss of muscle affects all individuals regardless of ethnicity or gender although the rate and degree of muscle loss varies between individuals and is affected by many factors. Those individuals who have lost significant amounts of muscle mass and strength often require assistance for accomplishing daily living activities, which has a significant economic burden on a nation&#8217;s healthcare system and impacts the overall economy. In addition to the many direct costs, sarcopenia adversely affects the overall quality of life. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in many diseases such as cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney failure and AIDS. It is characterized by a loss of body weight as a consequence of pathological changes in different metabolic pathways, with the loss of muscle mass as the core component of the syndrome. Cachexia leads to a poor quality of life and increased mortality. As skeletal muscle is diminished, individuals experience a reduced ability to move, a loss of strength, and an increase in conditions associated with immobility such as thrombosis, pneumonia, respiratory failure and ultimately death. Weight loss is an important prognosticator in cancer therapy with the greater the weight loss the shorter the survival time. Weight loss in cancer patients due to cachexia arises from the loss of both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Inherited and acquired muscle diseases , such as muscular dystrophy and muscle dysfunction that occur as a consequence of denervation such as seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are conditions marked by the progressive deterioration of muscle tissue that results in weakness and impairs normal function. These diseases are typified by difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination with many such diseases affecting speech, swallowing, and breathing. There are currently no cures for degenerative muscle diseases outside of palliative care. &#160; 

Myostatin 

&#160; 

Myostatin, which is a natural regulatory protein, plays a central role in skeletal muscle health. Interest in myostatin continues to grow within the medical community. Research on animals and humans with genetic deficiency for producing myostatin have shown an increased muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin is responsible for down-regulating muscle growth and development. In addition, myostatin increases with age, inhibiting muscle growth and contributing to muscle atrophy in the elderly. 

&#160; 

A 1997 article in the journal Nature first described the discovery of a novel member of the transforming growth factor-undefined (TGF-undefined) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors. This factor was expressed specifically in adult skeletal muscle and referred to as growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8) (McPherron et al ., 1997). The researchers created &#8220;knockout&#8221; mice, whereby they disrupted the expression of GDF-8 throughout the organism, with the resulting mice showing a large and widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass. Individual muscles of mutant animals weighted 2-3 times more than those of wild-type animals, with the increase a result of both muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The newly created mice were subsequently named &#8220;mighty mice&#8221;. Based on the phenotype, the researchers dubbed the newly discovered protein myostatin. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

This work suggests myostatin exerts an effect on both muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, as myostatin knock-out &#8220;mighty mice&#8221; were shown to have an increase in both the number of muscle fibers and in fiber sizes. Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of a tissue or organ due to the enlargement of its component cells. In contrast, hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells or a proliferation of cells. Both of these processes can lead to enlargement of an organ. 

&#160; 

Skeletal muscle is the primary producer of myostatin, where it is secreted into the blood stream and acts as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation and growth. The protein begins as a 375 amino acid dimer that is cleaved by proteases to a 109 amino acid active domain. The active form of the protein binds to activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB (Lee et al ., 2001). Binding to the receptors initiates a signaling cascade that results in an increase in protein breakdown and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis. 

&#160; 

Clinical Research to Evaluate Effects of Fortetropin 

&#160; 

In March 2013, we completed a human clinical trial which confirmed the beneficial effects of Fortetropin in suppressing free serum myostatin levels. In this double blind, randomized placebo controlled, parallel, single dose study involving 12 healthy adult male subjects per arm, test subjects in the active arm were administered a 6.6 gram dose of Fortetropin mixed with vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding. An equal amount of vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding alone was given to the placebo arm. Blood samples were collected at baseline (before dosing) and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post dose intervals for measurement of myostatin blood concentration. Results demonstrated greater than 30% decrease in serum myostatin levels compared to baseline during the 24 hour period. No study related adverse events were reported during this study. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In another study at the University of Tampa, a double-blind, placebo controlled trial examined the effects of Fortetropin on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained individuals who rely heavily on satellite cell activation. Forty-five subjects were then divided into placebo, 6.6 gram and 19.8 gram dosing arms of Fortetropin daily for a period of 12 weeks. All exercise sessions were conducted and monitored by trained personnel. Standardized diets consisted of roughly 54% carbohydrates, 22% fat and 24% protein. There were no differences in total calories and macronutrients between groups. Dual emission X-ray absorptiometry was utilized to measure lean body mass and fat mass. Direct ultrasound measurements determined muscle thickness of the quadriceps. 

&#160; 

Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin compared to a placebo. Strength and power endpoints, as measured by bench press, leg press and Wingate power, significantly increased from baseline in all study groups. Another important finding was a statistically significant decrease in fat mass in subjects in the 19.8 gram arm. This finding, which has potentially broad implications for metabolism and weight management, bears further investigation and studies are currently being planned. No study related adverse events were reported during the study.

Association between Muscular Strength and Mortality 

&#160; 

In a clinical study at the Karolinska Institutet&#8217;s Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Unit for Preventive Nutrition, in Huddinge, Sweden, 8,762 men aged 20-80 were evaluated over an average period of 18.9 years in a prospective cohort study to measure the association between muscular strength and mortality in men. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, the study found that muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with deaths from all causes and cancer in men. The findings were valid for men of normal weight, those who were overweight, and younger or older men, and were valid even after adjusting for several potential confounders, including cardiorespiratory fitness. This study extends previous studies that showed the importance of muscular strength as a predictor of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in a large cohort of men. Several prospective studies have also shown that muscular strength is inversely associated with all-cause mortality. These data suggests that muscular strength adds to the protective effect of cardiorespiratory fitness against the risk of death in men. Moreover, it might be possible to reduce all-cause mortality among men by promoting regular resistance training. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe improving lean muscle mass should be a therapeutic objective in the management of aging and chronic illness and all individuals seeking optimal wellness. Fortetropin, the only clinically proven natural myostatin reducing agent available to increase muscle mass and lean body mass, provides us with a compelling product in the competitive marketplace. Further studies are planned to examine its role in the treatment of many disease states in various dosing regimens and delivery mechanisms. 

&#160; 

WADA Compliance 

&#160; 

Fortetropin&#174; has received Certified Drug Free&#174; certification from the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG). The BSCG Certified Drug Free&#174; program is a comprehensive certification program for the dietary supplement industry and includes screening for substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) along with most U.S. professional sports leagues. WADA is a foundation created through a collective initiative led by the International Olympic Committee to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports. 

&#160;

We expect our investment in research and development to continue to grow in the future. 

&#160; 

Our research program is actively evaluating the many active proteins, lipids and peptides in Fortetropin. We believe our research programs will establish a basis for the continued submission of patent applications to help protect our intellectual property. We are dedicated to protecting our innovative technology. 

&#160; 

Clinical and Basic Research Programs 

&#160; 

We invest in research and development activities externally through academic and industry collaborations aimed at enhancing our products, optimizing manufacturing and broadening the product portfolio. We have developed the following collaborations with various academic centers: 

&#160; 

&#9679; In May 2015, we initiated a dose response clinical study led by Jacob Wilson, Ph.D., CSCS*D, Professor of Health Sciences and Human performance at the University of Tampa, to examine the effects of Fortetropin supplementation on plasma myostatin levels at various dosing levels in young adult males and females. This study is intended to help us better define the dose response curve, the minimal effective dose and effects of Fortetropin on serum myostatin. In this double blind placebo controlled clinical study, 80 male and female subjects ranging in ages between 18 and 22 were randomized into four groups such that no significant differences in serum myostatin concentration existed between groups. Following assignment to one of the four groups, blood samples were collected to establish baseline values. Subjects were subsequently supplemented with three different doses of Fortetropin (2.0g, 4.0g and 6.6g) and a matching placebo for one week. Following a week of supplementation, blood samples were collected and serum myostatin levels were assayed. Results demonstrated that Fortetropin is effective as a myostatin reducing agent at daily doses of 4.0g and 6.6g. This research, which continues to build upon our current knowledge of Fortetropin, may result in the formulation of new products. An abstract of this study has been accepted for presentation at the 2016 International Conference on Frailty &#38; Sarcopenia Research, to be held in April 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; In August 2014, we entered into a research agreement with Human Metabolome Technologies America, Inc., (&#8220;HMT&#8221;), to apply their proprietary, state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technologies to characterize the metabolomic profiles of plasma samples obtained from healthy male subjects who used either Fortetropin or placebo with the goal of identifying metabolites with pro-myogenic activity in the plasma samples of subjects who took Fortetropin as well as examining the effect on glucose and fat metabolism. HMT used a metabolite database of over 290 lipids and over 900 metabolites to identify potential plasma biomarkers of muscle growth. The study was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014. Initial data from this study indicated that subjects who received Fortetropin displayed differential metabolomic profiles relative to subjects who received placebo. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of Fortetropin and provides guidance for the development of biotherapeutics based on Fortetropin. Additionally, the early indications of plasma biomarkers may guide future study design for Fortetropin clinical trials by identifying clinically-relevant endpoints and potential stratification of patient populations. &#160; 

&#9679; In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with the University of Tampa to study the effects of Fortetropin supplementation in conjunction with modest resistance training in average men. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which examined the effects of Fortetropin on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained males. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6g and 19.8g dosing arms of Fortetropin daily for a period of 12 weeks. Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin compared to placebo. Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in fat mass in subjects in the 19.8g arm was noted. The clinical study also analyzed blood myostatin, follistatin and cytokines levels via high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (&#8220;ELISA&#8221;) based spectrophotometric. Serum was analyzed for a plethora of relative cytokine levels via high-sensitivity enhanced chemiluminescent-based methods. The Interferon-Gamma (&#8220;IFN-undefined&#8221;) inflammatory cytokine protocol screening showed no statistically significant changes in serum levels of IFN-undefined for subjects in the placebo group. However, subjects in both Fortetropin daily dosing arms experienced statistically significant decreases (p &#60; 0.05) in serum levels of the IFN-undefined inflammatory cytokine. IFN-undefined is recognized as a signature pro-inflammatory cytokine protein that plays a central role in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Excess levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with muscle-wasting diseases such as sarcopenia and cachexia. The lipid serum safety protocol demonstrated that daily use of Fortetropin at recommended and three times the recommended dose had no adverse lipid effect and did not adversely affect cholesterol, HDL or triglyceride levels. Data from the study was presented at the American College of Nutrition&#8217;s 55 th annual conference. A separate mechanism of action study at the University of Tampa demonstrated that in addition to reducing serum myostatin levels, Fortetropin showed activity in mTOR and Ubiquitin pathways, two other crucial signaling pathways in the growth and maintenance of healthy muscle. Specifically, the preclinical data showed that Fortetropin up-regulates the mTOR regulatory pathway. The mTOR pathway is responsible for production of a protein kinase related to cell growth and proliferation that increases skeletal muscle mass. Up-regulation of the mTOR pathway is important in preventing muscle atrophy. We believe Fortetropin's ability to affect the mTOR pathway may have a significant impact in treating patients suffering from degenerative muscle diseases and suggests that Fortetropin-based products may help slow muscle loss secondary to immobility and denervation. The preclinical data also demonstrated that Fortetropin acts to reduce the synthesis of proteins in the Ubiquitin pathway, a highly selective, tightly regulated system that serves to activate muscle breakdown. Over-production in the Ubiquitin pathway is responsible for muscle degradation. We believe Fortetropin's ability to regulate production in the Ubiquitin pathway may have significant implications for repairing age-related muscle loss and for patients suffering from chronic diseases causing cachexia. &#160; 

&#9679; In May 2014, we entered into a three-year master service agreement with Rutgers University. The initial phase under the agreement was to develop cell-based assays for high-throughput screening studies of next generation myostatin inhibitors. Additionally, we initiated a second phase of the agreement to develop a secondary assay for measuring myostatin activity using a genetically engineered muscle cell line that fluoresce in the presence of myostatin. Phase I and II were completed in 2015. We believe the assays developed will enable us to elucidate the specific molecules in Fortetropin that impart activity as it relates to the development of muscle tissue. &#160; 

&#9679; In September 2013, we entered into a clinical study agreement with Hackensack University Medical Center to conduct a clinical study to determine the effects of Fortetropin on blood chemistries and body mass index in healthy adult women. Enrollment in this study is ongoing. &#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The foregoing agreements are an integral part of our business strategy and we believe they will provide a clear scientific rationale for Fortetropin's role as a nutritional product and support its use in different medical and health applications in the future. 

&#160; 

We are also building a small molecule and biologics discovery program aimed at regulators of myostatin synthesis and activation and the different pathways that act upon muscle development. In July 2014, we entered into a research and development agreement with Cloud Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (&#8220;Cloud&#8221;), to discover product candidates related to the inhibition of targets in the myostatin regulatory pathway as well as inflammatory mediators associated with sarcopenia and cachexia. Cloud utilizes cloud computing technology to initiate and design small molecule drug candidates based on their Inverse Design proprietary cheminformatics tool. The research is focusing on the development of product candidates related to the myostatin pathway. Cloud has identified several peptides that may have myostatin inhibition properties. We intend to evaluate the physiological activity of these peptides on myostatin. 

&#160; 

We intend to pursue additional clinical studies and medical research to support differentiated and advantaged marketing claims, to build and enhance our competitive insulation via strategically based additional intellectual property, to develop product improvements and new products in consumer preferred dosage forms, to enhance overall marketing, to establish a scientific foundation for therapeutic applications for our technology, and to pursue best in class personnel. 

&#160; 

Market Overview 

&#160; 

According to the Natural Marketing Institute, the Dietary Supplement, Functional Food and Beverage, and Natural Personal Care markets represent more than $250 billion in annual worldwide sales. The global market for functional foods alone in 2013 was worth an estimated $43.3 billion. In 2017, it is expected to grow to $54 billion, and the United States is expected to be the fastest growing market for functional foods. The global sports nutrition market was valued at $24.7 billion in 2014, and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.3% during the period 2015 to 2020. We believe our proprietary ingredient, Fortetropin, which is the only clinically proven natural supplement available in the market that temporarily reduces free serum myostatin level, is well-positioned to market to a wide base of consumers looking for nutritional and performance maximization as well as for wellness and maintenance products as they age. Additionally, the medical community has increased its focus on muscle health, specifically focusing on the aging U.S. population that can benefit most from myostatin modulation. We believe persons suffering from sarcopenia, a muscle loss condition due to aging, and cachexia, a syndrome characterized by loss of body weight in many diseases such as cancer, may also benefit from Fortetropin as muscle loss can be slowed by a reduction of myostatin in the body. 

&#160; 

We believe the combination of the foregoing marketplace characteristics, combined with the experience of our directors and our management team and our current and future products, will enable our business model to succeed. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to understand the complex genetic and molecular pathways regulating muscle mass and function as well as other disease mechanisms. Understanding the impact of complex regulatory pathways which act to build and maintain healthy lean muscle is central to our biotherapeutic research. This research is the foundation of our bionutritional product development. We are developing nutritional products that target specific mechanisms to promote health in ways that cannot be met by other treatments, diets or lifestyle changes. 

&#160; 

We will seek to gain market share for our core branded products in functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehab and restorative health verticals by (i) formulating and developing new and complementary product lines, (ii) expanding U.S. distribution by increasing the channels of sale, (iii) expanding distribution geography beyond the U.S., including China and Southeast Asia and (iv) seeking strategic relationships with other distributors. Our strategy is to utilize the revenue and awareness generated by the sales and marketing of Fortetropin to further advance our research and development of nutritional and therapeutic treatments for muscular-related conditions, including sarcopenia. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our commercial focus is to leverage our clinical data to develop multiple products to target the large, but currently underserved, markets focused on muscle health. The sales channels through which we sell our products are evolving. The first product we introduced was MYO-T12, which was sold in the sports nutrition market. MYO T-12 is a proprietary formula containing Fortetropin and other ingredients. The formula was sold under the brand name MYO T-12 and later as MYO-X through an exclusive distribution agreement with Maximum Human Performance (&#8220;MHP&#8221;). While the exclusive distribution agreement with MHP terminated in March 2015, MHP continues to distribute its remaining MYO-X inventories on popular retailer websites and in specialty retailers principally in the U.S. Sales to MHP for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $57 thousand. We expect minimal future sales to MHP, if any.

&#160; 

In February 2014, we expanded our commercial operations into the age management market through a distribution agreement with Cenegenics Product and Lab Services, LLC (&#8220;Cenegenics&#8221;), under which Cenegenics distributes and promotes a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin through its age management centers and its community of physicians focused on treating a growing population of patients focused on proactively addressing age-related health and wellness concerns. On November 28, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with Cenegenics wherein we agreed to accept $1.9 million by April 2016, (i.e., $300 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $100 thousand per month from January 2015 through April 2016) in full satisfaction of Cenegenics outstanding obligations with respect to units of product produced by the Company, including units that had not yet been shipped to Cenegenics at the time of the settlement agreement. In exchange, we agreed to withdraw our October 10, 2014 request for arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce. During the second quarter of 2015, Cenegenics accepted delivery of the remaining units that we were storing on its behalf. Given the settlement agreement&#8217;s extended payment schedule, the Company deferred the revenue and related cost associated with the shipment and will record the revenue and cost of sales when the related payments are received, which is expected to be in early 2016. The distribution agreement with Cenegenics expires in December 2016. We are unable to predict the amount of future orders from Cenegenics under the distribution agreement, if any. 

&#160; 

During the second quarter of 2015 we launched R&#275; Muscle Health TM , our own direct-to-consumer portfolio of muscle health bars, meal replacement shakes and daily supplement powders each powered by a full 6.6 gram single serving dose of Fortetropin. Our R&#275; Muscle Health products are sold through our e-commerce website, remusclehealth.com, and amazon.com. 

&#160; 

We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to the Company, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products. We expect to continue developing our own core branded products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehab and restorative health and to pursue international sales opportunities. We expect to leverage our relationship with RENS Agriculture to pursue distribution opportunities in countries in Southeast Asia where we believe there may be significant demand for our products. The growing awareness of the potential therapeutic uses of myostatin reducing agents supports continued development of our own core products. We remain committed to continuing our focus on various clinical trials in support of our marketing claims as well as to enhance our intellectual property, to develop product improvements and new products, and to reduce the cost of our products by finding more efficient manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property strategy, the implementation of which is ongoing. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring our current commercial products and processes, and those currently under development, are being protected to the maximum extent possible. We are in the process of filing multiple patent applications in the United States and abroad, and we are currently prosecuting pending patent applications in the United States, all of which are directed towards our compositions and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition to a proactive protection strategy, we are conducting defensive diligence to ensure our products and processes do not encroach upon the rights of third parties. Moreover, we are also engaged in a survey of the intellectual property owned by potential competitors, and are devising a proactive path to stay ahead of such potential competitors. 

&#160; 

In August 2014, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, issued U.S. Patent No. 8,815,320 B2 to us covering our proprietary methods of manufacturing Fortetropin. The patent entitled &#8220;Process for Producing a Composition Containing Active Follistatin,&#8221; provides intellectual property protection for making Fortetropin, the key ingredient in our core commercial muscle health products, and carries a patent term through early 2033. Additionally, we are currently prosecuting a core patent application covering the basic science on which our business was built, which application is currently undergoing examination at the USPTO, and has a priority date of May 18, 2006. The scope of this application covers the various applications of avian follistatin products and the benefits thereof. In particular, this application is focused on the composition currently in our commercially sold Fortetropin-powered products and the known benefits thereof. We intend to file as many applications as possible as continuation/divisional/continuation-in-part applications. Several additional pending patent applications that we are pursuing include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Genetically modified microorganisms - covering the utilization of yeast, algae or other microorganisms to grow desired proteins/molecules to create our core line of products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Method of obtaining effective amounts of avian follistatin - covering a method of controlling the amount of avian follistatin and the concentrations thereof within a product by extracting the proteins from various parts of fertilized and unfertilized avian eggs. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Methods of treating degenerative muscle disease &#8211; covering methods of treating various degenerative muscle diseases, such as sarcopenia, with avian egg-based products and the compositions thereof. &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Methods and products for increasing muscle mass &#8211; covering various combinations of proteins, lipids and other molecules, which are active in the natural form of our core commercial products, which may be combined in advantageous amounts to yield improved products and methods for increasing muscle mass. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Egg-based product having hydroxymethylbutyrate, or HMB, for the treatment of degenerative muscle disease &#8211; covering a line of products combining avian egg-based products with HMB for improved treatment of degenerative muscle diseases and the methods of treating the same. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Egg-based product having leucine for treatment of degenerative muscle disease - covering a line of products combining avian egg-based products with leucine for improved treatment of degenerative muscle diseases and the methods of treating the same. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Methods of treatment of degenerative muscle disease using egg-based products and testosterone replacement therapy &#8211; covering methods of treating degenerative muscle disease in combination with testosterone replacement therapy for improved results. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Methods of treatment of cancer using avian egg powder. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Methods of treatment of insulin resistance and Type II diabetes using avian egg powder. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Methods of treatment of neurological diseases using avian egg powder. 

&#160; 

In addition to patent protection, we are also engaged in protecting our brands, including corporate brands and product brands, and have sought trademark registrations in the United States for the same. We are in the process of implementing a clearance strategy for new brands we intend to launch, to ensure any risk of encroaching on the rights of third parties is minimized. 

&#160; 

We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our key trademarks is crucial to our business strategy of building strong brand name recognition. These trademarks are crucial elements of our business, and have significant value in the marketing of our products. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used correctly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to attempt to cancel a trademark if priority is claimed or there is confusion of usage. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights generally are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to stop the unauthorized use of the trademark by third parties in the United States. Much of our ongoing work, including our research and development, is kept highly confidential. As such, we are in the process of adopting corporate confidentiality policies that comply with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act to protect some of our most valuable intellectual property assets. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Environment 

&#160; 

The importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling and advertising of our current and future products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has primary jurisdiction over our products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDCA provides the regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements, foods and medical foods. In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. In addition, the Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, or APHIS, regulates the importation of our primary product from Germany. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction of product advertising. 

&#160; 

The term &#8220;medical foods&#8221; does not pertain to all foods fed to sick patients. Medical foods are prescription foods specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. They were defined in the FDA&#8217;s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments and are subject to the general food safety and labeling requirements of the FDCA but are exempt from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. Medical foods are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use and from traditional foods that bear a health claim. In order to be considered a medical food, a product must, at a minimum, be a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring food in its natural state) for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube), be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements and be intended to be used under medical supervision.

&#160; 

Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations is a critical part of our business. We endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. However, as with any regulated industry, the laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and there can be no assurances that a government agency would necessarily agree with our interpretation of the governing laws and regulations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These regulations could, however, require the reformulation of our products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products not able to be reformulated. The risk of a product recall exists within the industry although we endeavor to minimize the risk of recalls by distributing products that are not adulterated or misbranded. However, the decision to initiate a recall is often made for business reasons in order to avoid confrontation with the FDA. 

&#160; 

Our products are required to be prepared in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, for dietary supplements. Fortetropin, the active ingredient in our products, must be imported into the United States in conformance with APHIS&#8217;s requirements for egg products. Other statutory obligations include reporting all serious adverse events on a Medwatch Form 3500A. To date, we have not filed a Medwatch Form 3500A with the FDA nor have we been placed on notice regarding any serious adverse events related to any of our products. Since eggs are considered a major food allergen under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, we are required to label all our products containing Fortetropin to note that they contain egg product. 

&#160; 

Advertising of dietary supplement products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTCA provides that the dissemination of any false advertising pertaining to foods, including dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under the FTC's substantiation doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made. All advertising is required to be truthful and not misleading. All testimonials are required to be typical of the results the consumer may expect when using the product as directed. Accordingly, we are required to have adequate substantiation of all material advertising claims made for our products. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. 

&#160; 

In March 2009, the General Accounting Office, or GAO, issued a report that made four recommendations to enhance the FDA&#8217;s oversight of dietary supplements. The GAO recommended that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of the FDA to: (i) request authority to require dietary supplement companies to identify themselves as a dietary supplement company and update this information annually, provide a list of all dietary supplement products they sell and a copy of the labels and update this information annually, and report all adverse events related to dietary supplements, not just serious adverse events; (ii) issue guidance to clarify when an ingredient is considered a new dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to document the safety of new dietary ingredients, and appropriate methods for establishing ingredient identity; (iii) provide guidance to industry to clarify when products should be marketed as either dietary supplements or conventional foods formulated with added dietary ingredients; and (iv) coordinate with stakeholder groups involved in consumer outreach to identify additional mechanisms for educating consumers about the safety, efficacy, and labeling of dietary supplements, implement these mechanisms, and assess their effectiveness. These recommendations could lead to increased regulation by the FDA or future legislation concerning dietary supplements. 

&#160; 

In addition, medical foods must comply with all applicable requirements for the manufacture of foods, including food Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), registration of food facility requirements and, if applicable, FDA regulations for low acid canned food and emergency permit controls. The FDA considers the statutory definition of medical foods to narrowly constrain the types of products that fit within this category of food. The FDA inspects medical food manufacturers annually to assure the safety and integrity of the products. Failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable requirements could lead to sanctions that could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing; Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

We are committed to producing and selling highly efficacious products that are trusted for their quality and safety. To date, our products have been outsourced to third party manufacturers where the products are manufactured in full compliance with cGMP standards set by the FDA. All of the raw materials for our current products are currently sourced from third-party suppliers. Any shortages in our raw materials could result in materially higher raw material prices and adversely affect our ability to source our product. Since the beginning of 2012, we have been focusing on the efficiency and economics of manufacturing Fortetropin. Our management has examined the production cost and is working to achieve cost savings in production. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We currently have one third-party manufacturer of Fortetropin. We have multiple vendors for blending, packaging and labeling our products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Given the large patient populations that could potentially benefit from treatments targeted at myostatin, a number of pharmaceutical companies are currently developing various types of myostatin inhibitors. Eli Lilly and Co., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sanofi S.A., Scholar Rock and Acceleron Pharma Inc, are among the companies that we are aware of that are testing new compounds in the field of myostatin inhibition. The market for nutritional supplements is highly competitive. Companies operating in the space include PepsiCo Inc., Glanbia Plc. GNC Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Laboratories, Nestle S.A. and Universal Nutrition. Competition is based on price, quality, customer service, marketing and product effectiveness. Our competition includes numerous nutritional supplement companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies compete with us in the nutritional supplement market. These companies and certain nutritional supplement companies have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than us and have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Other companies are able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. Private label products of our competitors, which in recent years have significantly increased in certain nutrition categories, compete directly with our products. In several product categories, private label items are the market share leaders. Increased competition from such companies, including private label pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Many companies within our industry are privately-held and therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors with respect to sales. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain commercial liability, including product liability coverage, and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability of $5.0 million per occurrence, and $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our legal liability, tenant&#8217;s improvements, business property, and inventory. We maintain product liability insurance with an aggregate cap on retained loss of $10.0 million. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have eight full-time employees (including two executive officers). We also employ several consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
