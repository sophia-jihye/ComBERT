 Item 1. Business. 

General 

German American Bancorp, Inc., is a NASDAQ-traded (symbol: GABC) bank holding company based in Jasper, Indiana. On March 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of River Valley Bancorp ("River Valley"), and its subsidiaries, including River Valley Financial Bank. The acquisition is discussed in more detail in Note 20 (Subsequent Events) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. After the acquisition of River Valley, German American, through its banking subsidiary German American Bancorp, operates 51 banking offices in 19 contiguous southern Indiana counties and one northern Kentucky county. The Company also owns an investment brokerage subsidiary (German American Investment Services, Inc.) and a full line property and casualty insurance agency (German American Insurance, Inc.). 

Throughout this Report, when we use the term &#8220;Company&#8221;, we will usually be referring to the business and affairs (financial and otherwise) of German American Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole. Occasionally, we will refer to the term &#8220;parent company&#8221; or &#8220;holding company&#8221; when we mean to refer to only German American Bancorp, Inc. and the term &#8220;Bank&#8221; when we mean to refer only to the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiary. 

The Company&#8217;s lines of business include retail and commercial banking, comprehensive financial planning, full service brokerage and trust administration, and a full range of personal and corporate insurance products. Financial and other information by segment is included in Note 15 (Segment Information) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report and is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s revenues are derived from customers located in, and substantially all of its assets are located in, the United States.

Business Developments 

On March 1, 2016, the Company acquired by merger River Valley Bancorp and its subsidiary, River Valley Financial Bank. River Valley Financial Bank, headquartered in Madison, Indiana, provided a full range of commercial and consumer banking services from 14 banking offices predominantly located in southeast Indiana. At the time of acquisition, River Valley reported on its balance sheet consolidated assets and equity (unaudited) as of February 29, 2016 that totaled $516.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively. For further information regarding the River Valley merger transaction, see Note 20 (Subsequent Events) in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, which Note 20 is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. 

The Company expects to continue to evaluate opportunities to expand its business through opening of new banking, insurance or trust, brokerage and financial planning offices, and through acquisitions of other banks, bank branches, portfolios of loans or other assets, and other financial-service-related businesses and assets in the future.

Competition 

The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. The Bank competes for commercial and retail banking business within its core banking segment not only with financial institutions that have offices in the same counties but also with financial institutions that compete from other locations in Southern Indiana and elsewhere. Further, the Bank competes for loans and deposits not only with commercial banks but also with savings and loan associations, savings banks, credit unions, production credit associations, federal land banks, finance companies, credit card companies, personal loan companies, investment brokerage firms, insurance agencies, insurance companies, lease finance companies, money market funds, mortgage companies, and other non-depository financial intermediaries. There are numerous alternative providers (including national providers that advertise extensively and provide their services via e-mail, direct mail, telephone and the Internet) for the insurance products and services offered by German American Insurance, Inc., trust and financial planning services offered by the Bank and the brokerage products and financial planning services offered by German American Investment Services, Inc. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Company. 

Employees 

At March 1, 2016 the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 596 full-time equivalent employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements, and employee relations are considered to be good. 

Regulation and Supervision 

Overview 

The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is required to file with the FRB annual reports and such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB may also make examinations or inspections of the Company. The Bank is under the supervision of and subject to examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;DFI&#8221;), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Regulation and examination by banking regulatory agencies are primarily for the benefit of depositors rather than shareholders. 

Under FRB policy and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a complex and wide-ranging statute that was enacted by Congress and signed into law during July 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank, and to commit resources to support the Bank, even in circumstances where the Company might not do so absent such a requirement. Under current federal law, the FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. It may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the FRB believes might jeopardize the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. 

With certain exceptions, the BHC Act prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in (or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in) nonbanking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities deemed by the FRB to be &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; Under current regulations, bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are permitted to engage in such banking-related business ventures as consumer finance; equipment leasing; credit life insurance; computer service bureau and software operations; mortgage banking; and securities brokerage. 

Under the BHC Act, certain well-managed and well-capitalized bank holding companies may elect to be treated as a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; and, as a result, be permitted to engage in a broader range of activities that are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; and in activities that are determined to be incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. These activities include underwriting and dealing in and making a market in securities (subject to certain limits and compliance procedures required by the so-called Volcker Rule provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act, described below under &#8220;Other Aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;); insurance underwriting, and merchant banking. Banks may also engage through financial subsidiaries in certain of the activities permitted for financial holding companies, subject to certain conditions. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company and its subsidiary bank has not elected to form financial subsidiaries. 

The Bank and the subsidiaries of the Bank may generally engage in activities that are permissible activities for state chartered banks under Indiana banking law, without regard to the limitations that might apply to such activities under the BHC Act if the Company were to engage directly in such activities at the parent company level or through parent company subsidiaries that were not also bank subsidiaries. 

Indiana law and the BHC Act restrict certain types of expansion by the Company and its bank subsidiary. The Company and its subsidiaries may be required to apply for prior approval from (or give prior notice and an opportunity for review to) the FRB, the DFI, the FDIC, and/or other bank regulatory or other regulatory agencies, as a condition to the acquisition or establishment of new offices, or the acquisition (by merger or consolidation, purchase or otherwise) of the stock, business or properties of other banks or other companies. 

The earnings of commercial banks and their holding companies are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open-market operations in U.S. Government securities, varying the discount rate on bank borrowings, and setting reserve requirements against bank deposits. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and affect interest rates charged on loans and earned on investments or paid for time and savings deposits. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and this is expected to continue in the future. The general effect, if any, of such policies upon the future business and earnings of the Company cannot accurately be predicted. 

Capital Requirements 

We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the parent company and at the Bank level administered by the FRB and by the FDIC and DFI, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action&#8221; (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors. We have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well-capitalized standards. 

Generally, for purposes of satisfying these capital requirements, we must maintain capital sufficient to meet both risk-based asset ratio tests and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into various weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. A risk-based ratio represents the applicable measure of capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is a measure of our core capital divided by our total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. 

Effective January 1, 2015 (subject to certain phase-in provisions), we became subject to new rules adopted in 2013 by the federal banking agencies that implement certain regulatory capital reforms based upon banking supervision principles adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;) and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Generally, under these new rules (and subject to certain phase-in provisions), (a) minimum requirements have increased for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations, (b) new and stricter criteria are applied for determining the eligibility for inclusion in regulatory capital of capital instruments (other than common equity), and (c) the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets has changed. The rules include, among other requirements: 

&#8226; 

a new minimum ratio of &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital&#8221; to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% 

&#8226; 

a new conservation buffer of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to (when fully phased in) an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (raised from 4% under the prior guidelines to 6%) plus (when fully phased in) the conservation buffer of an additional 2.5%, resulting in a minimum required total Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Total Capital (that is, Tier 1 Capital plus instruments includable in a tier called Tier 2 Capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus (when fully phased in) the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% Total Capital ratio as that buffer is phased-in, effectively resulting in a minimum Total Capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) 

&#8226; 

a minimum leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets) 

The new capital measure &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) Capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the new rules, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) and common equity Tier 1 minority interest. 

Tier 1 Capital under the new rules consists of CET1 (subject to certain adjustments) and &#8220;additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, plus, in the case of smaller holding companies like ours, trust preferred securities in accordance with prior requirements for their inclusion in Tier I Capital. 

Under prior capital standards in effect throughout 2014, the effects of AOCI items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios; under the present rules, we and our bank subsidiary were given the opportunity to make a one-time election (the &#8220;Opt-out Election&#8221;) to filter certain AOCI components, comparable to their treatment under the prior risk-based capital rules. Our AOCI Opt-out Election was made in connection with the regulatory financial reports that we and our bank subsidiary filed with banking agencies for our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015. 

Although banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will technically comply with minimum capital requirements under the new rules, such institutions will face limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

As applied to us, these rules generally became effective January 1, 2015; the new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital conservation buffer, however, will be phased in from 2016 through 2019. 

Prompt Corrective Action Classifications 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act (enacted in 1991) (FDICIA) requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take regulatory enforcement actions known as Prompt Corrective Action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized. 

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not well-capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. Since the Bank throughout 2015 was well-capitalized, the FDICIA brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $19.1 million of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2015. Further, a depository institution or its holding company that is not well-capitalized will generally not be successful in seeking regulatory approvals that may be necessary in connection with any plan or agreement to expand its business, such as through the acquisition (by merger or consolidation, purchase or otherwise) of the stock, business or properties of other banks or other companies. 

Under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations, the applicable agency can treat an institution as if it were in the next lower category if the agency determines (after notice and an opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The degree of regulatory scrutiny of a financial institution will increase, and the permissible activities of the institution will decrease, as it moves downward through the capital categories. Institutions that fall into one of the three undercapitalized categories may be required to (i) submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) raise additional capital; (iii) restrict their growth, deposit interest rates, and other activities; (iv) improve their management; (v) eliminate management fees and dividends; or (vi) divest themselves of all or a part of their operations. Bank holding companies can be called upon to boost the capital of the financial institutions that they control, and to partially guarantee the institutions&#8217; performance under their capital restoration plans. Critically under-capitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified. 

The minimum ratios defined by the Prompt Corrective Action regulations from time to time are merely guidelines and the bank regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios. Further, the risk-based capital standards of the FRB and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank&#8217;s capital due to changes in interest rates. These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management. 

&#160; 

To qualify as a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; institution, a depository institution under the Prompt Corrective Action requirements must have a leverage ratio of no less than 5%, a Tier I Capital ratio of no less than 8%, a CET1 ratio of no less than 6.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10%, and the bank must not have been under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank exceeded the requirements contained in the applicable regulations, policies and directives pertaining to capital adequacy to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221;, and is unaware of any material violation or alleged violation of these regulations, policies or directives. For a tabular presentation of our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank as of December 31, 2015, see Note 8 (Shareholders' Equity) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, which Note 8 is incorporated herein by reference. 

Future rulemaking and regulatory changes on capital requirements may impact the Company as it continues to grow and evaluate potential mergers and acquisitions. 

Restrictions on Bank Dividends or Loans to, or other Transactions with, the Parent Company, and on Parent Company Dividends 

German American Bancorp, Inc., which is the publicly-held parent of the Bank (German American Bancorp), is a corporation that is separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Most of the parent company&#8217;s revenues historically have been comprised of dividends, fees, and interest paid to it by the Bank, and this is expected to continue in the future. There are, however, statutory limits under Indiana law on the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to its parent company without regulatory approval. The Bank may not, without the approval of the DFI, pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the DFI is required for the payment of a dividend by an Indiana state-chartered bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years, unless such a payment qualifies under certain exemptive criteria that exempt certain dividend payments by certain qualified banks from the prior approval requirement. At December 31, 2015, the Bank was eligible for payment of dividends under the exemptive criteria established by DFI policy for this purpose, and could have declared and paid to the holding company $31,000,000 of its undivided profits without approval by the DFI in accordance with such criteria. See Note 8 (Shareholders' Equity) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion. 

In addition, the FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements or advisories that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 

In addition to these statutory restrictions, if, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Accordingly, if the Bank were to experience financial difficulties, it is possible that the applicable regulatory authority could determine that the Bank would be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay dividends and could prohibit the Bank from doing so, even if availability existed for dividends under the statutory formula. 

Further, the Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which limit certain transactions generally involving the transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any nonbank subsidiary of its parent corporation, whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases, or otherwise undertaking certain obligations on behalf of such affiliates. Furthermore, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts. In addition, all covered transactions and other affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities. 

Other Aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act (in addition to the regulatory changes discussed elsewhere in this &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; discussion and below under &#8220;Federal Deposit Insurance Premiums and Assessments&#8221;) made a variety of changes that affect the business and affairs of the Company and the Bank in other ways. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act (or agency regulations adopted and implemented (or to be adopted and implemented) under the Dodd-Frank Act) altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions; restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates; eliminated the former statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts; limited interchange fees on debit card transactions by certain large processors; and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). 

The CFPB was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, Dodd-Frank allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

The CFPB issued a rule, effective as of January 14, 2014, designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that satisfy this &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; safe-harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB&#8217;s rule, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; loan must not contain certain specified features, and the borrower&#8217;s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed a specified percentage. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. 

On December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including the FRB and FDIC, adopted final rules implementing the so-called Volcker Rule added to banking law by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These final rules prohibit banking entities from, among other things, (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;). Community banks like the Bank have been afforded some relief under these final rules from onerous compliance obligations created by the rules; if banks are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. government, agency, state and municipal obligations, they are exempt entirely from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the rule, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures. The Final Rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period was extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2015. In addition, the FRB granted an extension until July 21, 2016 of the conformance period for banking entities to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and announced its intention to further extend this aspect of the conformance period until July 21, 2017. We do not expect that the Volcker Rule will have any material financial implications on us or our investments or activities. 

Certain Other Laws and Regulations 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA") requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. The applicable federal regulators regularly conduct CRA examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution&#8217;s records of meeting the credit needs of its community. During its last examination, a rating of &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; was received by the Bank. 

In accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the "GLB Act"), federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions is combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;) requires financial institutions to develop policies, procedures, and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, and mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. In addition, banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program, and are required to file Suspicious Activity Reports when they detect certain known or suspected violations of federal law or suspicious transactions related to a money laundering activity or a violation of the BSA. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

The Bank is subject to a wide variety of other laws with respect to the operation of its businesses, and regulations adopted under those laws, including but not limited to the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Expedited Funds Availability (Regulation CC), Reserve Requirements (Regulation D), Insider Transactions (Regulation O), Privacy of Consumer Information (Regulation P), Margin Stock Loans (Regulation U), Right To Financial Privacy Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. The laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly under review by Congress, the federal regulatory agencies, and the state authorities. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Premiums and Assessments 

The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") of the FDIC. The insurance benefit generally covers up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As an FDIC-insured bank, our bank subsidiary is subject to deposit insurance premiums and assessments to maintain the DIF. The Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance premium assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. The FDIC has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured banks in order to achieve statutorily required reserve ratios in the DIF and to impose special additional assessments. 

Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns a banking institution to one of four risk categories designed to measure risk. Total base assessment rates currently range from 0.025% of deposits for an institution in the highest rated sub-category of the highest rated category to 0.45% of deposits for an institution in the lowest rated category. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2.0 basis points without further rulemaking. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment. 

In addition, all FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately six tenths of a basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
