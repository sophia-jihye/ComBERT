 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Marketing Areas, and transit advertising displays with exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the United States. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the United States and over 180 markets in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and various sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. With TAB Out of Home Ratings, we are able to provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays. The combination of location and audience delivery is a selling proposition for the out-of-home industry. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a multitude of options to address a wide range of marketing objectives from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local businesses that want to drive customers to their retail location &#8220;one mile down the road.&#8221; 

We believe that out-of-home advertising is an attractive form of advertising as our displays are ALWAYS ON&#8482;, are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped or fast-forwarded, providing our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. We also believe that out-of-home is effective as a &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; medium, and as an integral part of a multi-media campaign, where it can reinforce digital and online ad messaging and/or extend the reach and frequency of traditional media (television, radio and print). In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, consumer insights, creative design support, vinyl production and post-campaign tracking and analytics. We use a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for the majority of our business. We have a diversified base of customers across various industries. 

We generally (i) own the physical billboard structures on which we display advertising copy for our customers, (ii) hold the legal permits to display advertising thereon and (iii) lease the underlying sites. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. We estimate that approximately 75% of our billboard structures in the United States are &#8220;legal nonconforming&#8221; billboards, meaning they were legally constructed under laws in effect at the time they were built, but could not be constructed under current laws. These structures are often located in areas where it is difficult or not permitted to build additional billboards under current laws, which enhances the value of our portfolio. We have a highly diversified portfolio of advertising sites. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 23,000 &#32;lease agreements with approximately 18,500 &#32;different landlords in the United States. A substantial number of these lease agreements allow us to abate rent and/or terminate the lease agreement in certain circumstances, which may include where the structure is obstructed, where there is a change in traffic flow and/or where the advertising value of the sign structure is otherwise impaired, providing us with flexibility in renegotiating the terms of our leases with landlords in those circumstances. 

We manage our business through the following two segments: 

United States. As of December 31, 2015 , we had the largest number of advertising displays of any out-of-home advertising company operating in the 25 largest markets in the United States. Our U.S. segment generated 27% &#32;of its revenues in the New York City metropolitan area in 2015 , and 22% in 2014 &#32;and 20% in 2013 , and generated 14% &#32;in the Los Angeles metropolitan area in 2015 , and 13% in each of 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Our U.S. segment generated Revenues &#32;of $1.38 billion &#32;in 2015 , $1.20 billion &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $1.13 billion &#32;in 2013 , and Operating income &#32;before Depreciation , Amortization , Net (gain) loss on dispositions , Stock-based compensation , Restructuring charges , &#32;Loss on real estate assets held for sale &#32;and Acquisition costs &#32;(&#8220;Adjusted OIBDA&#8221;) of $459.6 million &#32;in 2015 , $416.2 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $406.4 million &#32;in 2013 . 

International . Our International segment includes our operations in Canada and Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. Our International segment generated revenues of $133.5 million &#32;in 2015 , $155.0 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $163.9 million &#32;in 2013 , and Adjusted OIBDA of $15.8 million &#32;in 2015 , $24.3 million &#32;in 2014 , and $29.1 million &#32;in 2013 . 

On October 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our outdoor advertising business in Latin America. See &#8220;&#8212;Acquisition and Disposition Activity.&#8221; 

For additional information regarding our revenues, profits and assets by segment and by geographic area, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

History 

Our corporate history can be traced back to companies that helped to pioneer the growth of out-of-home advertising in the United States, such as Outdoor Systems, Inc., 3M National, Gannett Outdoor and TDI Worldwide Inc. In 1996, a predecessor of CBS Corporation (&#8220;CBS&#8221;) acquired TDI Worldwide Inc., which specialized in transit advertising. Three years later, a predecessor of CBS acquired Outdoor Systems, Inc., which represented the consolidation of the outdoor advertising assets of large national operators such as 3M National, Gannett Outdoor (and its Canadian assets held in the name Mediacom) and Vendor (a Mexican outdoor advertising company) and many local operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2008, we expanded our business into South America through the acquisition of International Outdoor Advertising Holdings Co., which operated in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The company that we are today represents the hard-to-replicate combination of the assets of all of these businesses, as well as other acquisitions and internally developed assets. 

On April 2, 2014, we completed an initial public offering (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) of our common stock. On July 16, 2014, CBS completed a registered offer to exchange 97,000,000 shares of our common stock that were owned by CBS for outstanding shares of CBS Class B common stock (&#8220;the Exchange Offer&#8221;). In connection with the Exchange Offer, CBS disposed of all of its shares of our common stock and as of July 16, 2014, we were separated from CBS (the &#8220;Separation&#8221;) and were no longer a subsidiary of CBS. On July 16, 2014, in connection with the Separation, we ceased to be a member of the CBS consolidated tax group, and on July 17, 2014, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

On November 20, 2014, the Company changed its legal name to &#8220;OUTFRONT Media Inc.&#8221;, and its common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under its new ticker symbol &#8220;OUT.&#8221; 

Acquisition and Disposition Activity 

We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions. On October 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses (the &#8220;Acquired Business&#8221;) of Van Wagner Communications, LLC, for $690.0 million in cash, plus working capital adjustments (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). 

On October 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement with JCDecaux SA (&#8220;JCDecaux&#8221;), JCDecaux Latin America Investments Holding SL Unipersonal, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JCDecaux, and Corporacion Americana de Equipamientos Urbanos, S.L., a majority-owned subsidiary of JCDecaux, to sell all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;), which hold all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America, for $82.0 million &#32;in cash, subject to working capital and indebtedness adjustments. The consummation of the Transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. 

For additional information regarding our acquisition activity, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and &#8220;Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Tax Status 

Our qualification to be taxed as a REIT is dependent on our ability to meet various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), related to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets and the diversity of ownership of our shares. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT.&#8221; As long as we remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a REIT but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined with the above modifications, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax if the amount that we actually distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. 

We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount not less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid). 

We believe we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet those requirements. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from re-electing REIT status for the subsequent four taxable years. Despite our status as a REIT, we will be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property and the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;) will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. 

In order to comply with certain REIT qualification requirements, on October 29, 2014, our board of directors approved a special dividend of $547.7 million, or $4.56 per share, to distribute our accumulated earnings and profits as of July 17, 2014, the date we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including any earnings and profits allocated to the Company by CBS in connection with the Separation (the &#8220;E&#38;P Purge&#8221;). The special dividend was paid on December 31, 2014, to stockholders of record on November 20, 2014. In connection with the special dividend, we paid $109.5 million in cash, and issued 16.5 million new shares of our common stock based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the three trading days commencing on December 16, 2014, or $26.4974 per share. A portion ($100.0 million) of the IPO proceeds was retained by us and was applied to the cash portion of the E&#38;P Purge. CBS transferred the balance of the cash portion of the E&#38;P Purge (approximately $9.5 million) to us prior to the payment of the special dividend to stockholders. 

Prior to the Separation, we were a member of CBS&#8217;s consolidated tax group and were taxable as a regular domestic C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i.e., we were subject to taxation at regular corporate rates). Pursuant to the tax matters agreement that we entered into with CBS, we are liable to pay CBS for any taxes imposed on or related to us while we were a member of the CBS consolidated tax group. In addition, CBS is liable to pay us for any reductions in taxes paid related to us while we were a member of the CBS consolidated tax group. The tax matters agreement also separately allocates among the parties any tax liability arising as a result of any failure of the Separation to qualify as a tax-free transaction based on actions taken during the two-year period following the Separation. After the Separation, CBS ceased to own at least 80% of our outstanding common stock, and as a result, we were no longer a member of CBS&#8217;s consolidated tax group. 

Growth Strategy 

Continued Conversion to Digital Billboard Displays. The majority of our digital billboard displays have been converted from traditional static billboard displays. Increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our most heavily trafficked locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital billboard displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital billboard displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production costs. In addition, digital billboard displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display (up to eight per minute). As a result, digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays, and digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. See &#8220;&#8212;Renovation, Improvement and Development.&#8221; We intend to spend a significant portion of our capital expenditures in the coming years to continue to increase the number of digital billboard displays in our portfolio. 

Drive Enhanced Revenue Management. We focus heavily on inventory management and advertising rate pricing to improve revenue yield over time across our portfolio of advertising structures and sites. By carefully managing our pricing on a market-by-market and display-by-display basis, we aim to improve profitability. We believe that closely monitoring pricing and improving pricing discipline will provide strong potential revenue enhancement. We also explore alternative uses of our billboard locations as they arise to drive site profitability. On July 30, 2015, we reached an agreement with Diamond Communications LLC to market and manage wireless attachment placement opportunities on our leased and owned assets. 

Increased Use of Social Media and Mobile Technology Engagement. We believe there is potential for growth in the reach and effectiveness of out-of-home advertising through increased use of social media and mobile technology engagement. In 2015, we launched the OUTFRONT Mobile Network to create additional opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audience through interactive mobile advertising. We intend to continue to pursue these opportunities, including possible strategic alliances and partnerships with social media and mobile technology companies. 

Consider Selected Acquisition Opportunities. As part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses and assets. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions. See &#8220;&#8212;Acquisition and Disposition Activity.&#8221; There can be no assurances that any transactions currently being evaluated will be consummated or, if consummated, that such transactions would prove beneficial to us. Further, our national footprint in the United States and significant presence in Canada provide us with an attractive platform on which to add additional advertising structures and sites. Our scale gives us advantages in driving additional 

revenues and reducing operating costs from acquired billboards. We believe that there is significant opportunity for additional industry consolidation, and we will evaluate opportunities to acquire additional advertising businesses and structures and sites on a case-by-case basis. 

Continued Adoption &#38; Refinement of Audience Measurement Systems; Utilization of Data/Analytics. We believe the continued adoption and refinement of the out-of-home advertising industry&#8217;s audience measurement system, the &#8220;TAB Out of Home Ratings,&#8221; will enhance the value of the out-of-home medium by providing customers with improved audience measurement and the ability to target by gender, age, ethnicity and income. New refinements, including the impact of speed (i.e. how quickly a vehicle passes an individual billboard unit), and the recent inclusion of transit metrics, are making the measurement system more robust. Additionally, we are developing a platform to enable us to utilize audience data and analytics for more effective ad targeting, which will factor location and time in addition to a more granular audience profile of our locations. By providing a consistent and standardized audience measurement metric, and overlaying increasingly available and reliable third-party data, we will be able to help advertisers impact increasingly mobile audiences with effective media plans in the out-of-home environment for both static and digital displays.

Renovation, Improvement and Development 

Most of our non-maintenance capital expenditures are directed towards new revenue-generating projects, such as the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 604 &#32;digital billboard displays in the United States, representing approximately 1% &#32;of our total billboard displays in the United States. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 73 &#32;digital billboards internationally, representing less than 1% of our total billboard displays outside of the United States. This compares to approximately 511 digital billboard displays in the United States and 48 outside of the United States as of December 31, 2014 , and 373 digital billboards in the United States and 19 outside of the United States as of December 31, 

2013 . As the costs to convert traditional static billboard displays to digital billboard displays and construct new digital billboard displays have declined, we have added 100 &#32;new digital billboard displays in the United States and 25 &#32;outside of the United States in 2015 , compared to 111 &#32;digital billboard displays added in the United States and 29 &#32;added outside of the United States in 2014, and 102 &#32;digital billboard displays added in the United States and 16 &#32;digital billboard displays added outside of the United States in 2013. Revenues related to digital billboards in the United States were $127.6 million &#32;and outside of the United States were $6.4 million &#32;in 2015 , $93.6 million &#32;and $3.8 million in 2014 &#32;and $71.9 million &#32;and $1.0 million in 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , our average initial investment required for a digital billboard display is approximately $250,000. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to three times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue, than traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. We intend to spend a significant portion of our capital expenditures in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital billboard displays in our portfolio. 

In 2016, we initiated a multi-year project to improve the quality of the illumination of our static billboard displays and to reduce our utility costs through the use of the most current LED lighting technology. 

We routinely invest capital in the maintenance and repair of our billboard and transit structures. This includes safety initiatives and replaced displays, as well as new billboard components such as panels, sections, catwalks, lighting and ladders. Our maintenance capital expenditures were $25.6 million &#32;in 2015 , $23.3 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $23.7 million &#32;in 2013 . 

In the opinion of management, our outdoor advertising sites and structures are adequately covered by insurance. 

Contract Expirations 

We derive revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year and are generally billed every four weeks. Since contract terms are short-term in nature, revenues by year of contract expiration are not considered meaningful. 

For information about the property lease contracts relating to our advertising structures and sites, see &#8220;Item 2. Properties.&#8221; 

Competition 

The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of a large number of companies operating on a national basis, including, among others, our company, Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar and JCDecaux, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional platforms such as broadcast and cable television, radio, print media and direct mail marketers. In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media, including average cost per thousand impressions or &#8220;CPMs&#8221;, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to reach specific markets, geographic areas and/or demographics. 

Seasonality 

Our revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers cut back on spending following the holiday shopping season. We expect this trend to continue in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 2,581 employees, of which 669 were sales personnel in our U.S. segment and 171 were sales personnel in our International segment. As of December 31, 2015 , 2,534 of our employees were full-time employees and 47 were part-time employees. Some of these employees are represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 

Regulation 

The outdoor advertising industry is subject to governmental regulation and enforcement at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and to national, regional and local laws and regulations in foreign countries. These regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. The descriptions that follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the regulations described herein, which are subject to change. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed regulations affecting our businesses. 

In the United States, the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the &#8220;HBA&#8221;) establishes a framework for the regulation of outdoor advertising on primary and interstate highways built with federal financial assistance. As a condition to federal highway assistance, the HBA requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas, and imposes certain size, spacing and other requirements associated with the installation and operation of billboards. The HBA requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings, on affected roadways. 

Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes, and many have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements. Some state and local government regulations prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures. Other state and local regulations and national, regional and local laws and regulations in foreign countries prohibit the relocation or modification of existing billboards, limit the ability to rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade &#8220;legal nonconforming&#8221; structures (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which no longer conform to current zoning regulations), and impose restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, operation, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location of outdoor structures, and the use of new technologies such as digital signs. In addition, from time to time, third parties or local governments commence proceedings in which they assert that we own or operate structures that are not properly permitted or otherwise in strict compliance with applicable law. 

Governmental regulation of advertising displays also limits our installation of additional advertising displays, restricts advertising displays to governmentally controlled sites or permits the installation of advertising displays in a manner that benefits our competitors disproportionately, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Although state and local government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards, U.S. law requires payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. Additionally, many states require similar compensation (or relocation) with regard to compelled removals of lawful billboards in other locations, although the methodology used to determine such compensation varies by jurisdiction. Some local governments have attempted to force removal of billboards after a period of years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation has been earned by continued operation of the billboard over a period of time. Thus far, we have generally been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. 

From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. Several jurisdictions have already imposed such taxes based on a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue in that jurisdiction. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in outdoor advertising locations using various other valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing their revenue. In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of other targeted taxes and fees. 

These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways. Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry. However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business. 

A number of foreign, state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes (including taxes on revenues from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets), fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor advertising structures and sites or raise revenues, or both. Restrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products and services are or may be imposed by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, tobacco products have been effectively banned from outdoor advertising in all of the jurisdictions in which we currently do business. 

As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations related to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances and employee health and safety. Historically, with the exception of safety upgrades, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. 

We intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the United States and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. Furthermore, as digital advertising displays are introduced into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital advertising displays by their terms could be revised to impose specific restrictions on digital advertising displays due to alleged concerns over, among other things, aesthetics or driver safety. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 

The following is a discussion of certain of our investment, financing and other policies. We intend to conduct our business in a manner such that we are not treated as an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In addition, we intend to conduct our business in a manner that is consistent with maintaining our qualification to be taxed as a REIT. These policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. 

Investment Policies 

Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate . Our investment objective is to maximize income. We intend to achieve this objective by developing our existing advertising structures and sites, including through the digital modernization of such advertising structures and sites, and by acquiring new advertising structures and sites. We currently intend to invest in advertising structures and sites located primarily in major metropolitan areas. Future development or investment activities will not be limited to any specific percentage of our assets or to any geographic area or type of advertising structure or site. While we may diversify in terms of location, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area. In addition, we may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment, improve the properties we presently own or other acquired properties, or lease such properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. 

We may also enter into multiyear contracts with municipalities and transit operators for the exclusive right to display advertising copy on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars, buses, benches, trams, trains, transit shelters, street kiosks and transit platforms. In addition, we may participate with third parties in property ownership through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. We will not, however, enter into a joint venture or other partnership arrangement to make an investment that would not otherwise meet our investment policies. 

Investments in acquired advertising structures and sites may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness that may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. We do not currently have any restrictions on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any one advertising site or structure. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock. 

Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers. We may in the future invest in securities of other issuers, including REITs and entities engaged in real estate activities and including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities, although we have not done so during the past three years. However, because we must comply with various requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) in order to maintain our qualification to be taxed as a REIT, including restrictions on the types of assets we may hold, the sources of our income and accumulation of earnings and profits, our ability to engage in certain acquisitions, such as acquisitions of C corporations, may be limited. 

Investments in Other Securities. We may in the future invest in additional securities such as bonds, preferred stock and common stock. We have no present intention to make any such investments, except for investments in cash equivalents in the ordinary course of business. Future investment activities in additional securities will not be limited to any specific percentage of our assets or to any specific type of securities or industry group. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we have both acquired and disposed of advertising structures and sites in order to optimize our portfolio, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. See &#8220;&#8212;Acquisition and Disposition Activity&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Growth Strategy.&#8221; 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages. We have not invested in, nor do we have any present intention to invest in, real estate mortgages, although we are not prohibited from doing so. 

Financing and Leverage Policy 

We may, when appropriate, employ leverage and use debt as a means to refinance existing debt, to provide additional funds to distribute to stockholders, and/or for corporate purposes, including asset acquisitions. On January 31, 2014, our subsidiaries, Outfront Media Capital LLC (&#8220;Finance LLC&#8221;) and Outfront Media Capital Corporation (&#8220;Finance Corp.&#8221; and together with Finance LLC, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;) borrowed $800.0 million under a term loan due in 2021 (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;), and entered into a $425.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2019 (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221; and, together with the Term Loan, the &#8220;Senior Credit Facilities&#8221;). On January 31, 2014, the Borrowers also issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (together, the &#8220;Formation Notes&#8221;; we refer to the issuance of the Formation Notes and the borrowings under the Term Loan as the &#8220;Formation Borrowings&#8221;) in a private placement. In addition, on October 1, 2014, the Borrowers issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 (together, the &#8220;Acquisition Notes&#8221;; we refer to the issuance of the Acquisition Notes to finance a portion of the consideration for the Acquisition as the &#8220;Acquisition Borrowings&#8221;) in a private placement. On March 30, 2015, the Borrowers issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (the &#8220;Add-on Notes&#8221; and, collectively, with the Formation Notes and Acquisition Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) in a private placement. We have, and from time to time we may, draw funds from the Revolving Credit Facility for specific or general corporate purposes. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; Other than as described above, we have not borrowed any money from third parties during the past three years. 

Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we adopted any policies addressing this. The credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, and the indentures governing the Notes contain, and any future debt agreements may contain, covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Our board of directors may limit our debt incurrence to be more restrictive than our debt covenants allow and from time to time may modify these restrictions in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. If these restrictions are relaxed, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and a related increase in debt service requirements. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.&#8221; 

Lending Policies 

We do not intend to engage in significant lending activities, although we do not have a policy limiting our ability to make loans to third parties. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties. Other than loans to joint ventures in which we participate, loans to joint venture partners, and loans to our employees, subject to applicable laws, which we have made, and may continue to make, we have not made any loans to third parties in the past three years. 

Company Securities Policies 

In the future, we may issue debt securities, including senior securities, offer common stock, preferred stock or options to purchase stock in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our common stock or other securities in the open market or otherwise. Except in connection with the IPO, the Exchange Offer, the Formation Borrowings, the Acquisition Borrowings, the Add-on Notes, the E&#38;P Purge, exchanges of publicly registered notes for privately issued notes, equity private placements relating to a license and development agreement and stock-based employee compensation, in the past three years, we have not issued debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, options to purchase stock or any other securities in exchange for property or any other purpose. Our board of directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to authorize us to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, in one or more series, including senior securities, in any manner, and on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate, subject to applicable laws and regulations. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so. 

We make available to our stockholders our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited financial statements, and other required periodic reports filed with the SEC. See &#8220;&#8212;Available Information.&#8221; 

Conflict of Interest Policies 

Policies Applicable to All Directors and Officers. The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all executive officers, employees and directors of the Company. In addition, the Company has adopted a Supplemental Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer and controller or persons performing similar functions. The Code of Conduct and Supplemental Code of Ethics are designed to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between our employees, officers and directors and us. However, there can be no assurance that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating the influence of such conflicts. 

Interested Director and Officer Transactions. Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law (the &#8220;MGCL&#8221;), a contract or other transaction between us and any of our directors or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or interest, the presence of such director at the meeting of the board of directors or committee of the board of directors at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the director&#8217;s vote in favor thereof, provided that: &#32; (1) the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of directors or a committee of our board, and our board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; (2) the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares owned of record or beneficially owned by the interested director or corporation, firm or other entity; or (3) the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us.
