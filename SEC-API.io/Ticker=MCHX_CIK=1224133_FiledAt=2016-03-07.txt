 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview 

References herein to &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148; refer to Marchex, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise. 

Marchex is an advertising analytics company. We power global brands to truly understand the mobile consumer journey by connecting online behavior to real-world, offline actions. 

We believe that mobile has forever changed the consumer journey. We are spending more time than ever on our smartphones. It&#146;s second nature to research on mobile devices and interact with a business either over the phone or in a store. We believe that understanding this behavior and connecting key data points of this new online-to-offline consumer journey is the next frontier in marketing analytics. 

We believe we have a powerful set of tools for enterprises that depend on phone calls to maximize advertising returns. Our mission is to connect key media sources&#150; paid, earned and owned &#150; to any offline purchase outcome and deliver this data in real-time directly into marketer workflows. 

We provide products and services for enterprises that depend on consumer phone calls to drive sales. Our media analytics products can connect call data to media channels &#150; including search and display&#150; down to the campaign, keyword and impression so marketers can maximize advertising returns. Our sales analytics products deliver actionable intelligence on the offline consumer journey to help prospects become customers. 

Our primary product offerings are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Marchex Call Analytics. Marchex Call Analytics is an analytics platform for enterprises that depend on inbound phone calls to drive sales, appointments and reservations. Marketers use this platform to understand which marketing channels, advertisements, keywords and creatives are driving calls to their 

&#160;

&#160; business, allowing them to optimize their advertising expenditures across media channels. Marchex Call Analytics also includes technology that can extract data and insights about what is happening during a call and measures the outcome of calls and return on investment. The platform also includes technology that blocks robocalls, telemarketers and spam calls to save businesses time. Marchex Call Analytics data can integrate directly into third-party marketer workflows such as Salesforce, Eloqua, Adobe, Kenshoo, DoubleClick Search, Marin Software and many other marketing dashboards and tools. Advertisers pay us a fee for each call or call related data element they receive from calls including call-based ads we distribute through our sources of call distribution or for each phone number tracked based on pre-negotiated rates. 

Marchex Call Analytics for Search. Marchex Call Analytics for Search is a product for search marketers that drive phone calls from search campaigns. Marchex Call Analytics for Search attributes inbound phone calls made directly from paid search ads and landing pages to a keyword. The platform can deliver this data as well as data about call outcomes directly into search management platforms like DoubleClick Search and Kenshoo. According to a June 2015 BIA Kelsey report, phone calls from search to businesses from smartphones will reach over 40 billion and the number of mobile searches will exceed desktop searches in 2016. 

Marchex Display Analytics . Marchex Display Analytics, currently in beta, is a product for marketers that buy digital display advertising. Marchex Display Analytics can measure the influence that display advertising has on inbound phone calls so that marketers can better attribute their return on advertising spend for inbound phone calls and delivers this data to marketers in a reporting dashboard. According to a March 2015 eMarketer report, display advertising spend is expected to reach over $37 billion in the US by 2017. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Marchex Call Marketplace . Marchex Call Marketplace is a mobile advertising network for businesses that depend on inbound phone calls to drive sales. We offer advertisers ad placements across numerous mobile and online media sources to deliver qualified calls to their businesses. It leverages Marchex Call Analytics platform for tracking, reporting and optimization. Advertisers are charged on a pay-per-call or cost per action basis. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Local Leads . Our Local Leads platform is a white-labeled, full service advertising solution for small business resellers, such as Yellow Pages providers and vertical marketing service providers, to sell call advertising, search marketing and other lead generation products through their existing sales channels to their small business advertisers. These calls and leads are then fulfilled by us across our distribution network, including mobile sources, and search engines. The lead services we offer to small business advertisers through our Local Leads platform include pay-for-call, search marketing and ad creation and include advanced features such as call tracking, geo-targeting, campaign management, reporting and analytics. The Local Leads platform is highly scalable and has the capacity to support hundreds of thousands of advertiser accounts. Reseller partners and publishers generally pay us account fees and agency fees for our products in the form of a percentage of the cost of every click or call delivered to their advertisers. Through our contract with Yellowpages.com LLC (&#147;YP&#148;), we generate revenues from our local leads platform. We also have a separate pay-for-call services arrangement with YP. In 2015, we extended these agreements through December 31, 2016. The primary local leads platform arrangement includes certain minimum fee commitments by YP through the first half of 2016 and provides YP additional flexibility to migrate active accounts to itself or a third-party provider prior to the end of an advertiser contract. YP is our largest reseller partner and was responsible for 25%, 25% and 29% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We also have a separate distribution partner agreement with YP. We historically generated revenue from two business segments: Call-driven and Archeo. Call-driven revenue consists of payments from advertisers for pay-for-call marketing services and for use of our call analytics technology. Call-driven revenue also consists of payments from our reseller partners for use of our local leads technology platform and marketing services, which they offer to their small business customers, as well as 

&#160;

payments from advertisers for cost-per-action services. Archeo revenue includes revenue generated from advertisements on our previously owned and operated websites and third-party distribution. In December 2015, we sold the remaining Archeo operations. This disposition did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations, and as a result the operating results are reflected in continuing operations under the Archeo segment. We do not expect to generate any significant Archeo revenue after December 31, 2015. Prior to the December 2015 disposition, we sold certain assets related to Archeo&#146;s pay-per-click advertising services in July 2013 and, in April 2015, we sold certain assets related to Archeo&#146;s domain operations, including the bulk of its domain name portfolio. The operating results related to these dispositions are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. See Note 10. Discontinued Operations and Disposition for further discussion regarding the dispositions. For detail on revenue by segment and geographical area for the three most recent fiscal years, see Note 9. Segment Reporting and Geographic Information of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We operate primarily in domestic markets. 

Industry Overview 

Calls are critical for businesses to drive sales. For businesses of all sizes, in-bound phones calls are a key source of new customer leads and increased revenue. We believe consumers that call businesses directly typically have higher purchase intent and are more likely to make a purchase or become a customer. According to BIA/Kelsey Local Commerce Monitor (LCM) survey in 2014, 66% of advertisers rate phone calls as a good or excellent source of leads, more than any other category. Calls are particularly relevant in high-value categories, such as professional services, financial services, automotive and travel, where transaction values are large, complex or require additional information prior to completion. Calls are also important for local businesses that set appointments or sell products and services over the phone. According to an April 2014 BIA/Kelsey report, advertisers in the U.S. spend an estimated $68 billion each year to drive telephone leads. Historically, the majority of this advertising has been spent on traditional media such as television, newspapers and directories. Now with the mass adoption of mobile, both large and small advertisers are increasingly seeking new marketing channels that allow them to connect with consumers over the phone. According to a June 2015 BIA/Kelsey report, mobile calls to businesses will grow to 162 billion in 2019, up from 93 billion in 2015. 

Mobile search and calls from search are growing rapidly . Today we are witnessing an evolution in consumer behavior as Internet-enabled mobile devices proliferate and media consumption shifts to mobile devices. This trend is increasingly evident in the way consumers research products and services and connect with businesses through the phone or through walking into a store, both offline environments, when they are ready to make a purchase decision. According to a 2013 study by Google/Ipsos, over 70% of mobile search users have used a click-to-call feature to connect with a business directly from their mobile devices. According to a BIA/Kelsey study in January 2014, mobile searches also have higher conversion rates in driving calls (57%) compared to desktop searches (7%). Mobile users are more ready-to-buy, in the right location and with a device whose core function is to make phone calls. 

Ad budgets are shifting to performance-based models . As businesses have expanded their marketing through digital channels, they have increasingly turned to performance-based advertising formats in which they are only charged when a desired outcome is reached. Performance-based advertising models provide advertisers with greater transparency into their advertising spend and the ability to accurately measure results and return on investment. Over time, the online advertising market has shifted from CPM-based banner and display advertisements to cost-per-click search advertising and other forms of performance marketing. According to Interactive Advertising Bureau&#146;s October 2015 advertising revenue report, performance-based formats accounted for over 66% of the $50 billion market in 2015 compared to 7% of the $5 billion online advertising market in 1999. 

Calls are becoming the currency of mobile advertising. The global mobile advertising market was $19 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow to $196 billion by 2019, according to an April 2015 eMarketer report. As the mobile advertising market matures, we believe advertisers will increasingly utilize performance based advertising formats available on mobile devices, as they did on desktop. Further, we believe the demand for 

&#160;

businesses to connect with consumers over the phone combined with the inherent functionality and technical capabilities of mobile devices will result in calls becoming a primary measurement unit/format for mobile advertising. As advertisers continue to shift their budgets to accommodate for the growth of mobile and online channels, we believe the market for call-driven advertising will grow even more. 

Understanding calls is highly complex. Unlike clicks, impressions and other actions that are tracked and measured in digital format, calls take place offline and require unique technical capabilities and expertise to accurately measure and analyze. To realize the full benefit of call-based marketing, advertisers need technology that allows them to capture and analyze attributes of a call before, during and after the call is completed. This technology helps them properly measure return on investment (&#147;ROI&#148;) and optimize their marketing campaigns across media channels. For example, advertisers must be able to dynamically track the source of a call back to the media channels and advertisements that influenced the consumer to make the call. Once a call is initiated, technology is required to understand what is happening on a call in real-time, to record calls, and to block unwanted or spam calls. For advertisers with call center operations, calls are often tracked and routed through interactive voice response (&#147;IVR&#148;) phone systems and integrated with customer relationship management (&#147;CRM&#148;) applications and back-office systems to measure transactions and return on investment. Successful marketing analytics for calls requires expertise from multiple disciplines, including digital advertising, communications infrastructure, voice and speech recognition expertise, and marketing software. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

Focus on calls. We were early to realize the value of calls and the importance that mobile devices would play in advertising. Over the past several years, we have shifted the focus of our company to address the large opportunity for mobile performance-based advertising focused on driving offline actions like calls. As a pioneer in the category, we have developed a unique business model that delivers measurable return on investment to both large national advertisers and local small businesses. Our technology platform and call analytics technology and products are specifically designed to address the unique challenges associated with closing the loop between digital marketing and phone calls. Working closely with our customers, we have innovated in call-based technology, creating specific solutions to address common needs and wants among both large enterprise advertisers and SMBs. We believe we are unique with our call-focused approach to technology developments and marketing solutions, providing a competitive advantage as mobile advertising grows and advertising budgets shift towards performance-based formats. 

Proprietary call analytics technology. Marchex Call Analytics technology provides data and insights to advertisers looking to measure the performance of their mobile, online, and offline ad campaigns. When consumers call a business or call center from their smartphones, our technology can analyze that conversation data in real time and provides detailed feedback to advertisers on the quality of these over-the-phone experiences. Our data also helps advertisers adjust and improve their marketing strategies in order to drive more sales over the phone. This intelligence helps advertisers to optimize their ad campaigns across media channels, keywords, and creative elements, which maximizes their return on investment. We also provide integrations with other marketing dashboards to give advertisers one place to review their analytics information. Integrations may take the form of working with CRM platforms or customer-specific systems, with the purpose of enhancing advertisers&#146; understanding and measurement of outcomes at scale. We are consistently working to create products to help advertisers spend their budgets more efficiently, whether the channel is online, offline, or mobile and search-based. For example, our Call Analytics for Search technology tracks every consumer call from a mobile search campaign at the keyword level. It can determine in real time which of these calls converts into a sale. Access to these insights provides advertisers newfound visibility and measurement into their ad expenditures. 

Transparent, performance-based model. We have developed a unique, pay-for-call business model that aligns our interests with those of our advertising customers and our publishing partners. We work closely with each customer to define a quality call for their business, and then only charge our customers, on a per call basis. As a 

&#160;

result, we are able to deliver qualified leads that provide a measurable return on investment for our advertisers. We typically pay our publishing partners a percentage of the revenue we generate from advertisements on their properties. Through our Call Analytics, we have a deep understanding of which publishers, devices, ad formats, keywords and ad creatives drive call conversion for specific advertising verticals. This allows us to help optimize the placements of advertisements across our network to maximize the number of calls for our advertisers and revenue for our partners. As a result, advertisers utilize us to place ads on their behalf and our partners believe in us that we will only deliver ads on their properties to help generate revenue for them. 

Scalable technology platform and business model. We have developed our technology platform to address the large advertisers, while also being able to support a large number of small local business advertisers. Our platform can support hundreds of millions of calls and over 100,000 unique advertiser accounts, and in aggregate manages hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising spend across various digital channels. We leverage our relationships with Yellow Pages providers and vertical market service providers to efficiently re-sell our solutions to their small businesses customers, adding scale and data to our platform, which provides us with recurring revenues with minimal associated sales costs. We have deployed a direct sales model to acquire and service large advertisers and also have been successful at deepening our relationships with existing advertiser clients over time in an effort to capture a greater share of their advertising budgets. 

Strategy 

Our Strategy 

To take advantage of the shift to performance-based models in marketing, key elements of our strategy include: 

Innovating on Our Mobile Performance Advertising . We plan to continue to expand our range of call-based advertising product capabilities and channel specific solutions by offering innovative performance-based products such as pay-for-call advertising, along with the supporting analytics including number provisioning, call tracking, call mining, keyword-level tracking, display ad impression measurement and other products as part of our owned, end-to-end, call-based advertising solutions. We are also focused on growing our base of call distribution by bringing in new sources of the rapidly growing mobile advertising market as well as other online and offline sources of distribution. 

Building and Expanding Relationships with Advertising Agencies. Advertising agencies are influential in determining how large national advertisers allocate their advertising budgets. We believe building deep relationships with leading global advertising agencies and creating awareness within these agencies about the benefits of our offerings is an important step in attracting new large advertising customers. We plan to expand our agency relations efforts and hire personnel with strong existing relationships with advertising agencies. 

Developing New Markets including International Expansion. We have expanded our Marchex Call Analytics product internationally, making it available within Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We intend to analyze opportunities and may seek to expand our technology-based products into new business areas or geographic markets where our services can be replicated on a cost-effective basis, or where the creation or development of a product or service may be appropriate. We anticipate utilizing various strategies to enter new markets, including: developing strategic relationships; acquiring products that address a new category or opportunity; and creating joint venture relationships and internal initiatives where existing services can be extended internationally. 

Supporting and Growing the Number of Advertisers Using Our Products and Services. We plan to continue to provide a consistently high level of service and support to our advertisers and we will continue to help them achieve their return on investment goals. We are focused on continuing to grow our advertiser base through our direct sales and marketing efforts, including strategic sales, inside sales, and additional partnerships with large local advertiser resellers. 

&#160;

Pursuing Selective Acquisition Opportunities. We may pursue select acquisition opportunities and will apply rigorous evaluation criteria to any acquisitions we may pursue in order to enhance our strategic position, strengthen our financial profile, augment our points of defensibility and increase shareholder value. We will focus on acquisition opportunities that represent a combination of the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; under-leveraged and under-commercialized assets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; opportunities for business model, product or service innovation and evolution; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; critical mass of transactions volume, advertisers, traffic, revenue and profits; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; business defensibility; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; revenue growth and expanding margins and operating profitability or the characteristics to achieve significant scale and profitability; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; an opportunity to enhance efficiencies and provide incremental growth opportunities for our operating businesses. Our Distribution Network 

We have built a broad distribution network for our pay-for-call advertising services that includes hundreds of mobile sources, search engines and applications, directories, third party vertical and branded web sites, and offline sources. Through our call advertising services, our local leads, and search marketing services, we distribute advertisements from our tens of thousands of advertisers, as well as from our reseller partners&#146; advertisers, through hundreds of call-ready media and traffic sources, including mobile sources, search engines and directories, and web sites. 

Our Distribution partners include: 

&#160;

Selected Carriers 

&#160; AT&#38;T &#160; T-Mobile &#160; TracFone &#160; Verizon Selected Search Engines 

&#160; Google &#160; Bing &#160; Yahoo! &#160; Selected Call Sources and Vertical and Local Distribution 

&#160; Avantar 

Mapquest 

&#160; CityGrid 

MSN 

&#160; Google Mobile 

Whitepages, Inc. 

&#160; Payment arrangements with our distribution partners are often subject to minimum payment amounts per phone call. Other payment structures that we may use to a lesser degree include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; variable payments based on a specified metric, such as number of paid phone calls; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; advance or fixed payments, based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a combination arrangement with both fixed and variable amounts. Sales, Marketing &#38; Business Development 

Our sales department focuses on adding new advertisers to our business, while our business development and partnership department focuses on adding new reseller partnerships, selectively adding new distribution partnerships and servicing existing partnerships. Our marketing department focuses on promoting our services through online customer acquisition, affiliate relationships, press coverage, strategic marketing campaigns and industry exposure. Advertising and promotion of our services is broken into the following main categories: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Direct Sales. Our direct sales team targets new relationships with national and global advertisers and the advertising agencies that represent them through in-person presentations, direct marketing, telesales and attendance at industry events, among other methods. Our advertiser agreements include a combination of agency fees, pay-for-call fees, cost-per-action fees and pay-per-click fees. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Agency and Reseller Partnerships. We have a business development team that focuses primarily on securing partnerships with agencies and large local advertiser reseller partners, under which we supply and integrate our products and services. Our agency and reseller partner agreements include a combination of revenue and profit sharing, licensing revenue, pay-for-call, cost-per-action, and pay-per-click fees. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Referral Agreements and Technology Integration Partners. We have referral agreements with entities that promote our services to large numbers of potential advertisers including select technology partners. Our referral partner agreements are based on a combination of revenue sharing and performance-based fees. We intend to continue our strategy of growing our advertiser base through sales and marketing programs while being as efficient as possible in terms of our marketing and advertising costs. We continually evaluate our marketing and advertising strategies to maximize the effectiveness of our programs and their return on investment. 

Information Technology and Systems 

We have a proprietary technology platform for the purposes of managing and delivering call, click-based, and cost-per-action advertising products and services to our partners. We also combine third party licenses and hardware to create an operating environment for delivering high quality products and services, with such features as automated online account creation and management process for advertisers, real-time customer support with both interactive and online reporting for customers and partners. We employ commercially available technologies and products distributed by various companies, including Cisco, Dell, Oracle, Intel, AMD, Microsoft, IBM, Nuance and Veritas. We also utilize public domain software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Java, Scala and Tomcat. 

Our technology platform is compatible with the systems used by our distribution partners, enabling us to deliver call, click-based, and cost-per-action advertising products and services through mobile, online and offline sources in rapid response to user queries made through such partners at scale. We continue to build and innovate additional functionality to attempt to meet the quickly evolving demands of the marketplace. We devote significant financial and human resources to improving our advertiser and partner experiences by continuing to develop our technology infrastructure. The cost of developing our technology solutions is included in the overall cost structure of our services and is not separately funded by any individual advertisers or partners. In order to maintain a professional level of service and availability, we primarily rely upon third parties to provide hosting services, including hardware support and service, and network monitoring at various domestic and international locations. Our servers are configured for high availability and large volumes of call, mobile and Internet traffic and are located in leased third party facilities. Back-end databases make use of redundant servers and data storage arrays. We also have standby servers that provide for additional capacity as necessary. The facilities housing our servers provide redundant HVAC, power and internet connectivity. As revenue grows and the volume of transactions and call, mobile and internet traffic increases, we will need to expand our network infrastructure. Inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher call, mobile and internet traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 

We continuously review ways to improve major aspects of our technology support and maintenance, including improving, upgrading and implementing business continuity plans, data retention initiatives, and backup and recovery processes. 

Competition 

Our Call-driven offerings currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. We currently or potentially compete with leading search engines such as 

&#160;

Google and Microsoft, call analytics technology providers such as Twilio and Telemetrics, mobile ad networks and digital advertising networks. As we continue to advance our data analytics technologies, we anticipate facing increased competition from companies providing broader advertising solutions. We also face competition on the call supply side, where competing companies look to outbid, partner with or otherwise secure sources of call supply we utilize. Many of our potential competitors, as well as potential entrants into our target markets, have longer operating histories, larger customer or user bases, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many current and potential competitors can devote substantially greater resources than we can to marketing, web site and systems development. In addition, as the use of the mobile, Internet, and other online services increases, there will likely be larger, more well-established and well-financed entities that acquire companies relevant to our business strategy; and invest in or form joint ventures in categories or countries relevant to our business strategy; all of which could adversely impact our business. Any of these trends could increase competition, reduce the demand for any of our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

We believe our strategy allows us to work with most, if not all, of the relevant companies in our industry, even those companies that may be perceived as our competitors. To some extent, we may compete with our business partners, as we do with all other types of advertising sales companies and agencies. We may also compete with traditional offline media, such as television, radio and print and direct marketing companies, for a share of advertisers&#146; total advertising budgets. Although our strategy enables us to work with most, if not all, of our competitors, there are no guarantees that all companies will view us as a potential partner. 

We provide our services to and also may compete with: (1) mobile and online advertisers; (2) partners who provide a distribution network for mobile, online, and offline advertising; and (3) other intermediaries who may provide purchasing and/or sales opportunities, including advertising agencies, and other search engine marketing companies. Many of the companies that could fall into these categories are also our partners, including Google, Yahoo!, Citysearch, Microsoft and YP. We depend on maintaining and continually expanding our network of partners and advertisers to generate mobile and online transactions. 

The mobile and online advertising and marketing services industry is highly competitive. In addition, we believe today&#146;s typical Internet and mobile advertiser is becoming more sophisticated in utilizing the different forms of Internet and mobile advertising, purchasing Internet and mobile advertising in a cost-effective manner, and measuring return on investment. The competition for this pool of advertising dollars has also put downward pressure on price points and mobile and online advertisers have demanded more effective means of reaching customers. We believe these factors have contributed to the growth in performance-based advertising relative to certain other forms of online advertising and marketing, and as a result this sector has attracted many competitors. 

Due to the long-term growth trends in mobile and online advertising, these competitors, real and potential, range in size and focus. Our competitors may include such diverse participants as small referral companies, established advertising agencies, inventory resellers, search engines, and destination web sites. We are also affected by the competition among destination web sites that reach users or customers of search services. While thousands of smaller outlets are available to customers, several large media and search engine companies, such as Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft and IAC, dominate online user traffic. The online search industry continues to experience consolidation of major web sites and search engines, which has the effect of increasing the negotiating power of these parties in relation to smaller providers. The major destination web sites and distribution providers may have leverage to demand more favorable contract terms, such as pricing, renewal and termination provisions. 

There are additional competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users, including the quality and relevance of our search results, and the usefulness, accessibility, integration and personalization of the mobile and online services that we offer as well as the overall user experience on our web sites. The other features that we offer, which we believe attract advertisers are reach, effectiveness and creativity of marketing services, and tools and information to help track performance. 

&#160;

Finally, we operate in the relatively nascent market of call-based advertising. The adoption of these call-based products could take longer than we expect and could become more competitive as the category becomes more developed and visible. 

Seasonality 

We believe we will experience seasonality. Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of mobile and Internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers. Our experience has shown that during the spring and summer months, mobile and Internet usage is lower than during other times of the year and during the latter part of the fourth quarter of the calendar year we generally experience lower call volume and reduced demand for calls from our call advertising customers. The extent to which usage and call volume may decrease during these off-peak periods is difficult to predict. Prolonged or severe decreases in usage and call volume during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results and in turn the market price of our securities. In the first quarter of the calendar year, this trend generally reverses with increased mobile and Internet usage and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for many of our customers with fiscal years ending December 31. The seasonal purchasing cycles of some customers in certain industries may also be higher in the first half versus the latter half of the calendar year. Additionally, the current business environment has generally resulted in advertisers and reseller partners reducing advertising and marketing services budgets or changing such budgets throughout the year, which we expect will impact our quarterly results of operations in addition to the typical seasonality seen in our industry. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

We seek to protect our intellectual property through existing laws and regulations and by contractual restrictions. We rely upon trademark, patent and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to help us protect our intellectual property. 

Our technologies involve a combination of proprietary rights, owned and developed by us, commercially available software and hardware elements that are licensed or purchased by us from various providers, including Cisco, Dell, Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, IBM and Veritas, and public domain software, such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, IBM Java and Tomcat. We continue to develop additional technologies to update, supplement and replace existing components of the platform. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through patent and additional intellectual property laws. 

Our policy is to apply for patents or for other appropriate intellectual property protection when we develop valuable new or improved technology. We currently own the following pending patent applications and issued patents:

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Patent Application Number 14/714,141 entitled &#147;Call Analytics for Mobile Advertising&#148; was filed May 15, 2015. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Patent Application Number 14/721,912 entitled Identifying Call Components to Detect Call Traffic Pumping and Taking Corrective Action without Using Recording, Transcription or Caller ID&#148; was filed May 26, 2015, claiming priority to 62/159,086 filed May 8, 2015. The status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions. The scope of allowable claims is often uncertain. As a result, we cannot be sure that: (1) any patent application filed by us will result in a patent being issued; (2) that any patents issued in the future will afford adequate protection against competitors with similar technology; and (3) that the patents issued to us, if any, will not be infringed upon or designed around by others. Furthermore, the performance-based mobile and search advertising industry has been the subject of numerous patents and patent applications, which in turn has resulted in litigation. The mobile advertising industry is also witnessing a significant number of patent related lawsuits. The outcome of this ongoing litigation or any future claims in this sector may adversely affect our business or financial prospects. 

We have registered trademarks in the United States for Marchex, Marchex and Design, Marchex Voice Services, JingleConnect, Clean Call, and Call DNA. We also own pending U.S. trademark applications for Call Genome and Search Genome. In addition, we have trademark registrations for Marchex in the following jurisdictions: Australia, Benelux, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and Taiwan. 

We do not know whether we will be able to successfully defend our proprietary rights since the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. 

Regulation 

The manner in which existing laws and regulations should be applied to the Internet and call-based advertising services in general, and how they relate to our businesses in particular, is unclear. A host of federal and state laws covering user privacy, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gambling, sweepstakes, promotions, financial market regulation, quality of products and services, computer trespass, telemarketing, spyware, adware, child protection and intellectual property ownership and infringement are potentially applicable to our business practices and the content offered by our mobile and online distribution partners. 

In addition, our business is impacted by laws in a constant state of flux, and new legislation is introduced on a regular basis. Any such new legislation could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations. Courts may apply each of these laws in unintended and unexpected ways. As a company that provides services over the Internet as well as call recording and call tracking services, we may be subject to an action brought under any of these or future laws. 

A number of federal and state laws that could have an impact on our business practices and compliance costs have already been adopted: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides protection from copyright liability for online service providers that list or link to third party web sites. We currently qualify for the safe harbor under the DMCA; however, if it were determined that we did not meet the safe harbor requirements, we could be exposed to copyright infringement litigation, which could be costly and time-consuming. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Children&#146;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) restricts the online collection of personal information about children and the use of that information. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the authority to impose fines and penalties upon web site operators and online service providers that do not comply with the law&#146;s requirements. We do not currently offer any web sites or online services &#147;directed to children,&#148; nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003 establishes requirements for those who send commercial e-mails, spells out penalties for entities that transmit noncompliant commercial e-mail and/or whose products are advertised in noncompliant commercial e-mail and gives consumers the right to opt-out of receiving commercial e-mails. The majority of the states also have adopted similar statutes governing the transmission of commercial e-mail. The FTC and the states, as applicable, are authorized to enforce the CAN-SPAM Act and the state-specific statutes, respectively. CAN-SPAM gives the Department of Justice the authority to enforce its criminal sanctions. Other federal and state agencies can enforce the law against organizations under their jurisdiction, and companies that provide Internet access may sue violators as well. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Electronic Communications Privacy Act prevents private entities from disclosing Internet subscriber records and the contents of electronic communications, subject to certain exceptions. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other federal and state laws protect computer users from unauthorized computer access/hacking, and other actions by third parties which may be viewed as a violation of privacy. Courts may apply each of these laws in unintended and unexpected ways. As a company that provides services over the Internet as well as call recording and call tracking services, we may be subject to an action brought under any of these or future laws. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Among the types of legislation currently being considered at the federal and state levels are consumer laws regulating for the use of certain types of software applications or downloads and the use of &#147;cookies.&#148; These proposed laws are intended to target specific types of software applications often referred to as &#147;spyware,&#148; &#147;invasiveware&#148; or &#147;adware,&#148; and may also cover certain applications currently used in the online advertising industry to serve and distribute advertisements. In addition, the FTC has sought inquiry regarding the implementation of a &#147;do-not-track&#148; requirement. Federal legislation is also expected to be introduced that would regulate &#147;online behavioral advertising&#148; practices. If passed, these laws would impose new obligations for companies that use such software applications or technologies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#147;Act&#148;), and the regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission under Title II of the Act, may impose federal licensing, reporting and other regulatory obligations on the Company. To the extent we contract with and use the networks of voice over IP service providers, new legislation or FCC regulation in this area could restrict our business, prevent us from offering service or increase our cost of doing business. There are an increasing number of regulations and rulings that specifically address access to commerce and communications services on the Internet, including IP telephony. We are unable to predict the impact, if any that future legislation, legal decisions or regulations concerning voice services offered via the Internet may have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The U.S. Congress, the FCC, state legislatures or state agencies may target, among other things, access or settlement charges, imposing taxes related to Internet communications, imposing tariffs or other regulations based on encryption concerns, or the characteristics and quality of products and services that we may offer. Any new laws or regulations concerning these or other areas of our business could restrict our growth or increase our cost of doing business. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The FCC has initiated a proceeding regarding the regulation of broadband services. The increasing growth of the broadband IP telephony market and popularity of broadband IP telephony products and services heighten the risk that the FCC or other legislative bodies will seek to regulate broadband IP telephony and the Internet. In addition, large, established telecommunication companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of the broadband IP telephony market, which may be contrary to our interests. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; There is risk that a regulatory agency will require us to conform to rules that are unsuitable for IP communications technologies or rules that cannot be complied with due to the nature and efficiencies of IP routing, or are unnecessary or unreasonable in light of the manner in which we offer voice-related services such as call recording and pay-for-call services to our customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Federal and state telemarketing laws including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Laws affecting telephone call recording and data protection, such as consent and personal data statutes. Under the federal Wiretap Act, at least one party taking part in a call must be notified if the call is being recorded. Under this law, and most state laws, there is nothing illegal about one of the parties to a telephone call recording the conversation. However, several states (i.e., California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington) require that all parties consent when one party wants to record a telephone conversation. The telephone recording laws in other states, like federal law, require only one party to be aware of the recording. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act may require that we undertake material modifications to its platforms and processes to permit wiretapping and other access for law enforcement personnel. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Under various Orders of the Federal Communications Commission, including its Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket Number WC 04-36, dated June 27, 2006, we may be required to make material retroactive and prospective contributions to funds intended to support Universal Service, Telecommunications Relay Service, Local Number Portability, the North American Numbering Plan and the budget of the Federal Communications Commission. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Laws in most states of the United States of America may require registration or licensing of one or more of our subsidiaries, and may impose additional taxes, fees or telecommunications surcharges on the provision of our services which we may not be able to pass through to customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our international operations may expose us to telecommunications regulations in the countries where we are operating and these regulations could negatively affect the viability of our business. In addition, there are a large number of federal and state legislative proposals related to our business. It is not possible to predict whether, or when, such legislation might be adopted, and certain proposals, if adopted, could result in a decrease in user registrations and revenue. 

We comply with existing law and intend to fully comply with all future laws and regulations that may govern our industry. We have dedicated internal resources and hired outside professionals who regularly establish, review and maintain policies and procedures to reduce the risk of noncompliance. Nevertheless, these laws may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liability, if we failed to fully comply, even if such failure was unintentional. 

The acquisition of Internet domains generally is governed by Internet regulatory bodies, predominantly the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The regulation of Internet domains in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. ICANN and other regulatory bodies could establish 

&#160;

additional requirements for previously owned Internet domains or modify the requirements for Internet domains. Furthermore, ICANN has and will likely continue to make changes to the scope of domain products available to the marketplace that could have an impact on the competition for domain. 

Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could interfere with our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries or expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. Our continued international expansion also subjects us to increased foreign currency exchange rate risks and will require additional management attention and resources. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our international expansion. 

We post a privacy policy which describes our practices concerning the use and disclosure of any user data collected or submitted via our web sites. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or other federal, state or international privacy or direct marketing laws and regulations could result in governmental or regulatory investigations that could potentially harm our businesses, operational results and overall financial condition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of 375 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relationships to be positive. If we were unable to retain our key employees or we were unable to maintain adequate staffing of qualified employees, particularly during peak sales seasons, our business would be adversely affected.
