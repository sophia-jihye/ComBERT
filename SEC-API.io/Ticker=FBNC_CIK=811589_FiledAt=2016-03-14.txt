 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

General Description 

&#160;

First Bancorp (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a bank holding company. Our principal activity is the ownership and operation of First Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a state-chartered bank with its main office in Southern Pines, North Carolina. The Company is also the parent to a series of statutory business trusts organized under the laws of the State of Delaware that were created for the purpose of issuing trust preferred debt securities. Our outstanding debt associated with these trusts was $46.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in North Carolina on December 8, 1983, as Montgomery Bancorp, for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank through a stock-for-stock exchange. On December 31, 1986, the Company changed its name to First Bancorp to conform its name to the name of the Bank, which had changed its name from Bank of Montgomery to First Bank in 1985.

&#160;

The Bank was organized in 1934 and began banking operations in 1935 as the Bank of Montgomery, named for the county in which it operated. Until September 2013, the Bank&#8217;s main office was in Troy, North Carolina, located in the center of Montgomery County. In September 2013, the Company and the Bank moved their main offices approximately 45 miles to Southern Pines, North Carolina, in Moore County. As of December 31, 2015, we conducted business from 88 branches covering a geographical area from Florence, South Carolina to the southeast, to Wilmington, North Carolina to the east, to Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina to the northeast, to Salem, Virginia to the north, to Abingdon, Virginia to the northwest, and to Asheville, North Carolina to the west. We also have loan production offices in Greenville, North Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina. Of the Bank&#8217;s 88 branches, 75 branches are in North Carolina, six branches are in South Carolina and seven branches are in Virginia (where we operate under the name &#8220;First Bank of Virginia&#8221;). Ranked by assets, the Bank was the sixth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had two wholly owned subsidiaries, First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (&#8220;First Bank Insurance&#8221;) and First Troy SPE, LLC. First Bank Insurance&#8217;s primary business activity is the placement of property and casualty insurance coverage. First Troy SPE, LLC, which was organized in December 2009, is a holding entity for certain foreclosed properties.

&#160;

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 300 SW Broad Street, Southern Pines, North Carolina, 28387, and our telephone number is (910) 246-2500. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; in this annual report on Form 10-K shall mean collectively First Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.

&#160;

General Business 

&#160;

We engage in a full range of banking activities, with the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans being our most basic activities. We offer deposit products such as checking, savings, and money market accounts, as well as time deposits, including various types of certificates of deposits (CDs) and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). We provide loans for a wide range of consumer and commercial purposes, including loans for business, agriculture, real estate, personal uses, home improvement and automobiles. We also offer credit cards, debit cards, letters of credit, safe deposit box rentals and electronic funds transfer services, including wire transfers. In addition, we offer internet banking, mobile banking, cash management and bank-by-phone capabilities to our customers, and are affiliated with ATM networks that give our customers access to 67,000 ATMs, with no surcharge fee. We also offer a mobile check deposit feature for our mobile banking customers that allows them to securely deposit checks via their smartphone. For our business customers, we offer remote deposit capture, which provides them with a method to electronically transmit checks received from customers into their bank account without having to visit a branch. We are a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), which gives our customers the ability to obtain FDIC insurance on deposits of up to $50 million, while continuing to work directly with their local First Bank branch.

&#160;

Because the majority of our customers are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses located in the counties we serve, management does not believe that the loss of a single customer or group of customers would have a material adverse impact on the Bank. There are no seasonal factors that tend to have any material effect on the Bank&#8217;s business, and we do not rely on foreign sources of funds or income. Because we operate primarily within North Carolina, southwestern Virginia and northeastern South Carolina, the economic conditions of these areas could have a material impact on the Company. See additional discussion below in the section entitled &#8220;Territory Served and Competition.&#8221;

&#160;

Beginning in 1999, First Bank Insurance began offering non-FDIC insured investment and insurance products, including mutual funds, annuities, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and company retirement plans, as well as financial planning services (the &#8220;investments division&#8221;). In May 2001, First Bank Insurance added to its product line when it acquired two insurance agencies that specialized in the placement of property and casualty insurance. In October 2003, the &#8220;investments division&#8221; of First Bank Insurance became a part of the Bank and the primary activity of First Bank Insurance became the placement of property and casualty insurance products. On January 1, 2016, First Bank Insurance acquired Bankingport, Inc., an insurance agency based in Sanford, North Carolina, which provides First Bank Insurance with economies of scale and a larger platform for leveraging insurance services throughout the First Bank branch network.

&#160;

First Bancorp Capital Trust II and First Bancorp Capital Trust III were organized in December 2003 for the purpose of issuing $20.6 million in debt securities ($10.3 million was issued from each trust). These borrowings are due on January 23, 2034 and are also structured as trust preferred capital securities in order to qualify as regulatory capital. These debt securities are callable by the Company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on January 23, 2009. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a weighted average rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70%.

&#160;

First Bancorp Capital Trust IV was organized in April 2006 for the purpose of issuing $25.8 million in debt securities. These borrowings are due on June 15, 2036 and are also structured as trust preferred capital 

5&#160;

&#160;

securities that qualify as regulatory capital. These debt securities are callable by the Company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on June 15, 2011. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.39%.

&#160; 

Territory Served and Competition 

&#160;

Our headquarters are located in Southern Pines, Moore County, North Carolina, where we also have our highest concentration of deposits. At the end of 2015, we served primarily the south central region (sometimes called the Piedmont region), the central mountain region and the eastern coastal region of North Carolina, with additional operations in northeastern South Carolina and southwestern Virginia. The following table presents, for each county where we operated as of December 31, 2015, the number of bank branches operated by the Company within the county, the approximate amount of deposits with the Company in the county as of December 31, 2015, our approximate deposit market share at June 30, 2015, and the number of bank competitors located in the county at June 30, 2015.

6&#160;

&#160;

Our branches and facilities are primarily located in small communities whose economies are based primarily on services, manufacturing and light industry. Although our market is predominantly small communities and rural areas, the market area is not dependent on agriculture. Textiles, furniture, mobile homes, electronics, plastic and metal fabrication, forest products, food products, and chicken hatcheries are among the leading manufacturing industries in the trade area. Leading producers of lumber and rugs are located in Montgomery County, North Carolina. The Pinehurst area within Moore County, North Carolina, is a widely known golf resort and retirement area. The High Point, North Carolina, area is widely known for its furniture market. New Hanover and Brunswick Counties, located in the southeastern coastal region of North Carolina, are popular with tourists and have significant retirement populations. Buncombe County, located in the western region of North Carolina, is a highly diverse area with industries in manufacturing, service, and tourism. Additionally, several of the communities served by the Company are &#8220;bedroom&#8221; communities of large cities like Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, while several branches are located in medium-sized cities such as Albemarle, Asheboro, Fayetteville, Jacksonville, High Point, Southern Pines and Sanford. We also have branches in small communities such as Bennett, Polkton, Vass, and Harmony.

&#160;

In addition to the branches shown above, in the second half of 2013, we established a loan production office in Greenville, North Carolina, and in the second half of 2015, we established a loan production office in Charlotte, North Carolina. In early 2016, in connection with the hiring of five bankers from a local community bank competitor, we established loan production offices in Greensboro and Raleigh, North Carolina. These are new, yet contiguous, markets to our branch footprint, and are consistent with our recent branch expansion strategy of focusing on larger, higher growth markets.

&#160;

In March 2016, we announced we had reached an agreement to exchange our seven bank branches located in Virginia for six North Carolina bank branches of a community bank that is headquartered in Virginia, with a similar amount of loans and deposits. Four of the six branches we expect to assume are in Winston-Salem, with the other two branches being in the Charlotte-metro markets of Mooresville and Huntersville. According to the agreement, it is expected that substantially all deposits and certain loans assigned to the branches will transfer. Currently, our branches in Virginia have approximately $150 million in deposits, while the branches we expect to assume have approximately $130 million in deposits. It is estimated that the amount of loans that will be transferred between the two banks will be up to $175 million. We entered Virginia in 2001 with a branch in Wytheville and had grown that presence to a total of seven branches. The distant proximity to our core market and the opportunity to assume what is essentially a banking franchise in markets where we have recently invested in human capital were the primary factors we considered in entering into the exchange agreement.

&#160;

Approximately 16% of our deposit base is in Moore County. Accordingly, material changes in competition, the economy or population of Moore County could materially impact the Company. No other county comprises more than 10% of our deposit base.

&#160;

We compete in our various market areas with, among others, several large interstate bank holding companies. These large competitors have substantially greater resources than our Company, including broader geographic markets, higher lending limits and the ability to make greater use of large-scale advertising and promotions. A significant number of interstate banking acquisitions have taken place in the past decade, thus further increasing the size and financial resources of some of our competitors, some of which are among the largest bank holding companies in the nation. In many of our markets, we also compete against smaller, local banks. With interest rates on investment securities at historic lows and banks of all sizes attempting to maximize yields on earning assets, the competition for high-quality loans has become intense. Accordingly, loan rates in our markets are under competitive pressure. The pricing competition for deposits has lessened, but at any given time in many of our markets, there are frequently smaller banks offering higher rates on deposits than we are willing to match. This has resulted in our bank losing the deposits of some price-sensitive customers, which has been primarily responsible for the declines in our time deposit accounts that are discussed below in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Moore County, which as noted above comprises a disproportionate share of our deposits, is a particularly competitive market, with at least ten other financial institutions having a physical presence within the county.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

We compete not only against banking organizations, but also against a wide range of financial service providers, including federally and state-chartered savings and loan institutions, credit unions, investment and brokerage firms and small-loan or consumer finance companies. One of the credit unions in our market area is among the largest in the nation. Competition among financial institutions of all types is virtually unlimited with respect to legal ability and authority to provide most financial services. We also experience competition from internet banks, particularly in the area of time deposits.

&#160;

Despite the competitive market, we believe we have certain advantages over our competition in the areas we serve. We are large enough to be able to more easily absorb higher costs being experienced in the banking industry, particularly regulatory costs and technology costs, than the smaller banks we compete with. We are also able to originate significantly larger loans than many of our smaller bank competitors. At the same time, we attempt to maintain a banking culture associated with smaller banks &#8211; a culture that has a personal and local flavor that appeals to many retail and small business customers. Specifically, we seek to maintain a distinct local identity in each of the communities we serve and we actively sponsor and participate in local civic affairs. Most lending and other customer-related business decisions can be made without the delays often associated with larger institutions. Additionally, employment of local managers and personnel in various offices and low turnover of personnel enable us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with individual and corporate customers.

&#160;

Lending Policy and Procedures 

&#160;

Conservative lending policies and procedures and appropriate underwriting standards are high priorities of the Bank. Loans are approved under our written loan policy, which provides that lending officers, principally branch managers, have authority to approve loans of various amounts up to $350,000 with lending limits varying depending upon the experience of the lending officer and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. We have seven senior lending officers that have authority to approve secured loans up to $500,000 and each of our three Regional Presidents has authority to approve secured loans up to $1,000,000. Loans up to $3,000,000 are approved by the Bank&#8217;s Regional Credit Officers through our Credit Administration Department. The Bank&#8217;s Chief Credit Officer has authority to approve loans up to $6,000,000, while the Chief Credit Officer and the Bank&#8217;s President have joint authority to approve loans up to $8,000,000. The Bank&#8217;s board of directors maintains loan authority up to the Bank&#8217;s in-house limit of $25,000,000 and generally approves loans through its Executive Loan Committee. All lending authorities are based on the borrower&#8217;s Total Credit Exposure (&#8220;TCE&#8221;), which is an aggregate of the Bank&#8217;s lending relationship to the borrower. TCE is based on the borrower&#8217;s total credit exposure with the Bank either directly or indirectly through loan guarantees or other borrowing entities related to the borrower through control or ownership.

&#160;

The Executive Loan Committee reviews and approves loans that exceed management&#8217;s lending authority, loans to executive officers, directors, and their affiliates and, in certain instances, other types of loans. New credit extensions are reviewed daily by our senior management and the Credit Administration Department.

&#160;

We continually monitor our loan portfolio to identify areas of concern and to enable us to take corrective action. Lending and credit administration officers and the board of directors meet periodically to review past due loans and portfolio quality, while assuring that the Bank is appropriately meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves. Individual lending officers are responsible for monitoring any changes in the financial status of borrowers and pursuing collection of early-stage past due amounts. For certain types of loans that exceed our established parameters of past due status, the Bank&#8217;s Asset Resolution Group assumes the management of the loan, and in some cases we engage a third-party firm to assist in collection efforts.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

The Bank has an internal Loan Review Department that conducts on-going and targeted reviews of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio and assesses the Bank&#8217;s adherence to loan policies, risk grading and accrual policies. Reports are generated for management based on these activities and findings are used to adjust risk grades as deemed appropriate. In addition, these reports are shared with the Company&#8217;s board of directors. The Loan Review Department also provides training assistance to the Bank&#8217;s Training and Credit Administration departments.

&#160;

To further assess the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio and as a secondary review of the Bank&#8217;s Loan Review Department, we also contract with an independent consulting firm to review new loan originations meeting certain criteria, as well as to assign risk grades to existing credits meeting certain thresholds. The consulting firm&#8217;s observations, comments, and risk grades, including variances with the Bank&#8217;s risk grades, are shared with the audit committee of the Company&#8217;s board of directors and are considered by management in setting Bank policy, as well as in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. For additional information, see &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience&#8221; under Item 7 below.

&#160; 

Investment Policy and Procedures 

&#160;

We have adopted an investment policy designed to maximize our income from funds not needed to meet loan demand, in a manner consistent with appropriate liquidity and risk objectives. Pursuant to this policy, we may invest in federal, state and municipal obligations, federal agency obligations, public housing authority bonds, industrial development revenue bonds, Federal Home Loan Bank bonds, Fannie Mae bonds, Government National Mortgage Association bonds, Freddie Mac bonds, Small Business Administration bonds, and, to a limited extent, corporate bonds. We may also invest up to $60 million in time deposits with other financial institutions. Time deposit purchases from any one financial institution exceeding FDIC insurance coverage limits are evaluated as a corporate bond and are subject to the same due diligence requirements as corporate bonds (described below).

&#160;

In making investment decisions, we do not solely rely on credit ratings to determine the credit-worthiness of an issuer of securities, but we use credit ratings in conjunction with other information when performing due diligence prior to the purchase of a security. Securities that are not rated investment grade will not be purchased. Securities rated below Moody&#8217;s BAA or Standard and Poor&#8217;s BBB generally will not be purchased. Securities rated below A are periodically reviewed for credit-worthiness. We may purchase non-rated municipal bonds only if such bonds are in our general market area and we determine these bonds have a credit risk no greater than the minimum ratings referred to above. Industrial development authority bonds, which normally are not rated, are purchased only if they are judged to possess a high degree of credit soundness to assure reasonably prompt sale at a fair value. We are also authorized by our board of directors to invest a portion of our securities portfolio in high quality corporate bonds, with the amount of such bonds not to exceed 15% of the entire securities portfolio. Prior to purchasing a corporate bond, the Company&#8217;s management performs due diligence on the issuer of the bond, and the purchase is not made unless we believe that the purchase of the bond bears no more risk to the Company than would an unsecured loan to the same company.

&#160;

Our Chief Investment Officer implements the investment policy, monitors the investment portfolio, recommends portfolio strategies and reports to the Company&#8217;s Investment Committee. The Investment Committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review investment activity and to assess the overall position of the securities portfolio. The Investment Committee compares our securities portfolio with portfolios of other companies of comparable size. In addition, reports of all purchases, sales, issuer calls, net profits or losses and market appreciation or depreciation of the securities portfolio are reviewed by our board of directors. Once a quarter, our interest rate risk exposure is evaluated by our board of directors. Each year, the written investment policy is approved by the board of directors.

&#160;

&#160;

Mergers and Acquisitions 

&#160; 

As part of our operations, we have pursued an acquisition strategy over the years to augment our internal growth. We regularly evaluate the potential acquisition of, or merger with, various financial institutions. Our acquisitions have generally fallen into one of three categories - 1) an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof within a market in which we operate, 2) an acquisition of a financial institution or branch thereof in a market contiguous or nearly contiguous to a market in which we operate, or 3) an acquisition of a company that has products or services that we do not currently offer. Historically, we have paid for our acquisitions with cash and/or common stock and any operating income or loss has been fully borne by the Company beginning on the closing date of the acquisition.

&#160;

In 2009, FDIC-assisted acquisitions began to occur frequently as banking regulators closed problem banks. In FDIC-assisted transactions, the acquiring bank often does not pay any consideration for the failed bank, and in some cases receives cash from the FDIC as part of the transaction. In addition, the acquiring bank usually enters into one or more loss share agreements with the FDIC, which affords the acquiring bank significant loss protection. As discussed below, we completed FDIC-assisted transactions in 2009 and 2011.

&#160;

We believe that we can enhance our earnings by pursuing these types of acquisition opportunities through any combination or all of the following: 1) achieving cost efficiencies, 2) enhancing the acquiree&#8217;s earnings or gaining new customers by introducing a more successful banking model with more products and services to the acquiree&#8217;s market base, 3) increasing customer satisfaction or gaining new customers by providing more locations for the convenience of customers, and 4) leveraging the customer base by offering new products and services. There is also the possibility, especially in a FDIC-assisted transaction, to record a gain on the acquisition date arising from the difference between the purchase price and the acquisition date fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.

&#160;

Since becoming a public company in 1987, we have completed numerous acquisitions in each of the three categories described above. We have completed several whole-bank traditional acquisitions in our existing and contiguous markets; we have purchased numerous bank branches from other banks (both in existing market areas and in contiguous/nearly contiguous markets) and we have acquired several insurance agencies, which has provided us with the ability to offer property and casualty insurance coverage.

&#160;

In addition to the traditional acquisitions discussed above, in both 2009 and 2011 we acquired the operations of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. On June 19, 2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank in a FDIC-assisted transaction. Cooperative Bank operated through twenty-one branches in North Carolina and three branches in South Carolina in the same markets in which the Bank was already operating, as well as in several new, mostly contiguous markets. In connection with the acquisition, the Bank assumed assets with a book value of $959 million, including $829 million in loans and $706 million in deposits. See the Company&#8217;s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on this acquisition.

&#160;

On January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC-assisted transaction. The Bank of Asheville operated through five branches in or near Asheville, North Carolina. This market was a new market for the Bank. In connection with the acquisition, the Bank assumed assets with a book value of $190 million, including $154 million in loans and $192 million in deposits. See the Company&#8217;s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on this acquisition.

&#160;

The following paragraphs describe the other acquisitions that we have completed in the past three years.

&#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

On March 22, 2013, we completed the purchase of two branches from Four Oaks Bank &#38; Trust Company located in Southern Pines and Rockingham, North Carolina. We acquired $57 million in deposits and $16 million in loans in the acquisition. We purchased the Rockingham branch building, but did not purchase the Southern Pines branch building and instead transferred the acquired accounts to one of the Company&#8217;s nearby existing branches.

&#160;

In January 2016, we acquired Bankingport, Inc., an insurance agency based in Sanford, North Carolina. Although not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated operations, the acquisition provided us with the opportunity to enhance our product offerings, as well as expand our insurance agency operations into a significant banking market for our Company. Also this acquisition provides us a larger platform for leveraging insurance services throughout our bank branch network.

&#160;

As noted previously, in March 2016, we announced we had reached an agreement to exchange our seven bank branches located in Virginia for six North Carolina bank branches of a community bank that is headquartered in Virginia, with a similar amount of loans and deposits. Four of the six branches we expect to assume are in Winston-Salem, with the other two branches being in the Charlotte-metro markets of Mooresville and Huntersville. According to the agreement, it is expected that substantially all deposits and certain loans assigned to the branches will transfer. Currently, our branches in Virginia have approximately $150 million in deposits, while the branches we expect to assume have approximately $130 million in deposits. It is estimated that the amount of loans that will be transferred between the two banks will be up to $175 million. We entered Virginia in 2001 with a branch in Wytheville and had grown that presence to a total of seven branches. The distant proximity to our core market and the opportunity to assume what is essentially a banking franchise in markets where we have recently invested in human capital were the primary factors we considered in entering into the exchange agreement.

&#160;

There are many factors that we consider when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates (including FDIC-assisted transactions) with a few of the more significant factors being projected impact on earnings per share, projected impact on capital, and projected impact on book value and tangible book value. Significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate, estimated credit and other losses to be incurred, the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized, and the interest rate earned/lost on the cash received/paid. In addition to these primary factors, we also consider other factors including (but not limited to) marketplace acquisition statistics, location of the candidate in relation to our expansion strategy, market growth potential, management of the candidate, potential integration issues (including corporate culture), and the size of the acquisition candidate.

&#160;

We plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that could potentially benefit the Company and its shareholders. These opportunities may include acquisitions that do not fit the categories discussed above.

&#160;

For a further discussion of recent acquisition activity, see &#8220;Merger and Acquisition Activity&#8221; under Item 7 below.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 783 full-time and 57 part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

As a bank holding company, we are subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;) and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;). The Bank is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) and the Commissioner. Until April 22, 2015, the Bank was regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). Effective April 22, 2015, the Bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System, and therefore, the FRB replaced the FDIC as the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. For additional information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

&#160; 

11&#160;

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation of the Company 

&#160;

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is also regulated by the Commissioner under the North Carolina Bank Holding Company Act of 1984.

&#160;

A bank holding company is required to file quarterly reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). It is also subject to examination by the FRB and is required to obtain FRB approval prior to making certain acquisitions of other institutions or voting securities. The FRB requires the Company to maintain certain levels of capital - see &#8220;Capital Resources and Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; under Item 7 below. The FRB also has the authority to take enforcement action against any bank holding company that commits any unsafe or unsound practice, or violates certain laws, regulations or conditions imposed in writing by the FRB. The FRB generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend that would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements which might adversely affect a bank holding company&#8217;s financial position. Under the FRB policy, a bank holding company is not permitted to continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.

&#160;

The Commissioner is empowered to regulate certain acquisitions of North Carolina banks and bank holding companies, issue cease and desist orders for violations of North Carolina banking laws, and promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of the North Carolina Bank Holding Company Act of 1984.

&#160;

Regulatory authorities have cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. Those authorities may compel holding companies to invest additional capital into banking subsidiaries upon acquisitions or in the event of significant loan losses or rapid growth of loans or deposits.

&#160;

The United States Congress and the North Carolina General Assembly have periodically considered and adopted legislation that has impacted the Company.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation of the Bank 

&#160;

Federal banking regulations applicable to all depository financial institutions, among other things: (i) provide federal bank regulatory agencies with powers to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices; (ii) restrict preferential loans by banks to &#8220;insiders&#8221; of banks; (iii) require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and (iv) bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions.

&#160;

As a state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the North Carolina banking statutes and to regulation by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has a wide range of regulatory authority over the activities and operations of the Bank, and the Commissioner&#8217;s staff conducts periodic examinations of the Bank and its affiliates to ensure compliance with state banking regulations and to assess the safety and soundness of the Bank. Among other things, the Commissioner regulates the merger and consolidation of state-chartered banks, the payment of dividends, loans to officers and directors, recordkeeping, types and amounts of loans and investments, and the establishment of branches. The Commissioner also has cease and desist powers over state-chartered banks for violations of state banking laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound conduct that is likely to jeopardize the interest of depositors.

&#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to legal limitations under North Carolina law. In addition, under FRB regulations, a dividend cannot be paid by the Bank if it would be less than well-capitalized after the dividend. The FRB may also prevent the payment of a dividend by the Bank if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent on the dividends paid to the Company by the Bank.

&#160;

The FRB is authorized to approve conversions, mergers, consolidations and assumptions of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions, and to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions if the resulting, continuing, or assumed bank is an insured member bank. The FRB also conducts periodic examinations of the Bank to assess its safety and soundness and its compliance with banking laws and regulations, and it has the power to implement changes to, or restrictions on, the Bank&#8217;s operations if it finds that a violation is occurring or is threatened. In addition, the FRB monitors the Bank&#8217;s compliance with several banking statutes, such as the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.

&#160;

Small Business Lending Fund 

&#160;

In December 2010, the U.S. Treasury announced the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) program, which was established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The SBLF was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks at favorable rates.

&#160;

Interested financial institutions were required to submit an application and a small business lending plan. Less than half of the financial institutions that applied for the SBLF were approved. We were one of the institutions approved, and on September 1, 2011, we completed the sale of $63.5 million of Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury under the SBLF (&#8220;SBLF stock&#8221;). Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received 63,500 shares of Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $63.5 million. The initial dividend rate on SBLF stock was 5%. The terms of the stock provided that our dividend rate could decrease to as low as 1% for a period of time depending on our success in meeting certain loan growth targets to small businesses. Based on our increases in small business lending, we achieved the minimal dividend rate of 1% as of March 31, 2013. The increase in the amount of small business loans remained at a level corresponding to a 1% dividend rate at September 30, 2013, at which point the terms of the preferred stock provided that the dividend rate remained fixed until March 1, 2016. On March 1, 2016, the contractual dividend rate was set to increase to 9%. The Company redeemed $32 million of the SBLF stock in June 2015 and the remaining $31.5 million in October 2015, which ended our participation in the SBLF. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

&#160;

FDIC Insurance 

&#160;

As a member of the FDIC, the Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount, which is currently $250,000 per depositor. For this protection, each member bank pays a quarterly statutory assessment (which is based on average total assets less average tangible equity) and is subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC.

&#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

We recognized approximately $2.4 million, $4.0 million, and $2.8 million in FDIC insurance expense in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. FDIC insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds.

&#160; 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 

&#160;

The most significant recent legislative and regulatory developments impacting the Company are 1) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and 2) Basel III, which are discussed below.

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes including, among other things,

&#183; enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; &#183; increased capital and liquidity requirements; &#183; increased regulatory examination fees; &#183; specific provisions designed to improve supervision and safety and soundness by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities. &#160;

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that will be enforced by new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the FRB, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The following description briefly summarizes aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that could impact the Company, both currently and prospectively.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits, which was an increase from the previous limit of $100,000. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) will be calculated. Under the amendments, which became effective on April 1, 2011, the FDIC assessment base is no longer the institution&#8217;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds by September 30, 2020.

&#160; 

Trust Preferred Securities. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies from including in their regulatory Tier I capital hybrid debt and equity securities issued on or after May 19, 2010. Among the hybrid debt and equity securities included in this prohibition are trust preferred securities, which we have issued in the past in order to raise additional Tier I capital and otherwise improve our regulatory capital ratios. Although we may continue to include our existing trust preferred securities as Tier I capital because they were issued prior to May 18, 2010, the prohibition on the use of these securities as Tier I capital may limit our ability to raise capital in the future.

&#160;

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB will have authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.

&#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower's ability to repay. Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require banks to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a &#8220;reasonable ability to repay&#8221; test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; in which case a rebuttable presumption exists that the creditor extending the loan has satisfied the reasonable ability to repay test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower's principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans for a longer period of time. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers&#8217; ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorney generals to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Compliance with any such new regulations established by the CFPB and/or states could reduce our revenue, increase our cost of operations, and limit our ability to expand into certain products and services.

&#160;

Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. Effective October 1, 2011, the FRB set new caps on interchange fees at $0.21 per transaction, plus an additional five basis-point charge per transaction to help cover fraud losses. An additional $0.01 per transaction is allowed if certain fraud-monitoring controls are in place. While we are not directly subject to these rules so long as our assets do not exceed $10 billion, our activities as a debit card issuer may nevertheless be indirectly impacted by the change in the applicable debit card market caused by these regulations, which may require us to match any new lower fee structure implemented by larger financial institutions in order to remain competitive in the future. Nevertheless, to date, the Company has not noted any significant indirect negative effects of the interchange fee caps that are applicable to the larger financial institutions.

&#160;

Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. These new standards are to be no less strict than existing regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may, in fact, become higher once the agencies promulgate the new standards. Compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations. See discussion of the new capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies under &#8220;Recent Amendments to Regulatory Capital Requirement under Basel III&#8221; below.

&#160;

15&#160;

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.

&#160;

Transactions with Insiders. The Dodd-Frank Act expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also places restrictions on certain asset sales to and from an insider of an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, receive the approval of the institution&#8217;s board of directors.

&#160;

Enhanced Lending Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower. Federal banking law limits a national bank&#8217;s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons to an amount that does not exceed certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. It also will eventually prohibit state-chartered banks, including the Bank, from engaging in derivative transactions unless the state lending limit laws take into account credit exposure to such transactions.

&#160;

Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act:

&#183; grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; &#183; enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; &#183; requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt clawback policies for incentive-based compensation plans applicable to executive officers; and &#183; provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as directors and require such companies to include such nominees in its proxy materials. &#160;

The Volcker Rule . Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as &#8220;banking entities&#8221;) from engaging in two types of activities: &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as &#8220;covered funds.&#8221; Proprietary trading is, in general, trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity's own account. Funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition are those not required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission because they have only accredited investors or no more than 100 investors. In December 2013, our primary federal regulator, the FRB, together with other federal banking agencies, the FEDIC, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2015, the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds.

&#160;

Many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to implementation over the course of several years. While we do not currently expect the final requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act to have a material adverse impact on the Company, we do expect them to negatively impact our profitability, require changes to certain of our business practices, including limitations on fee income opportunities, and impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements upon the Company. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements.

&#160;

16&#160;

&#160;

Recent Amendments to Regulatory Capital Requirement under Basel III 

&#160;

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved amendments to their regulatory capital rules to conform U.S. regulatory capital rules with the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; The revisions establish new higher capital ratio requirements, narrow the definitions of capital, impose new operating restrictions on banking organizations with insufficient capital buffers and increase the risk weighting of certain assets. The new capital requirements apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies with more than $500 million in assets, such as the Company and the Bank, and all savings and loan holding companies regardless of asset size. The rules became effective for institutions with assets over $250 billion and internationally active institutions in January 2014 and became effective for all other institutions in January 2015. The following discussion summarizes the changes we believe are most likely to affect the Company and the Bank.

&#160;

&#183; New and Increased Capital Requirements. The regulations establish a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier I Capital&#8221; consisting of common stock and related surplus, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries. Unlike the current rules which exclude unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from regulatory capital, the amended rules generally require accumulated other comprehensive income to flow through to regulatory capital unless a one-time, irrevocable opt-out election is made in the first regulatory reporting period under the new rule. Depository institutions and their holding companies were required to maintain Common Equity Tier I Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets starting in 2015. &#160;

The regulations also increase the required ratio of Tier I Capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% effective January 1, 2015. Tier I Capital consists of Common Equity Tier I Capital plus Additional Tier I Capital which includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock (other than cumulative preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program or the Small Business Lending Fund) no longer qualifies as Additional Tier I Capital. Trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may continue to be included in Tier I Capital, but these instruments will be phased out over 10 years beginning in 2016 for all other banking organizations. These non-qualified capital instruments, however, may be included in Tier II Capital which could also include qualifying subordinated debt.

&#160;

&#183; Changes to Prompt Corrective Action Capital Categories. The Prompt Corrective Action rules, effective January 1, 2015, incorporated the Common Equity Tier I Capital requirement and raised the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is now required to have at least an 8% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 6% Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 4.5% Common Equity Tier I Risk Based Capital Ratio and a 4% Tier I Leverage Ratio. To be well capitalized, a banking organization is required to have at least a 10% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, an 8% Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 6.5% Common Equity Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio and a 5% Tier I Leverage Ratio. &#160;

&#183; Capital Buffer Requirement. In addition to increased capital requirements, depository institutions and their holding companies will be required to maintain a capital buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over a four-year period beginning in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% Common Equity Tier I Capital, 8.5% Tier I Capital and 10.5% Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis. The capital buffer requirement for the Company begins to be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. &#160;

17&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Additional Deductions from Capital. Banking organizations are required to deduct goodwill and certain other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, from Common Equity Tier I Capital. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carrybacks will continue to be deducted. Deferred tax assets that can be realized through NOL carrybacks are now not deducted but will be subject to 100% risk weighting. Defined benefit pension fund assets, net of any associated deferred tax liability, are now deducted from Common Equity Tier I Capital unless the banking organization has unrestricted and unfettered access to such assets. Reciprocal cross-holdings of capital instruments in any other financial institutions are now deducted from capital, not just holdings in other depository institutions. For this purpose, financial institutions are broadly defined to include securities and commodities firms, hedge and private equity funds and non-depository lenders. Banking organizations are now also required to deduct non-significant investments (less than 10% of outstanding stock) in other financial institutions to the extent these exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier I Capital subject to a 15% of Common Equity Tier I Capital cap. Greater than 10% investments must be deducted if they exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier I Capital. If the aggregate amount of certain items excluded from capital deduction due to a 10% threshold exceeds 17.65% of Common Equity Tier I Capital, the excess must be deducted. &#160;

&#183; Changes in Risk-Weightings. The amended regulations continue to follow the current capital rules which assign a 50% risk-weighting to &#8220;qualifying mortgage loans&#8221; which generally consist of residential first mortgages with an 80% loan-to-value ratio (or which carry mortgage insurance that reduces the bank&#8217;s exposure to 80%) that are not more than 90 days past due. All other mortgage loans continue to have a 100% risk weight. The revised regulations apply a 250% risk-weighting to mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets that cannot be realized through NOL carrybacks and investments in the capital instruments of other financial institutions that are not deducted from capital. The revised regulations also created a new 150% risk-weighting category for nonaccrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due and for &#8220;high volatility commercial real estate loans,&#8221; which are credit facilities for the acquisition, construction or development of real property other than for certain community development projects, agricultural land and one- to four-family residential properties or commercial real projects where: (i) the loan-to-value ratio is not in excess of interagency real estate lending standards; and (ii) the borrower has contributed capital equal to not less than 15% of the real estate&#8217;s &#8220;as completed&#8221; value before the loan was made. &#160;

The final rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015.

&#160;

We believe that both the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the fully phased-in final rules.

&#160;

See &#8220;Capital Resources and Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; under Item 7 below for further discussion of regulatory capital requirements.

18&#160;

&#160;

Liquidity Requirements 

&#160;

Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. Liquidity risk management has become increasingly important since the financial crisis. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#8217;s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.

&#160;

In September 2014, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations, neither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank. The federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR or addressed the scope of bank organizations to which it will apply.

&#160; 

Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity 

&#160;

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. First Bancorp has multiple Information Security Programs that reflect the requirements of this guidance. If, however, we fail to observe the regulatory guidance in the future, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
