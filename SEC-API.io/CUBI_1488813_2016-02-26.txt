 Item 1. Business 

Customers Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221; or &#8220;Customers Bancorp&#8221;) is a bank holding company engaged in banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, Customers Bank (&#8220;Customers Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), collectively referred to as "Customers" herein. Customers Bancorp has made certain equity investments through its wholly owned subsidiaries CB Green Ventures Pte Ltd. and CUBI India Ventures Pte Ltd. 

Business Summary 

Customers Bancorp, through its wholly owned subsidiary Customers Bank, provides financial products and services to small and middle market businesses, not-for-profits, and consumers through its branches and offices in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Bucks, Berks, Chester, Delaware and Philadelphia Counties), Rye Brook, Melville and New York, New York (Westchester, Suffolk and New York Counties), Hamilton, New Jersey (Mercer County), Providence, Rhode Island (Providence County), Portsmouth, New Hampshire (Rockingham County) and Boston, Massachusetts (Suffolk County). Customers Bank also provides liquidity to the mortgage market nationwide through the operation of its loans to mortgage banking companies. At December 31, 2015, Customers had total assets of $8.4 billion , including loans, net of the allowance for loan losses (including held-for-sale loans) of $7.2 billion , total deposits of $5.9 billion , and shareholders&#8217; equity of $0.6 billion . 

Customers' strategic plan is to become a leading regional bank holding company through organic growth and value-added acquisitions. Customers differentiates itself from its competitors through its focus on exceptional customer service supported by state of the art technology. The primary customers of Customers Bank are privately held businesses, business customers, not-for-profit organizations, and consumers. Customers Bank also focuses on certain low-cost specialty lending areas such as multi-family/commercial real estate lending and lending to mortgage banking businesses. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities are funded in part by deposits from its branch model, which seeks higher deposit levels per branch than a typical bank, combined with lower branch operating expenses, without sacrificing exceptional customer service. Customers also creates franchise value through its disciplined approach to acquisitions, both in terms of identifying targets and structuring transactions. Enterprise risk management is an important part of the strategies Customers employs. 

Customers also launched BankMobile as a key strategic initiative in January 2015, recognizing the product delivery flexibility demanded by the millennial generation and the low cost of the smart phone delivery channel. BankMobile refers to Customers' efforts to build a full service bank that is accessible to our customers anywhere and anytime through the customer's smartphone or other web-enabled device. BankMobile provides a nationwide deposit-aggregation platform. BankMobile focuses on the aggregation of low-cost deposits and currently offers no fee banking, lines of credits to qualified customers, no overdraft fees, higher than average interest rate on savings, and access to 55,000 (and if the customer makes a monthly direct deposit over 400,000) ATMs across the U.S. Customers believes that by consolidating BankMobile with the Disbursements business to be obtained from Higher One, Inc., with approximately 2.0 million student deposit customers, targeted for second quarter 2016, Customers will be uniquely positioned to become the graduating students "bank for life" and service each graduate's financial needs throughout their life. Successful execution of the BankMobile strategy, including its consolidation with Higher One's Disbursements business, will greatly accelerate BankMobile's ability to achieve profitability. BankMobile's revenues are largely derived from interchange charges paid by the product selling vendor and user based fees for specific activities (such as lost card replacement) and net interest income on assets funded by the aggregated deposits. 

The management team of Customers consists of experienced banking executives led by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Sidhu, who joined Customers in June 2009. Mr. Sidhu brings over 40 years of banking experience, including 20 years as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Sovereign Bancorp. In addition to Mr. Sidhu, a number of the members of the current management team have experience working together at Sovereign with Mr. Sidhu. Many other team members who have joined Customers management team have significant experience helping build and lead other banking organizations. Combined, the Customers management team has significant experience in building a banking organization, completing and integrating mergers and acquisitions, and developing valuable community and business relationships in its core markets.

Executive Summary 

Customers' Markets 

Market Criteria 

Customers looks to grow organically as well as through selective acquisitions in its current and prospective markets. Customers believes that there is significant opportunity to both enhance its presence in its current markets and enter new complementary markets that meet its objectives. Customers focuses on markets that it believes are characterized by some or all of the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Population density; 

&#8226; 

Concentration of business activity; 

&#8226;

&#8226;

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Management experience in the applicable markets. 

Current Markets 

Customers' target market is broadly defined as extending from the greater Washington, D.C. area to Boston, Massachusetts roughly following Interstate 95. As of December 31, 2015, Customers had bank branches or limited purpose offices (&#8220;LPOs&#8221;) in the following locations:

Branch/LPO 

Customers believes its target market has highly attractive demographic, economic and competitive dynamics that are consistent with its objectives and favorable to executing its organic growth and acquisition strategies. 

Prospective Markets 

The organic growth strategy of Customers focuses on expanding market share in its existing and contiguous markets by generating deposits, loan and fee based services through its Concierge Banking&#174; high-touch personalized service supported by state of the art technology for the Bank&#8217;s commercial, consumer, not-for-profit, and specialized lending markets. While Customers has not acquired any banks since 2011, its bank acquisition strategy is focused on undervalued and troubled community banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Virginia and New England, where such acquisitions further Customers' objectives and meet its critical success factors. Customers will also consider other acquisitions that will contribute banking business, such as the pending acquisition of the disbursement business of Higher One, Inc. As Customers evaluates potential acquisition and asset purchase opportunities, it believes there are many banking institutions that continue to face credit challenges, capital constraints and liquidity issues and that lack the scale and management expertise to manage the increasing regulatory burden. 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Experienced and respected management team. &#32;An integral element of the business strategy of Customers is to capitalize on and leverage the prior experience of its executive management team. The management team is led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Sidhu, who is the former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Sovereign Bancorp. In addition to Mr. Sidhu, a number of the members of the current management team of Customers have experience working together at Sovereign with Mr. Sidhu, including Richard Ehst, President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as Warren Taylor, President of BankMobile. During their tenure at Sovereign, these individuals established a track record of producing strong financial results, integrating acquisitions, managing risk, working with regulators and achieving organic growth and expense control. Team leaders Timothy Romig, Regional Chief Lending Officer, Steve Issa, New England Marketing President and Chief Lending Officer, and George Maroulis, Head of Private and Commercial Banking - New York, head the New Jersey and Pennsylvania, New England, and New York commercial lending areas, respectively, with 32, 39, and 24 years of experience, respectively. Ken Keiser, Director of Multi-Family and Investment Commercial Real Estate Lending, leads the commercial real estate and multi-family lending group and brings more than 39 years of experience including oversight of the Mid-Atlantic commercial real estate group at Sovereign. In addition, the residential lending group, which includes mortgage loans to individuals and commercial loans (warehouse facilities) to residential mortgage originators, is led by Glenn Hedde, President of Warehouse Lending who brings more than 25 years of experience in this sector. This team has significant experience in successfully building a banking organization as well as existing valuable community and business relationships in our core markets. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Unique Asset and Deposit Generation Strategies. &#32;Customers focuses on local market lending combined with relatively low-risk specialty lending segments. Local market asset generation provides various types of business lending products and consumer lending products, such as mortgage loans and home equity loans. Customers has also established a multi-family and commercial real estate product line that is focused on the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly New York City. The strategy is to focus on refinancing existing loans with conservative underwriting and to keep costs low. Through the multi-family and commercial real estate product, Customers earns interest and fee income and generates commercial deposits. Customers also maintains a specialty lending business, commercial loans to mortgage originators, which is a national business where the Bank provides liquidity to non- 

depository mortgage companies to fund their mortgage pipelines and meet other business needs. Through the loans to mortgage bankers business, Customers earns interest and fee income and generates core deposits. 

&#8226; 

BankMobile Strategy . Customers launched BankMobile as a key strategic initiative in January 2015, recognizing the product delivery flexibility demanded by the millennial generation and the low cost of the smart phone delivery channel. BankMobile refers to Customers' efforts to build a full service bank that is accessible to our customers anywhere and anytime through the customer's smartphone or other web-enabled device. BankMobile provides a nationwide deposit-aggregation platform. BankMobile focuses on the aggregation of low-cost deposits and currently offers no fee banking, lines of credits to qualified customers, no overdraft fees, higher than average interest rate on savings, and access to 55,000 (and if the customer makes a monthly direct deposit over 400,000) ATMs across the U.S. Customers believes that by consolidating BankMobile with the Disbursements business to be obtained from Higher One, Inc., with approximately 2.0 million student deposit customers, targeted for second quarter 2016, Customers will be uniquely positioned to become the graduating students "bank for life" and service each graduate's financial needs throughout their life. Successful execution of the BankMobile strategy, including its consolidation with Higher One's Disbursements business, will greatly accelerate BankMobile's ability to achieve profitability. BankMobile's revenues are largely derived from interchange charges paid by the product selling vendor and user based fees for specific activities (such as lost card replacement) and net interest income on assets funded by the aggregated deposits. 

&#8226; 

Attractive risk profile. &#32;Customers has sought to maintain high asset quality and moderate credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and early identification of potential problem assets. Customers has also formed a special assets department to manage the covered assets portfolio and review other classified and non-performing assets. As of December 31, 2015 , only $10.8 million, or 0.15%, of the Bank's total loan portfolio was non performing. 

&#8226; 

Superior Community Banking Model. &#32;Customers expects to drive organic growth by employing its Concierge Banking&#174; strategy, which provides specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers, delivering an appointment banking approach available 12 hours a day, seven days a week. This allows Customers to provide services in a personalized, convenient and expeditious manner. This approach, coupled with superior technology, including remote account opening, remote deposit capture, mobile banking and the first fee free mobile first digital bank, BankMobile, results in a competitive advantage over larger institutions, which management believes contributes to the profitability of its franchise and allows the Bank to generate core deposits. The &#8220;high-tech, high-touch,&#8221; model requires less staff and smaller branch locations to operate, thereby significantly reducing operating costs. 

&#8226; 

Acquisition Expertise. &#32;The depth of Customers' management team and their experience working together and successfully completing acquisitions provides unique insight in identifying and analyzing potential markets and acquisition targets. The experience of Customers' team, which includes the acquisition and integration of over 35 institutions, as well as numerous asset and branch acquisitions, provides a substantial advantage in pursuing and consummating future acquisitions. Additionally, management believes Customers' strengths in structuring transactions to limit its risk, its experience in the financial reporting and regulatory process related to troubled bank acquisitions, and its ongoing risk management expertise, particularly in problem loan workouts, collectively enable it to capitalize on the potential of the franchises it acquires. With Customers' depth of operational experience in connection with completing merger and acquisition transactions, it expects to be able to integrate and reposition acquired franchises cost-efficiently with a minimum disruption to customer relationships. 

Customers believes its ability to operate efficiently is enhanced by its centralized risk management structure, its access to attractive labor and real estate costs in its markets, and an infrastructure that is unencumbered by legacy systems. Furthermore, Customers anticipates additional expense synergies from the integration of its acquisitions, which it believes will enhance its financial performance. 

Segments 

Customers has one reportable segment, &#8220;Community Banking.&#8221; All of Customers' activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the activities supports the others. For example, lending is dependent upon the ability of Customers to fund itself with deposits and borrowings while managing interest rate and credit risk. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of Customers as one segment or unit. 

Products 

Customers offers a broad range of traditional loan and deposit banking products and financial services, and more recently non-traditional products and services through the successful Phase 1 launch of BankMobile in January 2015, to its commercial and consumer customers. Customers offers an array of lending products to cater to its customers&#8217; needs, including small business loans, mortgage warehouse loans, multi-family and commercial real estate loans, equipment loans, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Customers also offers traditional deposit products, including commercial and consumer checking accounts, non-interest-bearing demand accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts and time deposit accounts and cash management services. Prior to January 2015, deposit products were available to customers only through branches of Customers Bank. With the successful launch of BankMobile, Customers is able to provide fee free banking to millennials, middle class American families and underserved consumers throughout the United States. 

Lending Activities 

Customers Bank focuses its lending efforts on the following lending areas: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Commercial Lending &#8211; includes Business Banking (commercial and industrial lending), Small and Middle Market Business Banking, including small business administration (SBA) loans, Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate lending, and commercial loans to mortgage originators; and 

&#8226; 

Consumer Lending &#8211; local market mortgage and home equity lending. 

Commercial Lending 

The Bank&#8217;s commercial lending is divided into four distinct groups: Business Banking, Small and Middle Market Business Banking, Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate Lending, and Mortgage Banking Lending. This grouping is designed to allow for greater resource deployment, higher standards of risk management, strong asset quality, lower interest rate risk and higher productivity levels. 

The commercial lending group focuses on companies with annual revenues ranging from $1.0 million to $50.0 million, which typically have credit requirements between $0.5 million and $10.0 million. 

The small and middle market business banking platform originates loans, including SBA loans, through the branch network sales force and a team of dedicated Small Business relationship managers. The support administration of the platform for this lending activity is centralized including risk management, product management, marketing, performance tracking and overall strategic planning. Credit and sales training has been established for the sales force, ensuring that the Bank has small business experts in place providing appropriate financial solutions to the small business owners in its communities. A division approach focuses on industries that offer high asset quality and are deposit rich to drive profitability. 

The goal of the Bank&#8217;s multi-family lending group is to build a portfolio of high-quality multi-family and commercial real estate loans within its covered markets, while cross selling its other products and services. This business line primarily focuses on refinancing existing loans, using conservative underwriting. The primary collateral for these loans is a first-lien mortgage on the multi-family property, plus an assignment of all leases related to such property. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank originated approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of multi-family loans. 

The goal of commercial loans to mortgage originators is to provide liquidity to mortgage companies. The loans are predominately short-term facilities used by mortgage companies to fund their pipelines from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market. Most of the individual mortgage loans that collateralize our commercial loans are insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government through one of their programs such as FHA, VA, or are conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Bank is currently expanding its product offerings to mortgage banks to meet a wider array of business needs. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank funded $29.9 billion and $18.1 billion of mortgage loans, respectively, to mortgage originators and warehouses. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank had $6.9 billion &#32;and $5.3 billion , respectively, in commercial loans outstanding, composing approximately 94.6% &#32;and 92.5% , respectively, of its total loan portfolio, which includes loans held for sale. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank originated $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of commercial loans, exclusive of multi-family loan originations and loans to mortgage originators and warehouses. 

Consumer Lending 

The Bank provides home equity and residential mortgage loans to customers. Underwriting standards for home equity lending are conservative and lending is offered to solidify customer relationships and grow relationship revenues in the long term. This lending is important in the Bank&#8217;s efforts to grow total relationship revenues for its consumer households. These areas also support the Bank's commitment to lower and moderate income families in its market area. The Bank plans to expand its product offerings in real estate secured consumer lending. 

Beginning in 2013, Customers Bank launched a community outreach program in Philadelphia to encourage a higher percentage of homeownership in urban communities. As part of this program, the Bank is offering an &#8220;Affordable Mortgage Product&#8221;. This community outreach program is penetrating the underserved population, especially in low-and moderate income neighborhoods. As part of this commitment, a loan production office was opened at Progress Plaza, 1501 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA. The program includes homebuyer seminars that prepare potential homebuyers for homeownership by teaching money management and budgeting skills, including the financial responsibilities that come with having a mortgage and owning a home. The &#8220;Affordable Mortgage Product&#8221; is offered throughout Customers Bank&#8217;s CRA assessment areas. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank had $391.7 million &#32;and $432.2 million , respectively, in consumer loans outstanding, composing 5.4% &#32;and 7.5% , respectively, of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio, which includes loans held for sale. During the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Bank originated $63.0 million and $77.0 million of consumer loans, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , consumer loans included a balance of $72.7 million and $102.9 million, respectively, of residential loans acquired from Flagstar in January 2014. 

Private Banking 

Beginning in 2013, Customers Bank introduced a Private Banking model for its commercial clients in the major markets within its geographic footprint. This unique model provides unparalleled service to customers through an in-market team of experienced private bankers. Acting as a single-point-of-contact for all the banking needs of the Bank&#8217;s commercial clients, these private bankers will deliver the whole bank &#8211; not only to its clients, but to their families, their management teams, and their employees, as well. With a world-class suite of sophisticated cash management products, these private bankers will deliver on Customers Bank&#8217;s &#8220;high-tech, high-touch&#8221; strategy and provide real value to its mid-market commercial clients. 

Customers Bank opened its first private banking representative office in Manhattan in second quarter 2013, and eventually, all of its markets will be served by private bankers. 

Deposit Products and Other Funding Sources 

Customers Bank offers a variety of deposit products to its customers, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts and other deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed-maturity retail time deposits ranging in terms from 30 days to five years, individual retirement accounts, and non-retail time deposits consisting of jumbo certificates greater than or equal to $100,000. Using its high touch supported by high tech model, the Bank has experienced significantly higher above average growth in core deposits in all of its markets. Customers Bank also utilizes wholesale deposit products, money market and certificates of deposit obtained through listing services and borrowings from the FHLB as a source of funding. These funding sources offer attractive funding costs in comparison to traditional sources of funding given the low interest rate environment. 

Financial Products and Services 

In addition to traditional banking activities, Customers Bank provides other financial services to its customers, including: mobile phone banking, internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment, lock box services, remote deposit capture services, courier services, merchant processing services, cash vault, controlled disbursements, positive pay and cash management services (including account reconciliation, collections and sweep accounts). In January 2015, the Bank successfully launched BankMobile, America's first mobile platform based full service consumer bank. BankMobile had over 100,000 new checking accounts at December 31, 2015. 

Competition 

Customers Bank competes with other financial institutions for deposit and loan business. Competitors include other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, money market funds, and certain government agencies. Financial institutions 

compete principally on the quality of the services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit products, interest rates charged on loans, fees and service charges, the convenience of banking office locations and hours of operation, and in the consideration of larger commercial borrowers, lending limits. 

Many competitors are significantly larger than Customers Bank, and have significantly greater financial resources, personnel and locations from which to conduct business. In addition, Customers Bank is subject to regulation, while certain of its competitors are not. Non-regulated companies face relatively few barriers to entry into the financial services industry. Customers Bank&#8217;s larger competitors enjoy greater name recognition and greater resources to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns. Customers Bank competes for business principally on the basis of high-quality, personal service to customers, customer access to Customers Bank&#8217;s decision makers, and competitive interest and fee structure. Customers Bank also strives to provide maximum convenience of access to services by employing innovative delivery vehicles such as internet banking, and the convenience of Concierge Banking&#174;. 

Customers Bank&#8217;s current market is primarily served by large national and regional banks, with a few larger institutions capturing more than 50% of the deposit market share. Customers Bank&#8217;s large competitors primarily utilize expensive, branch-based models to sell products to consumers and small businesses, which requires our larger competitors to price their products with wider margins and charge more fees to justify their higher expense base. While maintaining physical branch locations remains an important component of Customers Bank&#8217;s strategy, Customers Bank utilizes an operating model with fewer and less expensive locations, thereby lowering overhead costs and allowing for greater pricing flexibility. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , Customers Bancorp had 517 &#32;full-time equivalent employees.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

GENERAL 

Customers Bancorp is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank&#8217;s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, terms of deposit accounts, loans a bank makes, the interest rates it charges and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations and the establishment of branches. 

PENNSYLVANIA BANKING LAWS 

Pennsylvania banks that are Federal Reserve members may establish new branch offices only after approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). Approval by these regulators can be subject to a variety of factors, including the convenience and needs of the community, whether the institution is sufficiently capitalized and well managed, issues of safety and soundness, the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community, whether there are significant supervisory concerns with respect to the institution or affiliated organizations, and whether any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, involving bank &#8220;insiders&#8221; (directors, officers, employees and 10%-or-greater shareholders) which involves terms and conditions more favorable to the insiders than would be available in a comparable transaction with unrelated parties. 

Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, Customers Bank is permitted to branch throughout Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania law also provides Pennsylvania state-chartered banks elective parity with the power of national banks, federal thrifts, and state-chartered institutions in other states as authorized by the FDIC, subject to a required notice to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Pennsylvania Banking Code also imposes restrictions on payment of dividends, as well as minimum capital requirements. 

On October 24, 2012, Pennsylvania enacted three laws known as the &#8220;Banking Law Modernization Package,&#8221; all of which became effective on December 24, 2012. The intended goal of the law, which applies to Customers Bank, is to modernize Pennsylvania&#8217;s banking laws and to reduce regulatory burden at the state level where possible, given the increased regulatory demands at the federal level as described below. 

The law also permits banks to disclose formal enforcement actions initiated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, clarifies that the Department has examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries as well as affiliates of regulated banks and bolsters the Department&#8217;s enforcement authority over its regulated institutions by clarifying its ability to remove directors, officers and employees from institutions for violations of laws or orders or for any unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty. Changes to existing law also allow the Department to assess civil money penalties of up to $25,000 per violation. 

The law also sets a new standard of care for bank officers and directors, applying the same standard that exists for non-banking corporations in Pennsylvania. The standard is one of performing duties in good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the institutions and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. Directors may rely in good faith on information, opinions and reports provided by officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, or committees of the board, and an officer may not be held liable simply because he or she served as an officer of the institution. 

Interstate Branching . Federal law allows the Federal Reserve and FDIC, and the Pennsylvania Banking Code allows the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches. For more information on federal law, see the discussion under &#8220;Federal Banking Laws &#8211; Interstate Branching&#8221; that follows. 

Pennsylvania banking laws authorize banks in Pennsylvania to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in other states, and also permits out-of-state banks to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in Pennsylvania. 

In April 2008, Banking Regulators in the States of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the &#8220;Interstate MOU&#8221;) to clarify their respective roles, as home and host state regulators, regarding interstate branching activity on a regional basis pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997. The Interstate MOU establishes the regulatory responsibilities of the respective state banking regulators regarding bank regulatory examinations and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on state-chartered banks branching within the region by eliminating duplicative host state compliance exams. 

Under the Interstate MOU, the activities of branches Customers established in New Jersey or New York would be governed by Pennsylvania state law to the same extent that federal law governs the activities of the branch of an out-of-state national bank in such host states. Issues regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted are to be determined in the first instance by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In the event that the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the applicable host state regulator disagree regarding whether a particular host state law is pre-empted, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the applicable host state regulator would use their reasonable best efforts to consider all points of view and to resolve the disagreement. 

FEDERAL BANKING LAWS 

Interstate Branching. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (called the &#8220;Interstate Act&#8221;), among other things, permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state. A bank may also merge with a bank in another state. Interstate acquisitions and mergers are subject, in general, to certain concentration limits and state entry rules relating to the age of the Bank. Under the Interstate Act, the responsible federal regulatory agency is permitted to approve the acquisition of less than all of the branches of an insured bank by an out-of-state bank or bank holding company without the acquisition of an entire bank, only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits. Under the Interstate Act, branches of state-chartered banks that operate in other states are covered by the laws of the chartering state, rather than the host state. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) created a more permissive 

interstate branching regime by permitting banks to establish branches de novo in any state if a bank chartered by such state would have been permitted to establish the branch. For more information on interstate branching under Pennsylvania law, see &#8220;Pennsylvania Banking Laws &#8211; Interstate Branching&#8221; above. 

Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking law mandates certain &#8220;prompt corrective actions,&#8221; which Federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a Federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations have been adopted by the Federal bank regulatory agencies setting forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized. Under the rules, an institution will be deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or better if it exceeds the minimum Federal regulatory capital requirements. However, it will be deemed &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, or has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%, and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. The rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain restrictions including a prohibition on the payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, and in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain &#8220;management fees&#8221; to any &#8220;controlling person.&#8221; Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring, a limitation on the institution&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business, obligations to raise additional capital, restrictions on transactions with affiliates, and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; and continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership. 

Safety and Soundness; Regulation of Bank Management . The Federal Reserve Board possesses the power to prohibit a bank from engaging in any activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and in violation of the law. Moreover, Federal law enactments have expanded the circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution&#8217;s Federal supervisory agency; restricted and further regulated lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or related interests thereof; restricted management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions with certain depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified amount or which have an office within a specified geographic area; and restricted management personnel from borrowing from another institution that has a correspondent relationship with the bank for which they work. 

Capital Rules . Federal banking agencies have issued certain &#8220;risk-based capital&#8221; guidelines, which supplemented existing capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board imposes certain &#8220;leverage&#8221; requirements on member banks. Banking regulators have authority to require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual bank or bank holding company in view of its circumstances. 

The risk-based capital guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital levels in compliance with &#8220;risk-based capital&#8221; ratios. In these ratios, the on-balance sheet assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned a risk-weight based upon the perceived and historical risk of incurring a loss of principal from that exposure. For periods ending prior January 1, 2015 the first is a minimum ratio of total capital (&#8220;Tier 1&#8221; and &#8220;Tier 2&#8221; capital) to risk-weighted assets equal to 8.0%, and the second is a minimum ratio of &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; capital to risk-weighted assets equal to 4.0%. Assets are assigned to five risk categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. In making the calculation, certain intangible assets must be deducted from the capital base. The risk-based capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. 

The risk-based capital rules also may consider interest rate risk. Institutions with interest rate risk exposure above a normal level would be required to hold extra capital in proportion to that risk. The Bank currently monitors and manages its assets and liabilities for interest rate risk, and management believes that the interest rate risk rules which have been implemented and proposed will not materially adversely affect its operations. 

The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s &#8220;leverage&#8221; ratio rules require member banks which are rated the highest in the composite areas of capital, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity to maintain a ratio of &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; capital to &#8220;adjusted total assets&#8221; of not less than 3.0%. For banks which are not the most highly rated, the minimum &#8220;leverage&#8221; ratio will range from 4.0% to 5.0%, or 

higher at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to be at a level commensurate with the nature of the level of risk of the Bancorp's condition and activities. 

For purposes of the capital requirements, &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; or &#8220;core&#8221; capital is defined to include common shareholders&#8217; equity and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. &#8220;Tier 2&#8221; or &#8220;qualifying supplementary&#8221; capital is defined to include a bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, plus certain types of preferred stock and related surplus, certain &#8220;hybrid capital instruments&#8221; and certain term subordinated debt instruments. 

New Capital Rules. &#32;On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank. The FDIC and the OCC have subsequently approved these rules. The final rules were adopted following the issuance of proposed rules by the Federal Reserve in June 2012 and implement the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. &#8220;Basel III&#8221; refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. 

The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating those ratios. Effective January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank under the final rules are: 

(i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; 

(ii) a Tier 1 Risk based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); 

(iii) a Total Risk based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015); and 

(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. 

The final rules also establish a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. 

The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. 

Effective January 1, 2016, the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank under the final rules are: 

(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 5.125%; 

(ii) a Tier 1 Risk based capital ratio of 6.625%; 

(iii) a Total Risk based capital ratio of 8.625%; and 

(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.625% for all institutions. 

Considering the capital conservation buffer, to avoid limitations on certain actions or activities, banks will be required to maintain the following ratios beginning in 2019: 

(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; 

(ii) a Tier 1 Risk Based capital ratio of 8.5%; 

(iii) a Total Risk based capital ratio of 10.5%; and 

(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.5% for all institutions. 

Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the minimum capital level plus buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 

Basel III provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer, the &#8220;countercyclical buffer,&#8221; of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the final rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to &#8220;advanced approach banks&#8221; (i.e., banks with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures), which currently excludes the Bancorp and the Bank. The final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components 

of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Bancorp) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. 

In addition, the final rules provide for smaller banking institutions (less than $250 billion in consolidated assets) an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Importantly, the opt-out excludes from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, but also accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans. Customers Bank selected the opt-out election in its March 31, 2015 Call Report. 

The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect on January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized:&#8221; 

(i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; 

(ii) a Tier 1 Risk based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); 

(iii) a Total Risk based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015); and 

(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (increased from 4%). 

The final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which were required to be utilized as of January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also addresses: 

(i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; 

(ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; 

(iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; 

(iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and 

(v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the &#8220;advance approach rules&#8221; that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets. 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , management believed that the Bank and Bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. For additional information on Customers' regulatory ratios, refer to &#8220;NOTE 18 &#8211; REGULATORY MATTERS.&#8221; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank bill was enacted by Congress on July 15, 2010, and was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. Among many other provisions, the legislation: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a federal agency acting as the financial system&#8217;s systemic risk regulator with the authority to review the activities of significant bank holding companies and non-bank financial firms, to make recommendations and impose standards regarding capital, leverage, conflicts and other requirements for financial firms and to impose regulatory standards on certain financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial health of the U.S. economy; 

&#8226; 

created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has substantive rule-making authority over a wide variety of consumer financial services and products, including the power to regulate unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 

&#8226; 

permitted state attorneys general and other state enforcement authorities broader power to enforce consumer protection laws against banks; 

&#8226; 

authorized federal regulatory agencies to ban compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct that could pose risks to the nation&#8217;s financial system; 

&#8226; 

granted the U.S. government resolution authority to liquidate or take emergency measures with regard to troubled financial institutions, such as bank holding companies, that fall outside the existing resolution authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; 

&#8226; 

gave the FDIC substantial new authority and flexibility in assessing deposit insurance premiums, which may result in increased deposit insurance premiums for us in the future; 

&#8226; 

increased the deposit insurance coverage limit for insurable deposits to $250,000 generally, and removes the limit entirely for transaction accounts; 

&#8226; 

permitted banks to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts; 

&#8226; 

extended the national bank lending (or loans-to-one-borrower) limits to other institutions; 

&#8226; 

prohibited banks subject to enforcement action such as a memorandum of understanding from changing their charter without the approval of both their existing charter regulator and their proposed new charter regulator; and 

&#8226; 

imposed new limits on asset purchase and sale transactions between banks and their insiders. 

Many of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, including Customers Bank&#8217;s primary federal banking regulator, the Federal Reserve. It is not possible to predict at this time the extent to which regulations authorized or mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act will impose requirements or restrictions on Customers Bank in addition to or different from the provisions summarized above. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments . Customers Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). Under this system, the amount of FDIC assessments paid by an individual insured depository institution, like Customers Bank, is based on the level of perceived risk incurred in its activities. The FDIC places a depository institution in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rates based on certain specified financial ratios. 

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system and setting initial base assessment rates beginning April 1, 2011, ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points of Tier I capital. 

In addition to deposit insurance assessments, banks are subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. The FDIC sets the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter. 

Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks must be considered by the appropriate Federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, in reviewing and approving or disapproving a variety of regulatory applications including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger and certain acquisitions. Federal banking agencies have demonstrated an increased readiness to deny applications based on unsatisfactory CRA performance. The Federal Reserve Board is required to assess our record to determine if we are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low and moderate neighborhoods) that we serve. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 amended the CRA to require, among other things, that the Federal Reserve Board make publicly available an evaluation of the Bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. This evaluation includes a descriptive rating (outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance) and a statement describing the basis for the rating. 

Consumer Protection Laws . Customers Bank is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act adopted as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations adopted thereunder. In the aggregate, compliance with these consumer protection laws and regulations involves substantial expense and administrative time on the part of Customers. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

As a bank holding company, Customers Bancorp is also subject to additional regulation. 

The Bank Holding Company Act requires the Bancorp to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank. It also prohibits acquisition by the Bancorp of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of, or interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, any bank located outside of the state in which a current bank subsidiary is located unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by laws of the state in which such bank is located. A bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company would offer benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Applications under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Control Act are subject to review, based upon the record of compliance of the applicant with the CRA. 

The Bancorp is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. Further, under Section 106 of the 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s regulations, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or provision of any property or services. The so-called &#8220;anti-tie-in&#8221; provisions state generally that a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer obtains additional credit or service from Customers Bank, or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor. 

The Federal Reserve Board permits bank holding companies to engage in non-banking activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. A number of activities are authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulation, while other activities require prior Federal Reserve Board approval. The types of permissible activities are subject to change by the Federal Reserve Board.
