&#160; 

Background 

&#160; 

Demand for our insulation products and services is driven by new single - family residential and multi-family construction , remodeling and repair activity, commercial construction, building codes, and the growing need for energy efficiency. Being a leader in both installation and distribution allows us to more effectively reach a broader set of customers, regardless of their size or geographic location within the U.S. We recognize that competition for the installation and sale of insulation and other building products occurs in localized geographic markets throughout the country, and as such our operating model is based on branches building and maintaining local customer relationships. At the same time, our local operations benefit from centralized functions such as information technology, credit, and purchasing. 

&#160; 

Competitive Advantage s 

&#160; 

The mar ket for the distribution and installation of building products is highly fragmented and competitive. Barriers to entry for local competitors are relatively low, increasing the risk that additional competitors will emerge. Our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industry depends on a number of factors including our national scale, sales channels, diversified product lines, a strong local presence, and strong cash flows. 

&#160; 

National scale. With our national footprint, we provide products and services to each major construction line of business in the U.S. Our national scale, together with our centralized TopBuild executive management team, allows us to compete locally by: 

&#160; 

&#8226; P roviding national and regional builders with broad geographic reach, while maintaining consistent policies and practices that enable reliable, high &#8209;quality products and services across many geographies and building sites 

&#8226; E stablishing strong ties to major manufacturers of insulation and other building products that help ensure we are buying competitively, have availability of supply to our local branches and distribution centers and are driving efficiencies throughout our supply chain 

&#8226; P roviding consistent, customized support and geographic coverage to our customers 

&#8226; M aintaining an operating capacity that allows us to ramp &#8209;up rapidly, without major incremental investment, to target forecasted growth in housing starts and construction activity in each of our lines of business anywhere in the U.S . 

&#8226; L everaging investments in systems and processes and sharing best practices across both our installation and distribution businesses 

Two avenues to reach the builder. We believe having both an installation and distribution business provides a number of advantages to reaching our customers and driving share gains. Our installation business customer base includes builders of all sizes. Our branches go to market with the local brands that small builders recognize and value, and our national footprint is appealing to large builders who value consistency across a broad geography. Our distribution business focuses on selling to small contractors who are particularly adept at cultivating the local relationships with small custom builders. Being a leader in both installation and distribution allows us to more effectively reach a broader set of builder customers, regardless of their size or geographic location within the U.S., and leverage housing growth wherever it occurs. 

Diversified lines of business. In response to the housing downturn in prior years, we enhanced our ability to serve the residential repair/remodel and commercial construction markets. Although the residential repair/remodel and commercial construction markets are affected by many of the same macroeconomic and local economic factors that drive residential new construction, residential repair/remodel and commercial construction have historically followed different cycles than 

&#160;

residential new construction. We have thus positioned our business to benefit from a greater mix of residential repair/remodel activity and commercial construction activity than we have historically, which helps reduce volatility because we are less dependent on residential new construction, and also enables us to better respond to changes in customer demand. 

Strong local presence. Competition for the installation and sale of insulation and other building products to builders occurs in localized geographic markets throughout the country. Builders in each local market have different options in terms of choosing among insulation installers and distributors for their projects, and value local relationships, quality and timeliness. Our installation branches are locally branded businesses that are recognized within the communities in which they operate. Our distribution centers service primarily local contractors, lumberyards, retail stores and others who, in turn, service local homebuilders and other customers. Our branch &#8209; and distribution center &#8209;based operating model, in which individual branches and distribution centers maintain local customer relationships, enables us to develop local, long &#8209;tenured relationships with these customers, build local reputations for quality, service and timeliness and provide specialized products and personalized services tailored to a geographic region. At the same time, our local operations benefit from centralized functions such as information technology, credit and purchasing, and the resources and scale efficiencies of an installation and distribution business that has a presence across the U.S. 

Reduced exposure to residential housing cyclicality. During industry downturns many insulation contractors , who buy directly from manufacturers during industry peaks , return to purchasing through distributors for small, &#8220;Less Than Truckload&#8221; shipments, reduced warehousing needs, and access to purchases on credit. This drives incremental customers to Service Partners during these points in the business cycle. As a result, our leadership position in both installation and distribution helps to reduce exposure to cyclical swings in our lines of business. 

Strong cash flow, low capital investment , and favorable working capital fund organic growth. Over the last several years, we have reduced fixed costs. As a result, we can achieve profitability at lower levels of demand as compared to historical periods. For further discussion on our cash flows and liquidity, see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources . 

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

We have a diversified portfolio of customers and no single customer accounted for 3% or more of our total revenues. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 10% of our total sales in 2015. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Due to our customers&#8217; need for timely installation of our products, our installation jobs are scheduled and completed within a short timeframe. We do not consider backlog material to our business. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

Our businesses depend on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of high quality products and components from manufacturers and other suppliers. We rely heavily on third party suppliers for our products and key components. We source the majority of our building products from four primary U.S. based residential fiberglass insulation manufacturers : Owens Corning, Knauf, CertainTeed , and Johns Manville. Failure by our suppliers to provide us with an adequate supply of high quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with applicable legal requirements, could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We believe we have good relationships with our suppliers. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 8,000 employees. Approximately 490 of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Executive Management 

&#160; 

See Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance . &#160; 

&#160; 

Legislation and Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to U.S., state and local regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety (including protection of employees and consumers), labor standards/regulations, contractor licensing , and environmental issues. &#160; In addition to complying with current effective requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date, even more stringent requirements could eventually be imposed on our industries. Additionally, some of our products and services may require certification by industry or other organizations. Compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our distribution and installation processes and our sourcing, which could adversely impact our competitive position. Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our operating results could be negatively affected . 

&#160;
