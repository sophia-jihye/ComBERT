 Item 1. Business 

Introduction and General Background 

Command Center, Inc. (&#8220;Command Center,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a staffing company, operating primarily in the manual labor segment of the staffing industry. In 2015, we employed approximately 32,600 workers providing services to approximately 3,300 customers, primarily in the areas of light industrial, hospitality and event services. Our customers range in size from small businesses to large corporate enterprises. All of our field team members are employed by us. Most of our work assignments are short term and many are filled on little notice from our customers. In addition to short and longer term temporary work assignments, we sometimes recruit and place workers in temp-to-hire situations. 

As of December 25, 2015, we owned and operated 57 on-demand labor stores in 20 states. We currently operate as Command Center, Inc. Prior to 2014, we also operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Disaster Recovery Services, Inc., which is now inactive. We have also created a separate, dormant entity, ComStaff, Inc. All financial information is consolidated and reported in our consolidated financial statements. In 2015 we moved our corporate headquarters from Coeur d&#8217;Alene, Idaho to Lakewood, Colorado. 

We were organized as Command Staffing, LLC on December 26, 2002 and commenced operations in 2003 as a franchisor of on-demand labor businesses. In November 2005, the assets of Command Staffing, LLC and Harborview Software, Inc., an affiliated company that owned the software used in the operation of our on-demand labor stores, were acquired by Temporary Financial Services, Inc., a public company. The transaction was accounted for as if Command Staffing, LLC was the accounting acquirer. In November 2005, we changed our name to Command Center, Inc. 

Prior to April 2006, we generated revenues primarily from franchise fees. In May 2006, we acquired approximately 50 on-demand labor stores from certain former franchisees, and shifted our business focus from franchisor to operator. We currently generate all of our revenue from on-demand labor store operations and related activities. 

Industry Overview 

The on-demand labor industry developed based on the business need for flexible staffing options. Many businesses operate in a cyclical production environment and find it difficult to staff according to their changing production cycles. Companies also desire a way to temporarily replace full-time employees when absent due to illness, vacation, or unplanned termination. On-demand labor offers employers the opportunity to immediately respond to changes in staffing needs, reduce the costs associated with recruiting and interviewing, eliminate unemployment and workers&#8217; compensation exposure, and draw from a larger employment pool. 

The on-demand labor industry continues to develop specialized market segments that reflect the diverse needs of the businesses it serves. Technical skills, prior work history, duration of assignment, and background check requirements vary among industries and employers. We operate primarily within the short-term, semi-skilled and unskilled segments of the on-demand labor industry. We endeavor to customize our services according to the unique opportunities and assets presented by each of our locations while leveraging our overall size. This approach reduces our overhead costs, improves economies of scale, establishes procedural uniformity and internal controls, and creates a predictable internal environment for our Field Team Members.

Business 

Strategic Growth Opportunities: We continue to build our network of on-demand labor stores. In 2015, we opened six new branches, as we expanded our operations while continuing to improve our business fundamentals. In 2016, we plan to continue our strategy of carefully balancing store expansion against a prudent return on investment. In doing so, we expect to concentrate our revenue growth efforts primarily in same store sales growth within our existing branch structure, while opening new branches in areas we believe present exceptional opportunities. In all of our growth opportunities, we continue to emphasize the fundamentals of our business: sell to quality accounts, increase margins where possible and provide exceptional customer service. 

On-demand Labor Store Operations: In 2015, we continued to focus on the basics of our business: consistency and excellence in service, increases in margins, containment of costs, selling techniques, and company culture. We concentrated on these measures to improve profitability and solidify the groundwork for future growth. 

During the year, we employed approximately 32,600 temporary employees and serviced approximately 3,300 clients. Our stores are located in 20 states. Our stores are often located in proximity to concentrated commercial and industrial areas typically with access to public transportation and other services that are important to our temporary staff. We have developed a store demographic model to identify and qualify future possible store locations. 

We manage our field operations using in-store personnel, area managers and corporate management personnel. Where appropriate, we also include business development specialists to help drive business to our stores. The intention and structure of our compensation plans for store managers, area managers, and business development specialists have been designed to aid in securing and retaining the qualified personnel needed to meet our business, financial, and growth objectives. Our personnel practices are designed to support our need to attract, screen, hire, train, support and retain qualified personnel at all levels of our business. We take best practices information from our higher performing stores and propagate this information across all operating groups to produce consistent execution and improvements in company-wide performance averages. 

Our Temporary Staff (Field Team Members): Field team members are our product and our key asset. Our success is based on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and reward our field team members. We have invested in many proprietary programs designed to create a long term relationship with top-performing field team members. These programs include health insurance, bonus programs, safety rewards, longevity programs, training programs, and career services. As a matter of corporate policy, we know our field team members by name and show appreciation for the value they bring to our organization and to our client&#8217;s workplace. 

The pool of qualified, available field team members varies by location. For most of our offices, the supply of workers is sufficient and diverse enough to meet current client needs. However, in some locations, worker availability is a limiting factor. We continue to seek additional field team members through internet postings, newspaper advertisements, printed flyers, store displays, career fairs, and word-of-mouth. We issued approximately 32,600 W-2 forms in 2015, a slight increase from approximately 32,400 issued in 2014. 

Our Customers: In 2015, we serviced approximately 3,300 customers in a variety of industries. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of our revenue in 2015. The top six industries we served were services, manufacturing, construction, retail trade, transportation, and wholesale (trade). 

Our Marketing Strategy: We recognize that our clients are too busy to have time consumed by a traditional sales person, but rather are looking for a consultant that provides smart solutions to their current challenges. Our unique sales process starts by learning about potential clients and facilitating conversations with them where we offer support and contribute to a growing relationship. Together, we create an action plan that draws on our core competencies and solves our potential client's needs. Once we have resolved one need, we consistently strive to meet future needs, with the goal of converting a business prospect to a repeat client. We serve many of our existing customers from multiple stores, across multiple cities, and in many cases, across multiple states. We have tailored programs to specifically address the needs of these national accounts and plan to continue our efforts with respect to national accounts in the year ahead. 

Our Workers&#8217; Compensation Coverage: In accordance with the laws of every state, we provide our temporary and permanent workers with workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Currently, we are covered under a large deductible policy where we have primary responsibility for claims under the policy. Under our current policy which has been in place since April 1, 2014, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $500,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $500,000 are the responsibility of our workers&#8217; compensation insurance provider. From April 1, 2012 until March 31, 2013 we were covered under a large deductible policy issued by our former carrier. Under the prior policy, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $350,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $350,000 are the responsibility of our workers&#8217; compensation insurance provider. Our policy between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2014 was a guaranteed cost policy where we were fully insured on all claims occurring in covered states. Our policies before April 1, 2011 were large deductible policies similar to our current coverage. Under these prior policies, we still have a primary responsibility for all claims occurring before April 1, 2011 until all claims are resolved completely, up to our deductible of $250,000 on a per claim basis. Amounts in excess of $250,000 are the responsibility of our previous workers&#8217; compensation insurance providers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

For workers&#8217; compensation claims originating in Washington and North Dakota, we pay workers&#8217; compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under mandatory government administered programs. Our liability associated with claims in these jurisdictions is limited to our premium payments. 

Our Safety Program: To protect our workforce and help control workers&#8217; compensation insurance rates, we maintain several Company-wide safety programs designed to increase awareness of safety issues. We provide safety training through videos, employee safety manuals, and safety testing. Managers conduct job site safety inspections on new jobs to ensure that our field team members are working in a safe environment. We encourage safe work behavior through an incentive program that rewards our field team members for working accident free. We also encourage our field team members to report unsafe working conditions. We evaluate the risk profile of the work we undertake on an ongoing basis and sometimes restrict classes of work in order to minimize risk. 

Our Seasonality: Some of the industries we in which operate are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Many of the jobs filled by field team members are outdoor jobs that are generally performed during the warmer months of the year. As a result, activity increases in the spring and continues at higher levels through summer, then begins to taper off during fall and through winter. Seasonal fluctuations are typically less in the western and southwestern parts of the United States where many of our stores are located. These fluctuations in seasonal business affect financial performance from period to period. 

Our Competition: The manual labor sector of the on-demand labor industry in which we operate is largely fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our competitors range in size from small, local or regional operators with five or fewer locations to large, multi-national operations with hundreds of locations. 

The primary competitive factors in our market segment include price, the ability to timely provide the requested workers, and overall quality of service. Secondary factors include worker quality and performance, efficiency, the ability to meet the business-to-business vendor requirements, name recognition, established reputation, and customer relationships. While barriers to entry are low, businesses operating in this sector of the on-demand labor industry do require access to significant working capital, particularly in the spring and summer when seasonal staffing requirements are higher. Lack of working capital can be a significant impediment to growth for small, local, and regional on-demand labor providers. In addition, the growth in government regulation is also creating a barrier to entry as many smaller firms cannot profitably comply with the administrative burden of the new regulations. 

Our Trademarks and Trade Names: We have registered &#8220;Command,&#8221; &#8220;Command Center,&#8221; &#8220;Command Staffing,&#8221; &#8220;Command Labor,&#8221; &#8220;Real Jobs for Real People,&#8221; &#8220;Bakken Staffing.&#8221; &#8220;Disaster Recovery Services,&#8221; &#8220;Apply Today, Daily Pay,&#8221; &#8220;A Different Kind of Labor Place,&#8221; and &#8220;Labor Commander,&#8221; as service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

Our Intellectual Property: We have software systems in place to handle most aspects of our operations, including temporary staff dispatch activities, invoicing, accounts receivable, and payroll. Our software systems also provide internal control over our operations, as well as producing internal management reports necessary to track the financial performance of individual stores. We utilize a dashboard-type system to provide management with critical information and we refine our systems and processes based on the feedback we receive. We have invested in proper off-site back-up and storage systems that protect our electronic information systems against breakdowns and other disruptions that may be beyond our control. 

Our Real Property: We lease the facilities of all of our store locations and our corporate office. All of these facilities are leased at market rates that vary, depending on location. Each store is between 1,000 and 5,000 square feet, depending on locations and market conditions. We believe that our corporate office and each of the store locations are adequate for our current needs. 

Our Employees: We currently employ a staff of approximately 30 at our corporate headquarters in Lakewood, Colorado. The number of employees at the corporate headquarters is not expected to increase significantly over the next year. We also employ approximately 180 field operations staff located at the various on-demand labor stores. During the fiscal year, we employed approximately 32,600 temporary workers. We are the employer of our temporary workers and, as such, are responsible for collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security, unemployment tax, workers&#8217; compensation, other insurance programs and all other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In addition to completing the Form I-9 required by the Department of Homeland Security, we also confirm the identity and work eligibility of each applicant through the federal E-Verify system.
