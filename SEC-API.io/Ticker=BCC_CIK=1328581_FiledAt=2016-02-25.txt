 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Boise Cascade is a large, vertically-integrated wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor with widespread operations throughout the United States. As used in this Form 10-K, the terms "Boise Cascade," "we," and "our" refer to Boise Cascade Company (formerly known as Boise Cascade, L.L.C.) and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the largest producers of plywood and engineered wood products (EWP) in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products. Our broad line of products is used primarily in new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling projects, light commercial construction, and industrial applications. We have a broad base of more than 4,500 customers, which includes a diverse mix of retail lumberyards, home improvement centers, leading wholesalers, and industrial converters. We believe our large, vertically-integrated operations provide us with significant advantages over less integrated competitors and position us to optimally serve our customers. Our operations began on October 29, 2004, when we acquired the forest products assets of OfficeMax. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock on February 11, 2013. 

Our Industry 

The building products manufacturing and distribution industry in North America is highly competitive, with a number of producers manufacturing and selling a broad range of products. Demand for our products is principally influenced by new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity, light commercial construction, and industrial consumption in the United States. Demand drivers include new household formation, the age of the housing stock, availability of credit and other macroeconomic factors, such as GDP growth, population growth and migration, interest rates, employment, and consumer sentiment. Purchasing decisions made by the customers who buy our wood products are generally based on price, quality, and particularly with respect to EWP, customer service and product support. 

Segments 

We operate our business using three reportable segments: Wood Products, Building Materials Distribution, and Corporate and Other. We present information pertaining to our segments, including product sales, customer concentration, and the geographic areas in which we operate, in Note 15, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 

Wood Products 

Products 

We manufacture structural, appearance, and industrial plywood panels. In addition, we manufacture EWP, consisting of laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-joists, and laminated beams, which are structural products used in applications where extra strength and consistent quality are required, such as headers and beams. LVL is also used in the manufacture of I-joists, which are assembled by combining a vertical web of oriented strand board (OSB) with top and bottom LVL or solid wood flanges. We also produce ponderosa pine lumber, studs, and particleboard.

Segment sales are calculated before elimination of sales to our Building Materials Distribution segment. 

(c) 

Segment EBITDA is calculated as segment income (loss) before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments. See "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" of this Form 10-K for a description of our reasons for using EBITDA, for a discussion of the limitations of such a measure, and for a reconciliation of our consolidated net income (loss) to EBITDA. 

Facilities 

Our Wood Products segment operates nine plywood and veneer plants, six of which manufacture inputs used in our EWP facilities. In addition, our Wood Products segment operates four EWP facilities, the two most significant of which have a 

&#32; 

high degree of raw material and manufacturing integration with our plywood and veneer facilities. We also operate five sawmills and one particleboard plant. 

Raw Materials and Input Costs &#32; 

Wood fiber. &#32;&#32;The primary raw material in our Wood Products segment is wood fiber. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , wood fiber accounted for approximately 42% &#32; of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) in our Wood Products segment. Our plywood and veneer facilities use Douglas fir, white woods, pine, and hardwood logs as raw materials. We use ponderosa pine, spruce, and white fir logs to manufacture various grades of lumber. Our EWP facilities use parallel-laminated veneer panels and veneer sheets produced by our facilities and purchased from third parties, as well as stress-rated lumber and OSB purchased from third parties, to manufacture LVL and I-joists. Our manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to active wood markets. 

Logs comprised approximately 82% &#32; of our wood fiber costs during 2015 , and we satisfy our log requirements through a combination of purchases under supply agreements, open-market purchases, and purchases pursuant to contracts awarded under public auctions. 

W e bid in auctions conducted by federal, state, and local authorities for the purchase of timber, generally at fixed prices, under contracts with terms of generally one to three years. In 2015 , approximately 18% &#32;of our timber was supplied under government contracts. The remainder of our log supply in 2015 &#32;was supplied through private purchases directly from timber owners or through dealers. 

Our log and fiber requirements and our access to supply, as well as the cost of obtaining logs, are subject to change based on, among other things, the effect of governmental laws and regulations, our manufacturing operations not operating in the normal course of business, log and fiber availability, and the status of environmental appeals. For a discussion of contractual commitments relating to fiber supply agreements, see "Contractual Obligations" in "Item 8. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K. 

The cost of logs is strongly correlated with prevailing product prices for building materials and manufacturers' expectations for future product prices, with the increase in product prices driving increases in log costs. Because wood fiber is a commodity, prices have been historically cyclical in response to changes in domestic and foreign demand and supply. Demand for dimension lumber has a strong influence on pricing, as the dimension lumber industry is the largest consumer of logs. Generally, increases in the cost of logs lag product price increases, as improved manufacturer profitability often leads to increased demand for logs. In the future, we expect the level of foreign demand for log exports from the western U.S. to fluctuate based on economic activity in China and other Pacific Rim countries, currency exchange rates, and the availability of log supplies from other countries such as Canada, Russia, and New Zealand. Sustained periods of high log costs may impair the cost competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities. 

Our aggregate cost of obtaining logs is also affected by fuel costs and the distance of the fiber source from our facilities, as we are often required to transport the logs we purchase from the source to our facilities. 

Other raw materials and energy costs. We use a significant quantity of various resins and glues in our manufacturing processes. Resin and glue product costs are influenced by changes in the prices of raw material input costs, primarily fossil fuel products. We purchase resins and glues, other raw materials, and energy used to manufacture our products in both the open market and through supply contracts. The contracts are generally with regional suppliers who agree to supply all of our needs for a certain raw material or energy within the applicable region. These contracts have terms of various lengths and typically contain price adjustment mechanisms that take into account changes in market prices. Therefore, although our long-term contracts provide us with supplies of raw materials and energy that are more stable than open-market purchases, in many cases, they may not alleviate fluctuations in market prices. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

Sales of plywood, lumber, and particleboard are managed by product. Our EWP sales force is managed centrally through a main office that oversees regional sales teams. Our sales force spends a significant amount of time working with end customers who purchase our EWP. Our sales force provides a variety of technical support services, including integrated design, engineering, product specification software, distributor inventory management software, and job-pack preparation systems. 

&#32; 

In 2015 , plywood, EWP, and lumber accounted for 40%, 40%, and 8%, respectively, of our Wood Products sales. The majority of our wood products are sold to leading wholesalers (including our Building Materials Distribution segment), home improvement centers, retail lumberyards, and industrial converters in North America. Our Building Materials Distribution segment is our Wood Products segment's largest customer, representing approximately 42% &#32;of our Wood Products segment's overall sales in 2015 . In 2015 , 26% , 66% , and 10% &#32;of our Wood Products segment's plywood, EWP, and lumber sales volumes, respectively, were to our Building Materials Distribution segment.

Segment Strategy 

Grow Our Operations With a Focus on Expanding Our Capacity in EWP 

We have expanded our market position in EWP by utilizing our large-scale manufacturing position, comprehensive customer service, design support capabilities, and efficient distribution network. We expect to see further increases in EWP demand as a result of the on-going recovery in housing construction and intend to take advantage of these increases by expanding our capacity through capital investments in low-cost, internal veneer manufacturing. We have also developed strategic relationships with third-party veneer suppliers to support additional EWP production as needed. Additionally, we have grown and intend to continue to grow our Wood Products business through strategic acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of Georgia-Pacific LLC's engineered lumber production facilities. For further discussion, see Note 10, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10&#8209;K. 

Continue to Improve Our Competitiveness Through Operational Excellence 

We use a disciplined cost management approach to maximize our competitiveness without sacrificing our ability to react to future growth opportunities. Additionally, we have made capital investments and process improvements in certain facilities. These capital investments and process improvements have decreased our production costs and allowed us to produce lower-cost, higher-quality veneers. Beginning in 2009, we adopted a data-driven process improvement program to further strengthen our manufacturing operations. Because of the gains we continue to see from this program, we believe there are opportunities to further apply this process improvement program in our manufacturing operations and apply similar techniques and methods to different functional areas (including sales and marketing) to realize efficiencies in those areas. 

Building Materials Distribution 

Products 

We sell a broad line of building materials, including OSB, plywood, and lumber (collectively commodities), general line items such as siding, metal products, insulation, roofing, and composite decking, and EWP. Except for EWP and plywood, we purchase most of these building materials from a vendor base of more than 1,100 third-party suppliers ranging from large manufacturers, such as James Hardie Building Products, Trex Company, Huber Engineered Woods, Louisiana-Pacific, Georgia-Pacific, and West Fraser, to small regional producers. Substantially all of our EWP is sourced from our Wood Products segment. Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair and remodeling of existing housing, and the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings.

Facilities 

Our Building Materials Distribution segment operates a nationwide network of 32 building materials distribution facilities throughout the United States. Our Building Materials Distribution segment also operates a single truss manufacturing plant. Our broad geographic presence reduces our exposure to market factors in any single region. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

We market our building materials primarily to retail lumberyards and home improvement centers that then sell the products to end customers, who are typically professional builders, independent contractors, and homeowners engaged in residential construction and repair-and-remodeling projects. We also market our products to a wide variety of industrial accounts, which use our products to assemble cabinets, doors, agricultural bins, crating, and other products used in industrial and construction applications. We believe that our national presence and long-standing relationships with many of our key suppliers allow us to obtain favorable price and term arrangements and offer excellent customer service on top brands in the building materials industry. We also believe our broad product line provides our customers with an efficient, one-stop resource for their building materials needs. We also have expertise in special-order sourcing and merchandising support, which is a key service for our home improvement center customers that choose not to stock certain items in inventory. 

Each of our distribution centers implements its own distribution and logistics model using centralized information systems. We use internal and external trucking resources to deliver materials on a regularly scheduled basis. Our highly efficient logistics system allows us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital. 

We have a large, decentralized sales force to support our suppliers and customers. Our sales force and product managers have local product knowledge and decision-making authority, which we believe enables them to optimize stocking, pricing, and product assortment decisions. Our sales force has access to centralized information technology systems, an 

&#32; 

extensive vendor base, and corporate-level working capital support, which we believe complements our localized sales model. Our sales force is compensated, in part, based on branch-level performance. 

We regularly evaluate opportunities to introduce new products. Broadening our product offering helps us serve as a one-stop resource for building materials, which we believe improves our customers' purchasing and operating efficiencies. The introduction of new products is primarily driven by customer demand or product extensions originating from our vendors. We believe our long-standing customer relationships allow us to respond to customer feedback and introduce new products more rapidly. Broadening our product offering also helps us drive additional products through our distribution system, thereby increasing our scale and efficiency. 

Segment Strategy 

Grow Market Share 

We intend to grow our Building Materials Distribution business in existing markets by adding products and services to better serve our customers. We also plan to opportunistically expand our Building Materials Distribution business. Sales in our Building Materials Distribution segment are strongly correlated with new residential construction and residential improvements in the United States. We will continue to grow our Building Materials Distribution business by opportunistically acquiring facilities, adding new products, opening new locations, relocating and expanding capacity at existing facilities, and capturing local market share through our superior supply chain capabilities and customer service. 

Further Differentiate Our Products and Services 

We seek to continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a broad line of high-quality products and superior customer service. Our highly efficient logistics system and decentralized sales force allow us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital. Our national distribution platform, coupled with the manufacturing capabilities of our Wood Products segment, differentiates us from most of our competitors and is critical to servicing retail lumberyards, home improvement centers, and industrial accounts locally, regionally, and nationally. Additionally, this system allows us to procure product more efficiently and to develop and maintain stronger relationships with our vendors. Because of these relationships and our national presence, we believe many of our vendors have offered us favorable pricing and provide us with enhanced product introductions and ongoing marketing support. 

Corporate and Other 

Our Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services, related assets and liabilities, pension plan activity, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. These support services include, but are not limited to, finance, accounting, legal, information technology, and human resource functions. We purchased many of these corporate staff services, particularly accounting, information technology, and human resource functions, under an Outsourcing Services Agreement from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Packaging Corporation of America (PCA). On November 17, 2014, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to Outsourcing Services Agreement (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) with PCA, which amended the Outsourcing Services Agreement, dated February 22, 2008 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), to, among other things, provide expiration dates for the termination of substantially all administrative services provided by PCA to us pursuant to the Agreement. By the end of 2015, substantially all administrative services transitioned from PCA to us. Many of these services are being performed by newly hired employees, substantially all of whom transitioned from PCA to Boise Cascade upon termination of the Agreement. See Note 12, Outsourcing Services Agreement, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for more information. 

Customers 

We maintain relationships with a broad customer base across multiple market segments and various end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our top ten customers represented approximately 29% &#32;of our sales, with our largest customer, Home Depot, accounting for approximately 8% &#32;of our sales. At December 31, 2015 , receivables from Home Depot and Builders FirstSource each accounted for approximately 10% &#32;of total receivables. Sales to both Home Depot and Builders FirstSource were recorded in our Building Materials Distribution and Wood Products segments. For additional information related to customers of our Wood Products and Building Materials Distribution segments, see the "Sales, Marketing, and Distribution" sections above. 

&#32; 

Competition 

The competitive environment in the U.S. continues to be challenging as new residential and light commercial construction activity remain below the 30-year average. Industry capacity in a number of product markets, including some of those in which we compete, exceeds the current level of demand. Our products and services compete with similar products manufactured and distributed by others. Many factors influence our competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Those factors include price, service, quality, product selection, and convenience of location. 

Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. These resources may afford those competitors greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility, and more capital resources for expansion and improvement. 

Wood Products. &#32;&#32;&#32;The wood products manufacturing markets in which we operate are large and highly competitive. In plywood, we compete with Georgia-Pacific, the largest manufacturer in North America, other large producers such as Roseburg Forest Products, foreign imports produced principally in South America, and several smaller domestic producers. We also compete against several major North American EWP producers, such as Weyerhaeuser Company and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, as well as several other smaller firms. Our EWP products also face competition from numerous dimension lumber producers, because EWP may be substituted by dimension lumber in many building applications. We have leading market positions in the manufacture of plywood, EWP, and ponderosa pine lumber. We hold much smaller market positions in our other manufactured products. In the wood products manufacturing markets, we compete primarily on the basis of price, quality, and particularly with respect to EWP, levels of customer service. Most of our competitors are located in the United States (U.S.) and Canada, although we also compete with manufacturers in other countries, particularly when the U.S. dollar and economy are stronger relative to other countries, encouraging foreign producers to sell more of their plywood and lumber products into the U.S. Our competition includes not only manufacturers and distributors of similar building products but also manufacturers and distributors of products made from alternative materials, such as steel and plastic. Some of our competitors enjoy strong reputations for product quality and customer service, and these competitors may have strong relationships with certain distributors, making it more difficult for our products to gain additional market share. Some of our competitors in this segment are also vertically integrated and/or have access to internal sources of wood fiber, which may allow them to subsidize their base manufacturing business in periods of rising fiber prices. 

Building Materials Distribution. &#32;&#32;The building materials distribution markets in which we operate are highly fragmented, and we compete in each of our geographic and product markets with national, regional, and local distributors. Our national wholesale distribution competitors include BlueLinx Holdings Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company. Regional wholesale distribution competitors include Cedar Creek, OrePac, and U.S. Lumber Group. We also compete with wholesale brokers and certain buying cooperatives. We compete on the basis of pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist customers with problem solving, extension of credit terms, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. We also distribute products for some manufacturers that engage in direct sales. In recent years, there has been consolidation among retail lumberyards. As the customer base consolidates, this dynamic could affect our ability to maintain margins. Proximity to customers is an important factor in minimizing shipping costs and facilitating quick order turnaround and on-time delivery. We believe our ability to obtain quality materials, from both internal and external sources, the scale and efficiency of our national footprint, and our focus on customer service are our primary competitive advantages in this segment.
