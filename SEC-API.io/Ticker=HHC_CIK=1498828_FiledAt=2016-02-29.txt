 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

OVERVIEW 

Our mission is to be the preeminent developer of maste r planned communities and mixed- use properties. We create timeless places and extraordinary experiences that inspire people while driving sustainable, long-term growth and value for our shareholders. We specialize in the development of master planned communities (&#8220;MPCs&#8221;) , in the ownership, management and redevelopment of revenue- generating real estate assets &#160; (&#8220; Operating Assets &#8221;) , and in the development of other real estate assets in the form of entitled and unentitled land and residential condominium development s &#160; (&#8220; Strategic Developments &#8221;) . We expect to drive income from the growth of our operating asset portfolio, through continued strategic project opportunities , and from ongoing MPC land development and home site sales. We are focused on maximizing value from our assets, and we continue to acquire, develop and manage our assets t o achieve this goal. We are headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and our assets are located across the United States. 

In contrast to many publicly traded real estate companies which are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, we have no restrictions on our operating activities or the types of services that we can offer. We believe our structure provides the greatest flexibility for maximizing the value of our real estate portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated mortgage, notes and loans payable equaled approximately 42. 7 % of our total assets, and we had $ 445.3 million of cash on hand. 

&#160;

Our MPCs have won numerous awards for, among other things, design and community contribution. We expect the competitive position and desirable locations of our assets (which collectively comprise millions of square feet and thousands of acres of developable land), combined with their operations and long-term opportunity through entitlements, land, residential condominium and home site sales and project developments to drive our long-term growth. 

We were incorporated in Delaware in 2010. Through our predecessors, we have been in business for several decades. We operate our business in three segments: MPC , Operating Assets and Strategic Developments. Financial information about each of our segments is presented in Note 17 &#8211; Segments of our audited financial statemen ts on pages F-4 1 to F- 4 4 . 

Recent Significant Transactions 

The Club at Carlton Woods. On &#160; September 4, 2015, we sold The Club at &#160; Carlton Woods, the 36-hole golf and country club located in The Woodlands for net cash proceeds of $25.1 million and purchaser&#8217;s assumption of net liabilities of $4.0 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $29.1 million. &#160; We developed and operated the club as an amenity to help sell residential lots in a gated community. Most of the lots in the community have been sold , and the club had operating losses of $0.9 million and $4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. &#160; T he sale of this asset will allow us to redeploy capital to our development activities. 

Discover y J oint Venture. In the first quarter 2015, we entered into a joint venture with Discove ry Land Company (&#8220;Discovery &#8221;) by contributing undeveloped land at an agreed upon value of $125.4 million, or $226,000 per acre. Discovery is a leading developer of priva te clubs and luxury communities. The joint venture intends to develop an exclusive luxury community on approximately 555 acres of undeveloped land within our Summerlin MPC. The community is named The Summit and will have approximately 270 homes, an 18-hole Tom Fazio-designed golf course and other amenities for residents. Lot prices are expected to range from $2 million to $8 million. Discovery is the manager of the project and is responsible for funding development costs. The project will accelerate infrastructure improvements that will benefit our adjacent land, and accelerate s the monetization of this land significantly ahead of our prior development plans. Development began in the second quarter 2015 and the first lot sales are expected to begin closing in 2016. Please refer to Note 5 &#8211; &#160; Real Estate and Other Affiliates for further description of this joint venture. 

Seaport District Assemblage. During the first quarter 2015, we acquired a 58,000 square foot commercial building and air rights with total residential and commercial development rights of 196,133 square feet for $91.4 &#160; million. On December 29, 2014, in two separate transactions, we acquired a 48,000 square foot commercial building on a 15,744 square foot lot and certain air rights with total residential and commercial development rights of 621,651 square feet for $136.7 million. These combined acquisitions create a 42,694 square foot lot with 817,784 square feet of available development rights. These properties &#160; are collectively referred to as the Seaport District Assemblage and are located in close proximity to our South Street Seaport property. 

Tax Indemnity Settlement. On December 12, 2014, as part of a tax indemnity and &#160; mutual release agreement (the &#8220;Settlement A greement &#8221; ) with General Growth Properties, Inc. (&#8220;GGP&#8221;) for a release of GGP&#8217;s obligation for reimbursement of taxes related to sales of certain MPC assets during years in which those assets were owned by GGP (Please refer to Note 9 &#8211; Income Taxes ), we received $138.0 million in cash and six office buildings, referred to as 10-60 Columbia Corporate Center, consisting of 699,884 square feet located in downtown Columbia, Maryland valued at $130.0 million. 

On December 15, 2014, we made a payment totaling $203.3 million to the IRS in satisfaction of a judgment entered by the Tax Court in favor of the IRS with respect to the MPC taxes and filed an appeal of the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. T he court affirmed the Tax Court ruling on October 27, 2015; consequently, we will no longer use the &#160; completed contract method of tax accounting at our Summerlin MPC. All taxes and interest due related to this decision were paid when the appeal was filed. This ruling will accelerate the use of our tax attributes and change the timing of future tax payments. &#160; 

Overview of Business Segments 

The following describes our three business segments and provides a general description of each of the assets comprising these segments. This section should be referred to when reading &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; which contains financial and performance information for many of these assets. 

Master Planned Communities. Our Master Planned Communities segment includes the development and sale of residential and commercial land, primarily in large-scale long - term projects. Our five master planned communities , listed according to total acreage, &#160; are: The Woodlands, Summerlin, Maryland, Bridgeland and The Woodlands Hills. 

&#160;

Our master planned communities include over 12,000 acres of land remaining to be developed or sold. Residential sales, which are made primarily to homebuilders, include standard and custom parcels designated for detached and attached single and multi-family homes, ranging from entry-level to luxury homes. Commercial sales include land parcels designated for retail, office, resort, high density residential projects (e.g., condominiums and apartments), services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels designated for use by government, schools and other not-for-profit entities . Our strategy is to retain commercial land &#160; for our own development unless we deem its intended use will not compete with our existing assets and current development plans . 

Operating Assets. Our Oper ating Assets segment contains 5 2 &#160; properties , investments and oth er assets that generate revenue, consisting of retail, office, multi-fami ly and hospitality properties. Including properties in joint ventures, t his segment includes 13 retail properties , 2 3 office properties, five &#160; multi-family buildings, two hospitality assets, and nine other operating assets and investments. We believe that there are opportunities to redevelop or reposition certain of these assets &#160; to increase operating performance, including &#160; several retail properties and some of the office propertie s located in Columbia , Maryland . These opportunities will require new capital investment and vary in complexity and scale. The redevelopment opportunities range from minimal disruption to the property to the partial or full demolition of existing structures for new construction. 

Strategic Developments. Our Strategic Developments segment consists of 26 development projects. We believe most of these assets will require substantial future development to achieve their highest and best use. We are in various stages of creating or executing strategic plans for many of these assets based on market conditions and availability of capital. As of December 31, 2015, we had nine properties under construction and not yet placed into service, representing total estimated aggregate project costs totaling $1. 6 billion . These projects include one Operating Asset , South Street Seaport, that is undergoing redevelopment and one multi-family property being developed in a joint venture. In addition to the permitting and approval process required in almost all large-scale real estate developments of this nature, we generally obtain construction financing to fund a majority of the costs associated with developing these assets.

Master Planned Communities 

The development of master planned communities requires expertise in large-scale and long-range land use planning, residential and commercial real estate development and sales. These developments often require decades of investment and continual focus on the changing market dynamics surrounding the communities. We believe that the long-term value of our master planned communities remains strong because of their competitive positioning in their respective markets, our expertise and flexibility in land use planning and the fact that we have substantially completed the entitlement processes within the majority of our communities. 

Our MPC segment consists of the development and sale of residential land and the development of commercial land to hold, develop or sell. Our master planned communities are located in and around Houston, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Columbia, Maryland. Residential revenues are generated primarily from the sale of finished lots and undeveloped superpads to residential homebuilders and developers. We also occasionally sell or lease land for commercial development when we deem its use will not compete with our existing properties or our strategy. Superpad sites are generally 20 to 25 acre parcels of unimproved land where we develop and construct the major utilities (water, sewer and storm drain) and roads to the borders of the parcel and the homebuilder completes the on-site utilities, roads and finished lots. Revenue is also generated through price participation with homebuilders. Revenues, net income and our ability to execute planned development are affected by factors such as: (1) the availability of construction and permanent mortgage financing to purchasers at acceptable interest rates; (2) consumer and business confidence; (3) regional economic conditions in the areas surrounding the projects, which includes levels of employment and homebuilder inventory; (4) availability of saleable land for particular uses; (5) our decisions to sell, develop or retain land; and (6) other factors generally affecting the homebuilder business and sales of residential properties. 

The following table summarizes our master planned communities, all of which are wholly-owned as of December 31, 2015:

(a) 

Encompasses all of the land located within the borders of the master planned community, including parcels already sold, saleable parcels and non-saleable areas such as roads, parks and recreation areas, conservation areas and parcels acquired during the year. 

(b) 

Includes standard, custom and high density residential land parcels. Standard residential lots are designed for detached and attached single and multi-family homes, ranging from entry-level to luxury homes. Certain residential parcels are designated as custom lots as their premium price reflects a larger size and other distinguishing features such as location within a gated community, having golf course access or higher elevations. High density residential includes townhomes and condominiums. 

(c) 

Designated for retail, office, resort, services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels allocated for use by government, schools, houses of worship and other not-for-profit entities. 

(d) 

Remaining S aleable Residential L ots are estimates and include only lots that are intended for sale or joint venture. The mix of intended use on our remaining saleable and developable acres is primarily based on assumptions regarding entitlements and zoning of the remaining project and are likely to change over time as the master plan is refined. 

(e) 

Remaining Saleable Residential Lots may decrease based on a revised land plan that is being finalized as of February 2016 . 

(f) 

Amount represents remaining entitlements, not necessarily the number of lots that will ultimately be developed and sold.

Formerly known as the Conroe MPC. Total gross acres include 61 acres of land under contract to be acquired for $2.5 million in 201 6 . 

&#160;

Houston, Texas MPCs 

Bridgeland 

Bridgeland was recognized as the 2015 Community of the Year by the Texas Association of Builders and received numerous awards at the 2015 Greater Houston Builders Association PRISM ceremony. The first residents moved into their homes in June 2006. When fully developed, we expect Bridgeland will contain more than 3,000 acres of waterways, lakes, trails, parks and open spaces, as well as an expansive Town Center that will provide employment and land for retail, educational and entertainment facilities. The MPC is being developed to eventually accommodate approximately 20,000 homes and 65,000 residents. 

Bridgeland&#8217;s conceptual plan includes four villages, Lakeland Village, Parkland Village, Prairieland Village and Creekland Village, a 900-acre Town Center mixed-use district and a carefully designed network of trails totaling over 60 miles that will provide pedestrian connectivity to distinct residential villages and neighborhoods and access to recreational, educational, cultural, employment, retail, religious and other offerings. The Town Center will be located adjacent to the Grand Parkway, a 180-mile circumferential highway traversing seven counties and encircling the Greater Houston region, providing direct access to the Town Center and to future residential sections of Bridgeland. Additional segments of the Grand Parkway were completed in February 2016 and now connect Bridgeland to The Woodlands, the new ExxonMobil Campus and Houston&#8217;s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The Woodlands senior management team members , each of which have over 2 0 years of experience developin g master planned communities, are leading the development and marketing of Bridgeland. 

Bridgeland&#8217;s first five neighborhoods are located in Lakeland Village, which totals 2,275 acres and has many home sites that have views of the water, buried power lines to maximize the views of open space, fiber-optic technology, brick-lined terrace walkways and brick, stone and timber architecture. The prices of the homes range from approximately $250,000 to more than $1.0 million. Lakeland Village is approximately 85% complete and is anchored by a 6,000 square foot community center that features a water park with three swimming pools, two lighted tennis courts and a state-of-the-art fitness room. We are currently developing Lakeland Village Center, our first retail property in Bridgeland, which will be completed in the second quarter 2016. A grand promenade wrapping around Lake Bridgeland offers a boat dock, canoes, kayaks, sailboats and paddleboats. Design work is underway for Parkland Village, which totals 1,842 acres and will be the next phase of our development as Lakeland Village reaches b uild-out. Bridgeland has approximately 2,300 homes occupied by approximately 7,800 residents as of December 31, 2015. 

The Woodlands &#160; 

The Woodlands is a mixed-use, self-contained master planned community approximately 1.5 times the size of Manhattan, New York, located 27 miles north of Houston, Texas. The Woodlands provides an exceptional lifestyle and integrates recreational amenities, residential neighborhoods, commercial office space, retail shops and entertainment venues. Approximately 28% of The Woodlands is dedicated to green space, including parks, pathways, open spaces, golf courses and forest preserves. 

The Woodlands has consistently ranked as one of the top master planned communities in the nation with regard to annual home sales. During its 41-year history, The Woodlands has won numerous awards, most recently being recognized as the Master Planned Community of the Year in 2015 by the Greater Houston Builders Association (GHBA), which is GHBA&#8217;s most coveted award. The Woodlands has led the way among master planned communities that practice environmental preservation. 

Home site sales began in 1974. To maximize long term values, the development started with residential activity with land reserved for the eventual development of a town center containing office, retail, multi-family and hotel properties to serve the residents. Over time, the residential success created demand for commercial development. In recent years, the commercial and residential components have achieved significant appreciation in values and acceleration of development. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that we own most of the undeveloped available land in The Woodlands, we have substantial influence over the market. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 41,850 homes occupied by approximately 112,0 00 residents and approximately 2,180 businesses providing employment for approximately 63,0 00 people. The population is projected to increase to approximately 131,0 00 by 202 5 . We estimate that The Woodlands has a jobs to home ratio of approximately 1. 5 to 1.0. This ratio implies that many residents also work within The Woodlands, making it a more attractive place to live compared to purely residential communities by improving quality of life through short commute times. Since its inception, The 

&#160;

Woodlands has sought to maintain a wide array of home choices and marketed that information to the realtor community as it is critical in providing guidance to the corporate relocation homebuyer. As a result of this effort, over the last ten years, The Woodlands has achieved an average of approximately 4 2 % of new home sales attributable to &#8220;Outside of Houston Area&#8221; residents. &#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, The Woodlands had 78 5 acres of land designated for commercial use remaining to be sold or developed. The Woodlands is well positioned to compete against other commercial developers in the area because we have the largest inventory of vacant commercial land available in the area and we offer virtually every product type being sought by our customers. We plan to develop most, if not all, of the future office, retail and apartment sites ourselves; however, some sites will be sold or ground leased to third parties for their own use when a compelling strategic or financial ly opportunistic &#160; reason exists to sell or lease the land. Examples include institut ional projects such as churches, schools and medical facilities, including hospitals, medical office buildings, nursing homes and emergency clinics. Other uses that will in all likelihood be sold or leased include free standing fast food sites, gas station sites and day care sites. The mix of acreage designated for development versus sale or lease may change over time based on market conditions, projected demand, our view of the economic benefits of developing or selling and other factors. 

The Woodlands has full or partial ownership interests in commercial properties totaling approximately 2.1 million square feet of office space (of which 1.8 million square feet are complete and 320,000 square feet are under construction), 437,821 square feet of retail and service space, 1,097 rental apartment units and 1,320 self-storage units ( under construction ) . We also own and operate a 406-room resort and conference center facility, a 205-room Embassy Suites and &#160; a 302-room Westin Hotel (under construction). The Westin is scheduled to open in March 2016 and the Embassy Suites opened on December 30, 2015. These commercial properties are more fully des cribed under &#8220;Operating Assets.&#8221; 

We believe the completion of The Grand Parkway linking The Woodlands and Bridgeland to the new ExxonMobil campus and the rest of the greater Houston area will be a further catalyst to attracting potential residents to our Houston master planned communities. Construction of the segments of The Grand Parkway that serve The Woodlands and Bridgeland was completed in February 2016. 

The Woodlands Hills (formerly Conroe MPC) 

Many of Houston&#8217;s prominent master planned communities are approaching build-out with few new communities to replace them. As such, we believe that there is a significant opportunity to introduce another master planned community in the Far North Houston submarket. The demand for this site was validated by research/demand studies from Robert Charles Lesser and Co. and MetroStudy, two well-known residential and commercial consulting firms. &#160; 

The current land development plan for The Woodlands Hills includes 2,116 acres, of which 2,055 acres were acquired in 2014 and another 61 acres are under contract to close in 2016. The land plan includes 1,493 acres dedicated to residential lot development and 171 acres dedicated to commercial and institutional land development. Planning for site development was underway during 2015, and we currently expect to begin water, sewer and drainage construction in the third quarter 2016 with the first lots sold in the fourth quarter 2017. 

The Woodlands Hills &#160; is well positioned to take advantage of its location, within the path of future development along I-45 north of The Woodlands and its close proximity to the ExxonMobil campus . In addition, the new master planned community benefits from several east-west thoroughfares that provide convenient access to local and regional destinations such as Lake Conroe. &#160; We expect to deliver an amenity package to appeal to families . The amenities will include a park , village centers, pathways and common areas . The clubhouse will open in 2017 and serve as a marketing tool f o r the community. Commercial developments will be incorporated over time similar to Creekside Village Green in The Woodlands. The terrain features rolling hills and dense tree cover, appropriate for utilizing the reputation and brand of The Woodlands. 

Maryland (Howard County, Maryland) 

The Maryland community has no more remaining acreage for single family homes and represents primarily a commercial real estate development opportunity. It consists of four distinct communities known as Columbia, Gateway, Emerson and Fairwood. Columbia is the largest community and also where we believe the greatest commercial real estate development potential exists. &#160; 

&#160;

Columbia 

Columbia, located i n Howard County , Maryland, is an internationally recognized model of a successful master planned community that began development in the 1960&#8217;s. Located between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and encompassing 14,200 acres of land, Columbia offers a wide variety of living, business and recreational opportunities. The master planned community&#8217;s full range of housing options is located in nine distinct, self-contained villages and a Town Cente r. Columbia has an estimated 5,0 00 businesses, which occupy approximately 22.9 million square feet of space and provide more than 73 ,000 jobs. There is a wide variety of retail option s encompassing approximately 8.0 million square feet of reta il space . 

In 2015, we began development of the Merriweather District and approximately 35 acres were transferred to our Strategic Developments segment. Please refer to our Strategic Developments section for our development plans relating to this acreage. Approximately 40 acres of additional undevelopable land remains in Columbia. 

Gateway/Emerson/Fairwood 

The remaining three communities (Gateway, Emerson and Fairwood) consist of 2,250 acres, with 108 acres remaining to be sold, all of which are entitled for commercial development. In addition, Fairwood own s a few undedicated open space parcels and 24 acres of unsubdivided land which cannot be developed as long as the nearby airport is operating. 

Summerlin (Las Vegas, Nevada) 

Spanning the western rim of the Las Vegas Valley and located approximately nine miles from downtown Las Vegas, our Summerlin Master Planned Community is comprised of planned and developed villages and offers suburban living with accessibility to the Las Vegas Strip. For much of its 2 6 -year history, Summerlin has consistently ranked in the Robert Charles Lesser annual poll of Top-Selling Master Planned Communities in the nation, ranking 6 th for 2015. With 23 public and private schools (K-12), four institutions of higher learning, nine golf courses, cultural facilities and health and medical centers, Summerlin is a fully integrated community. The first residents moved into their homes in 1991. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 41,800 homes in Summerlin . Summerlin&#8217;s population is expected to exceed 200,000 residents upon sell-out . 

Summerlin is comprised of hundreds of neighborhoods located in 20 developed villages, out of 30 planned, with more than 150 parks that are all connected by a 150-mile long trail system. Summerlin is located adjacent to the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, which has become a world-class hiking and rock climbing destination and attracts more than one million visitors annually. Summerlin contains approximately 2.1 million square feet of developed retail space and 3.3 million square feet of developed office space, in addition to the approximately 1.4 million square feet of retail and office space comprising our Downtown Summerlin development . In addition, there are three hotel properties owned by third parties containing approximately 1,400 hotel rooms within the MPC. The Downtown Summerlin &#160; area contains approximately 400 acres designated for residential and commercial development. We own approximately 300 acres of this land with the remaining acreage anchored by The Red Rock Casino, Resort &#38; Spa and Life Time Fitness. Our Downtown Summerlin development opened in October 2014 and 90.6% of the retail space was leased as of February 1, 2016. We believe that the opening of this project has significantly increase d the desirability and value of our surrounding land due to the addition of retail, office, restaurant and entertainment amenities. Please refer to Downtown Summerlin under &#8220;Operating Assets&#8221; for a more complete description of this development. 

Summerlin is divided into three separate regions known as Summerlin South, Summerlin West and Summerlin North . In Summerlin South, we are entitled to develop 740 acres of commercial property with no square footage restrictions, 493 o f such acres, including our 106- acre Downtown Summerlin project, are either developed or committed to commercial development. The remaining 247 acres are under our control for future commercial development. We also have entitlements for an additional 17,000 residential units yet to be developed in Summerlin South. In Summerlin West, we are entitled to develop 5.85 million square feet of comm ercial space on up to 508 acres of which 100,000 square feet has already been developed into a grocery store anchored shopping center. We are also entitled to develop 30,000 residential units in Summerlin West . &#160; A pproximately 7,000 units are existing homes or lots already sold to homebuilders, and 23,000 o f which remain to be developed. The remaining 40,000 saleable residential lots represent Summerlin&#8217;s total entitlements, and utilization of these entitlements will be based on current and forecasted economic conditions. &#160; Summerlin North is fully developed and sold out. &#160;

Operating Assets 

In our Operating Assets segment, we own a variety of asset types including retail, office, multi-family, hospitality and other assets and investments that generate revenue. Many of these assets have been developed by us since our spin-off in 2010. For certain of the remaining assets, &#160; primarily several of our retail properties and the Columbia office properties, we believe that there are opportunities to improve their operating performance through redevelopment or repositioning. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) existing and forecasted demographics surrounding the property; (2) competition related to existing and/or alternative uses; (3) existing entitlements of the property and our ability to change them; (4) compatibility of the physical site with proposed uses; and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the properties. We believe that, subject to obtaining all necessary consents and approvals, these assets have the potential for future growth by means of an improved tenant mix, additional gross leasable area (&#8220;GLA&#8221;), or repositioning of the asset for alternative use. Redevelopment plans for these assets may include office, retail or residential space, shopping centers, movie theaters, parking complexes and open space. Any future redevelopment may require that we obtain permits, licenses, consents and/or waivers from various parties. Our Operating Assets portfolio includes approximately 6.9 million square feet of retail and office, 804 wholly-owned multi-family units, 611 combined keys at hospitality properties, and other properties and investments as detailed on the following pages. This section contains a general description of each of the assets contained in our Operating Assets segment. For a detailed discussion of the financial performance of our Operating Assets please refer to &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;

Within Phase I we are developing plans for approximately 275,000 square feet of new retail space, including an upscale dine-in movie theater and up to 400 residential units. Prior to the commencement of construction, we must achieve internal pre-leasing targets, obtain building permits from the City of Alexandria, and consents from Macy&#8217;s and Sears.

The Seaport District (New York, New York) 

The Seaport District includes the entire South Street Seaport, encompasses the historic waterfront along the East River, and is bounded by the Brooklyn Bridge on the north, Wall Street on the south and Water Street on the west. The South Street Seaport is currently comprised of land and buildings located in an area we call the historic area and Pier 17. A significant portion of the property is subject to ground leases with the City of New York that expire in 2072. The historic area , (which is west of the FDR Drive) includes retail space in five buildings. Pier 17 is located east of FDR Drive and is under construction. Upon completion of the Seaport District First Project, as described below, South Street Seaport will have approximately 362,000 square feet of leasable space , substantially all of which will be retail , res taurant and entertainment areas . The South Street Seaport is being rebranded to include the larger Seaport District as the company begins to reintroduce The Seaport District to New York City as the city&#8217;s Oldest New Neighborhood. 

Seaport District First Project 

In 2013, the City of New York executed the amended and restated ground lease for South Street Seaport and we provided a completion guarantee to New York City for the renovation and reconstruction of the existing Pier 17 Building (&#8220;Renovation Project&#8221;). Construction began in 2013 and is expected to conclude in 2017. The Renovation Project features a newly constructed pier and building and is designed to include upscale retail, restaurants and an outdoor entertainment venue in a vibrant open rooftop encompassing approximately 1.5 acres. The new Pier 17 building will be anchored by our partner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten who will open a flagship restaurant on the pier and, as part of the Second Project a s described below, a food market in the adjacent to-be-reconstructed Tin Building. Additionally, we are repositioning a significant portion of the 180,000 square feet of retail space in the historic area. We entered into a 20-year lease with iPic Entertainment for 46,000 square feet in the Fulton Market Building located in the historic area. iPic Theatres will serve as an anchor attraction for residents, workers and tourists, and we expect the historic area to be substantially repositioned by the end of 2016. 

Seaport District Second Project 

We began the public approval process on December 10, 2014 for our further redevelopment of the Seaport District, including up to approximately 700,000 square feet of additional space. During 2015, we halted the process due to a lack of community support for our initial proposal. Discussions regarding the location of the added development space are ongoing with the various interested parties. Separately, we have proposed a Minor Modification of the 2013 ULURP Approval for Pier 17 and the reconstruction of the Tin Building. This Pier 17 Minor Modification includes the demolition of the Link Building and head house structure for the Pier 17 building, completion of the previously approved fa&#231;ade treatment along the western elevation of the building, and the installation of a reconfigured access drive. The Tin Building reconstruction includes cataloguing important historical elements of the Tin Building, deconstructing the Tin Building, demolishing and reconstructing the platform pier and then reconstructing the Tin Building. Finally, the access drive would be extended around the Tin Building to create a one-way access drive for service and vehicular circulation. We have previously announced that we have entered into a JV Partnership with Jean-Georges Vongerichten to operate a food market in the reconstructed Tin Building. We are still processing the necessary approval to move forward with the Pier 17 Minor Modifications and the Tin Building reconstruction and there can be no assurance that we will ultimately obtain the entitlements needed to move forward with this project.

&#160; 

Competition 

The nature and extent of our competition depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our master planned communities segment, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers in the development of properties within Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas and the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. markets. Significant factors which we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include: 

&#183; 

the size and scope of our master planned communities; 

&#183; 

years of experience serving the industry; 

&#183; 

the recreational and cultural amenities available within the communities; 

&#183; 

the commercial centers in the communities, including the retail properties that we own and/or operate or may develop; 

&#183; 

our relationships with homebuilders; 

&#183; 

our level of debt relative to total assets; and 

&#183; 

the proximity of our developments to major metropolitan areas. 

With respect to our Operating Assets segment, we primarily compete for retail and office tenants, and to a lesser extent, residential tenants. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include: (1) consumer demographics; (2) age, quality, design and location of properties; (3) neighboring real estate projects that have been developed by our predecessors or that we, in the future, may develop; (4) diversity of retailers and anchor tenants at shopping center locations; (5) management and operational expertise; and (6) rental rates. 

With respect to our Strategic Developments segment, our direct competitors include other commercial property developers, retail mall development and operating companies , residential condominium developers and other owners of commercial real estate that engage in similar businesses. 

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell such real estate or to obtain financing using such real estate as collateral. 

&#160;

Substantially all of our properties have been subject to Phase I environmental assessments, which are intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the surveyed and surrounding properties. As of December 31, 201 5 , the assessments have not revealed any known environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that these assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that the conditions have changed since the assessments were prepared (typically at the time the property was purchased or encumbered with debt). Moreover, no assurances can be given that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be adversely affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties (such as the presence on such properties of underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to us. 

Future development opportunities may require additional capital and other expenditures to comply with federal, state and local statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In addition, there is a risk when redeveloping sites, that we might encounter previously unknown issues that require remediation or residual contamination warranting special handling or disposal, which could affect the speed of redevelopment. Where redevelopment involves renovating or demolishing existing facilities, we may be required to undertake abatement and/or the removal and disposal of building materials or other remediation or cleanup activities that contain hazardous materials. We cannot predict with any certainty the magnitude of any such expenditures or the long-range effect, if any, on our operations. Compliance with such laws has not had a material adverse effect on our current or past operating results or competitive position, but could have such an effect on our operating results or competitive position in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,000 employees.
