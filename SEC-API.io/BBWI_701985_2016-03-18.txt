Our Strengths 

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth: 

Industry Leading Brands 

We believe that our three flagship brands, Victoria&#8217;s Secret, PINK and Bath &#38; Body Works, are highly recognized and others, including La Senza and Henri Bendel, exhibit brand recognition which provides us with a competitive advantage. These brands are aspirational at accessible price points and have a loyal customer base. These brands allow us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. 

&#8226; 

At Victoria&#8217;s Secret, we market glamorous and sexy product lines to our customers, such as Body by Victoria, Angels and Very Sexy. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in loungewear, accessories, fragrances, personal care, swimwear and athletic attire. 

&#8226; 

At PINK, we market products to the college-aged woman. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in loungewear, accessories, fragrances, personal care, swimwear and athletic attire. 

&#8226; 

Bath &#38; Body Works caters to our customers&#8217; entire well-being, providing shower gels and lotions, aromatherapy, soaps and sanitizers, home fragrance and personal care accessories. 

In-Store Experience and Store Operations 

We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of each brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by the brands. 

Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture, fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. Every brand displays merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the company-wide merchandising strategy. 

Our sales associates and managers are a central element in creating the atmosphere of the stores by providing a high level of customer service. 

Product Development, Sourcing and Logistics 

We believe a large part of our success comes from frequent and innovative product launches, which include bra launches at Victoria&#8217;s Secret and La Senza and new fragrance launches at Bath &#38; Body Works. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative products to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our sourcing function (Mast Global) has a long and deep presence in the key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia, which helps us partner with the best manufacturers and get high-quality products quickly. 

Experienced and Committed Management Team 

We were founded in 1963 and have been led since inception by Leslie H. Wexner. Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience at L Brands, Inc. and other companies such as The Gap, Inc., The Home Depot, Land's End, Levi Strauss and Yum Brands. We believe that we have one of the most experienced management teams in retail. 

Additional Information 

Merchandise Suppliers 

During 2015 , we purchased merchandise from approximately 400 &#32;suppliers located throughout the world. No supplier provided 10% &#32;or more of our merchandise purchases. 

&#32;3 

Distribution and Merchandise Inventory 

Most of our merchandise is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination. 

Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current. 

Information Systems 

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance. We continue to invest in technology to upgrade core systems to continue to improve our efficiency and accuracy in the production and delivery of merchandise to our stores. 

Seasonal Business 

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;and is typically our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. 

Working Capital 

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. 

Regulation 

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements. 

Trademarks and Patents 

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement. 

Segment Information 

We have three reportable segments: Victoria&#8217;s Secret, Bath &#38; Body Works and Victoria's Secret and Bath &#38; Body Works International. For additional information, including the financial results of our reportable segments, see Note 19 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 . Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Other Information 

For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, see Item 7 . Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Competition 

The sale of women&#8217;s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our online businesses compete with numerous online merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in online sales. 

&#32;4 

Associate Relations 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 87,900 &#32;associates; 65,000 &#32;of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.
