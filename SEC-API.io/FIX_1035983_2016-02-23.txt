 ITEM 1. Business 

Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was established in 1997. We provide comprehensive mechanical contracting services, which principally includes heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC"), plumbing, piping and controls, as well as off-site construction, electrical, monitoring and fire protection. We install, maintain, repair and replace products and systems throughout our 35 operating units in 81 cities and 89 locations throughout the United States. 

We operate primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional HVAC markets and perform most of our services in industrial, healthcare, education, office, technology, retail and government facilities. Approximately 99% of our consolidated 2015 revenue was derived from commercial, industrial and institutional customers and multi-family residential projects. Approximately 44% of our revenue was attributable to installation services in newly constructed facilities and 56% was attributable to renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services in existing buildings. Our consolidated 2015 revenue was derived from the following service activities, substantially all of which are in the mechanical services industry, the single industry segment we serve:

Industry Overview 

We believe that the commercial, industrial, and institutional mechanical contracting generates annual revenue in the United States of approximately $100 billion. Mechanical systems are necessary to virtually all commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. Because most buildings are sealed, HVAC systems provide the primary method of circulating fresh air in such buildings. In many instances, replacing an aging building's existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building's operating costs while improving air quality and overall system effectiveness. Older commercial, industrial and institutional facilities often have poor air quality as well as inadequate air conditioning, and older HVAC systems result in significantly higher energy costs than do modern systems. 

Many factors positively affect mechanical services industry growth, particularly (i) population growth, which increases the need for commercial, industrial and institutional space, (ii) an aging installed base of buildings and equipment, (iii) increasing sophistication, complexity and efficiency of mechanical systems, and (iv) growing emphasis on environmental and energy efficiency. 

Our industry can be broadly divided into two categories: 

&#149; construction of and installation in new buildings, which provided approximately 44% of our revenue in 2015, and &#149; renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement in existing buildings, which provided the remaining 56% of our 2015 revenue. Construction, Installation, Expansion and Renovation Services &#151;Construction, installation, expansion and renovation services consist of "design and build" and "plan and spec" projects. In "design and build" projects, the commercial HVAC company is responsible for designing, engineering and installing a cost-effective, energy-efficient system customized to the specific needs of the building owner. Costs and other project terms are normally negotiated between the building owner or its representative and the contracting company. Companies that specialize in "design and build" projects generally have specially trained HVAC engineers, CAD/CAM design systems and in-house sheet metal and prefabrication capabilities. These companies use a consultative approach with customers and tend to develop long-term relationships with building owners and developers, general contractors, architects, consulting engineers and property managers. "Plan and spec" installation refers to projects in which a third-party architect or consulting engineer designs the HVAC systems and the installation project is "put out for bid." We believe that "plan and spec" projects usually take longer to complete than "design and build" projects because the system design and installation process generally are not integrated, thus resulting in more frequent adjustments to the technical specifications of the project and corresponding changes in work requirements and schedules. Furthermore, in "plan and spec" projects, the contracting company is not responsible for project design and other parties must also approve any changes, thereby increasing overall project time and cost. 

Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Services &#151;These services include maintaining, repairing, replacing, reconfiguring and monitoring previously installed systems and building automation controls. The growth and aging of the installed base of HVAC and related systems, and the demand for more efficient and sophisticated systems and building automation controls have fueled growth in these services. The increasing complexity of these systems is leading many commercial, industrial and institutional building owners and property managers to increase attention to maintenance and to outsource maintenance and repair, often through service agreements with service providers. State-of-the-art control and monitoring systems feature electronic sensors and microprocessors. These systems require specialized training to install, maintain and repair. Increasingly, mechanical systems in commercial, industrial and institutional buildings are being remotely monitored to improve energy efficiency and expedite problem diagnosis and correction, thereby allowing us to provide maintenance and repair services at a lower cost. 

Strategy 

We focus on strengthening operating competencies and on increasing profit margins. The key objectives of our strategy are to generate growth in our operations, improve the productivity of our workforce and to acquire complementing businesses. In order to accomplish our objectives we are currently focused on the following elements: 

Achieve Excellence in Core Competencies &#151;We have identified six core competencies that we believe are critical to attracting and retaining customers, increasing operating income and cash flow and maximizing the productivity of our increasingly valuable skilled labor force. The six core competencies are: (i) customer cultivation and rapport, (ii) design and build expertise, (iii) estimating, (iv) job and cost tracking, (v) safety, and (vi) service excellence. 

Achieve Operating Efficiencies &#151;We think we can achieve operating efficiencies and cost savings through purchasing economies, adopting "best practices" operating programs, and focusing on job management to deliver services in a cost-effective and efficient manner. We have placed great emphasis on improving the "job loop" at our locations&#151;qualifying, estimating, pricing and executing projects effectively and efficiently, then promptly assessing project experience for applicability to current and future projects. We also use our combined purchasing to gain volume discounts on products and services such as HVAC components, raw materials, services, vehicles, bonding, insurance and employee benefits. 

Attract, Retain and Invest in our Employees &#151;We seek to attract and retain quality employees by providing them an enhanced career path from working for a larger company, the opportunity to realize a more stable income and attractive benefits packages. We have increased our already substantial investments in training, including programs for project managers, field superintendents, service managers, sales managers, estimators, and leadership and development of key managers and leaders. 

Focus on Commercial, Industrial and Institutional Markets &#151;We primarily focus on the commercial, industrial and institutional markets, including construction, maintenance, repair and replacement services. We believe that the commercial, industrial and institutional HVAC markets are attractive because of their growth opportunities, large and diverse customer base, attractive margins and potential for long-term relationships with building owners, property managers, general contractors and architects. Approximately 99% of our consolidated 2015 revenue was derived from commercial, industrial and institutional customers and large multi-family residential projects. 

Leveraging Resources and Capabilities &#151;We believe significant operating efficiencies can be achieved by leveraging resources among our operating locations. For example, we have shifted certain fabrication activities into centralized locations in order to increase asset utilization. We opportunistically allocate our engineering, field and supervisory labor from one operation to another to more fully use our 

employee base, meet our customers' needs and share expertise. We believe we have realized scale benefits from combining purchasing, insurance, benefits, bonding and financing activities across our operations. 

Maintain a Diverse Customer, Geographic and Project Base &#151;We have a distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector. We also have significant geographical diversification across all regions of the United States, again reducing our exposure to negative developments in any given region. Our distribution of revenue in 2015 by end-use sector was as follows: 

Industrial and Manufacturing &#160; &#160; 21 % Education &#160; &#160; 15 % Office Buildings &#160; &#160; 13 % Healthcare &#160; &#160; 11 % Government &#160; &#160; 10 % Retail and Restaurants &#160; &#160; 7 % Technology &#160; &#160; 7 % Multi-Family &#160; &#160; 5 % Lodging and Entertainment &#160; &#160; 5 % Distribution &#160; &#160; 2 % Religious and Not for profit &#160; &#160; 1 % Residential &#160; &#160; 1 % Other &#160; &#160; 2 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 100 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

Approximately 82% of our revenue is earned on a project basis for installation of systems in newly constructed or existing facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,843 projects in process with an aggregate contract value of approximately $1,966.4 million. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately $512,000. This average project size, when taken together with the approximately 18% of our revenue derived from maintenance and service, provides us with a broad base of work in the construction services sector. A stratification of projects in progress as of December 31, 2015, by contract price, is as follows: 

Contract Price of Project 

&#160; No. of Projects &#160; Aggregate Contract Price Value (millions) &#160; Under $1 million &#160; &#160; 3,460 &#160; $ 401.4 &#160; $1 million - $5 million &#160; &#160; 286 &#160; &#160; 638.7 &#160; $5 million - $10 million &#160; &#160; 64 &#160; &#160; 428.5 &#160; $10 million - $15 million &#160; &#160; 21 &#160; &#160; 252.0 &#160; Greater than $15 million &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; 245.8 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 3,843 &#160; $ 1,966.4 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

Strategic Service Initiative. Over the last two years we have made substantial incremental investments to expand our service and maintenance revenue by increasing the value we can offer to service and maintenance customers. We are actively concentrating existing and new managerial and sales resources on training and hiring experienced employees to sell and profitably perform service work. In many locations we have added or upgraded our capability, and we believe our investments and efforts are providing a compelling customer value offering that will ultimately stimulate growth in all aspects of our construction, renovation, service, and maintenance and repair businesses. 

Seek Growth through Expansion and Acquisitions &#151;We believe that we can increase our cash flow and operating income by opportunistically entering new markets or service lines through expansion and acquisition. We have dedicated a significant portion of our cash flow to seeking opportunities to acquire businesses that have attractive capabilities and meet other criteria involving valuation, financial, operational, management, growth and geographic considerations. 

Operations and Services Provided 

We provide a wide range of construction, renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services for mechanical and related systems in commercial, industrial and institutional properties. Our local management teams maintain responsibility for day-to-day operating decisions. Local management is augmented by regional leadership that focuses on core business competencies, regional financial performance, cooperation and coordination between locations, implementing best practices and corporate initiatives. In addition to senior management, local personnel generally include design engineers, sales personnel, customer service personnel, installation and service technicians, sheet metal and prefabrication technicians, estimators and administrative personnel. We have centralized certain administrative functions such as insurance, employee benefits, training, safety programs, marketing and cash management to enable our local operating management to focus on pursuing new business opportunities and improving operating efficiencies. We also combine certain back office and administrative functions at various locations. 

Construction and Installation Services for New Buildings &#151;Our installation business related to newly constructed facilities, which comprised approximately 44% of our consolidated 2015 revenue, involves the design, engineering, integration, installation and start-up of mechanical and related systems. We provide "design and build" and "plan and spec" installation services for office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, manufacturing plants, healthcare, education and government facilities and other commercial, industrial and institutional facilities. In a "design and build" installation, working with the customer, we determine the needed capacity and energy efficiency of the HVAC system that best suits the proposed facility. We estimate the amount of time, labor, materials and equipment needed to build the specified system. The final design, terms, price and timing of the project are then negotiated with the customer or its representatives, after which any necessary modifications are made to the system plan. In "plan and spec" installation, we participate in a bid process to provide labor, equipment, materials and installation based on the end user's plans and engineering specifications. 

Once an agreement has been reached, we order the necessary materials and equipment for delivery to meet the project schedule. In many instances, we fabricate ductwork and piping and assemble certain components for the system based on the mechanical drawing specifications, eliminating the need to subcontract ductwork or piping fabrication. Finally, we install the system at the project site, working closely with the owner or general contractor. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately $512,000. We also perform larger project work, with 383 contracts in progress at December 31, 2015 with contract prices in excess of $1 million. Our largest project in progress at December 31, 2015 had a contract price of $24.7 million. Project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project. Project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work, typically for six months. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage. 

Renovation, Expansion, Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Services for Existing Buildings &#151;Our renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services in existing buildings comprised approximately 56% of our consolidated 2015 revenue and include the maintenance, repair, replacement, renovation, expansion, reconfiguration and monitoring of mechanical systems including HVAC systems and industrial process piping. Approximately 68% of our maintenance, repair and replacement revenue were derived from renovation, expansion, replacement and reconfiguration of existing systems for 

commercial, industrial and institutional customers. Renovation, expansion, replacement and reconfiguration services are typically performed on a project basis and frequently use consultative expertise similar to that provided in the "design and build" installation market. 

Maintenance and repair services are provided either in response to service calls or under a service agreement. Service calls are coordinated by customer service representatives or dispatchers that use computer and communication technology to process orders, arrange service calls, communicate with customers, dispatch technicians and invoice customers. Service technicians work from service vehicles equipped with commonly used parts, supplies and tools to complete a variety of jobs. Commercial, industrial and institutional service agreements usually have terms of one to three years, with automatic annual renewals, and typically include thirty- to sixty-day cancellation notice periods. We also provide remote monitoring of temperature, pressure, humidity and air flow for HVAC systems. If the system is not operating within the specifications set forth by the customer and cannot be remotely adjusted, a service crew is dispatched to analyze and repair the system. 

Sources of Supply 

The raw materials and components we use include HVAC system components, ductwork, steel, sheet metal and copper tubing and piping. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic or foreign suppliers at competitive prices. Delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, may extend to one month or more. We estimate that direct purchase of commodities and finished products comprises between 10% and 15% of our average project cost. We have procedures to reduce commodity cost exposure; early buying of commodities for particular projects, or for general inventory, as well as including escalation and escape provisions in project bids and contracts wherever possible. 

Chillers for large units typically have the longest delivery time and generally have lead times of up to six months. The major components of commercial HVAC systems are compressors and chillers that are manufactured primarily by Carrier, Lennox, McQuay, Trane and York. The major suppliers of building automation control systems are Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Siemens, York, Automated Logic, Novar and Andover Control Corporation. We do not have any significant contracts guaranteeing us a supply of raw materials or components. 

Cyclicality and Seasonality 

Historically, the construction industry has been highly cyclical. As a result, our volume of business may generally be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the United States during periods of economic weakness. 

The HVAC industry is subject to seasonal variations. Specifically, the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months (the first quarter of the year) due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months. Demand for HVAC services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally will be lower in the first calendar quarter. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have a diverse customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than 3% of consolidated 2015 revenue. Management and a dedicated sales force are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key customers. Customers generally include building owners and developers and property managers, as well as general contractors, architects and consulting engineers. We intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long-term relationships 

with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service in a professional manner. We believe we can continue to leverage the diverse technical and marketing strengths at individual locations to expand the services offered in other local markets. With respect to multi-location service opportunities, we maintain a national sales force in our national accounts group. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 7,301 employees. We have collective bargaining agreements covering eleven employees. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are good. 

Recruiting, Training and Safety 

Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineers, service technicians, field supervisors and project managers. We believe our success in retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our recruiting, training, compensation, employee benefits programs and opportunities for advancement. We provide numerous training programs for management, sales and leadership, as well as on-the-job training, technical training, apprenticeship programs, attractive benefit packages and career advancement opportunities within our company. 

We have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all technicians comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal, state and local laws and regulations. Additionally, we have implemented a "best practices" safety program throughout our operations, which provides employees with incentives to improve safety performance and decrease workplace accidents. Safety leadership establishes safety programs and benchmarking to improve safety across the Company. Finally, our employment screening process seeks to determine that prospective employees have requisite skills, sufficient background references and acceptable driving records, if applicable. Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.99 during 2015. This level was 26% better than the most recently published OSHA rate for our industry. 

Insurance and Litigation 

The primary insured risks in our operations are bodily injury, property damage and workers' compensation injuries. We retain the risk for workers' compensation, employer's liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per incident or occurrence. Because we have very large deductibles, the vast majority of our claims are paid by us, so as a practical matter we self-insure the great majority of these risks. Losses up to such per-incident deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages using the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations. 

We are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims. We have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain litigation in our consolidated financial statements. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion and based on reports of counsel, any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition, after giving effect to provisions already recorded. 

We typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new HVAC systems and pass through to the customer manufacturers' warranties on equipment. We generally warrant labor for thirty days after servicing existing HVAC systems. We do not expect warranty claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Competition 

The HVAC industry is highly competitive and consists of thousands of local and regional companies. We believe that purchasing decisions in the commercial, industrial and institutional markets are based on (i) competitive price, (ii) long-term customer relationships, (iii) quality, timeliness and reliability of services provided, (iv) an organization's perceived stability based on years in business, financial strength and access to bonding, (v) range of services provided, and (vi) scale of operation. To improve our competitive position we focus on both the consultative "design and build" installation market and the maintenance, repair and replacement market to promote first the development and then the strengthening of long-term customer relationships. In addition, we believe our ability to provide multi-location coverage, access to project financing and specialized technical skills for facilities owners gives us a strategic advantage over smaller competitors who may be unable to provide these services to customers at a competitive price. 

We believe that we are larger than most of our competitors, which are generally small, owner-operated companies that typically operate in a limited geographic area. However, there are divisions of larger contracting companies, utilities and HVAC equipment manufacturers that provide HVAC services in some of the same service lines and geographic areas we serve. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do to finance development opportunities and support their operations. We believe our smaller competitors generally compete with us based on price and their long-term relationships with local customers. Our larger competitors compete with us on those factors but may also provide attractive financing and comprehensive service and product packages. 

Vehicles 

We operate a fleet of various owned or leased service trucks, vans and support vehicles. We believe these vehicles generally are well maintained and sufficient for our current operations. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: (i) licensing requirements applicable to engineering, construction and service technicians, (ii) building and HVAC codes and zoning ordinances, (iii) regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements, (iv) special bidding and procurement requirements on government projects, (v) wage and hour regulations, and (vi) regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws directed towards protection of employees. We believe we have all required licenses to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses. 

Many state and local regulations governing the HVAC services trades require individuals to hold permits and licenses. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all of our service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. We seek to ensure that, where possible, we have two employees who hold any such permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic region. 

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of ozone-depleting refrigerants generally classified as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Clean Air Act regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of equipment containing these 

refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants. These requirements have increased our training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment. The Clean Air Act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs and HCFCs in the United States and to require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement HVAC systems. Some replacement refrigerants, already in use, and classified as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are not ozone-depleting substances. HFCs are considered by USEPA to have high global warming potential. USEPA may at some point require the phase-out of HFCs and expand existing technician certification requirements to cover the handling of HFCs. We do not believe the existing regulations governing technician certification requirements for the handling of ozone-depleting substances or possible future regulations applicable to HFCs will materially affect our business on the whole because, although they require us to incur modest ongoing training costs, our competitors also incur such costs, and such regulations may encourage or require our customers to update their HVAC systems.
