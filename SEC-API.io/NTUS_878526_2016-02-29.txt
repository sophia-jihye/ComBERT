Neurology 

Our neurology business unit represents a comprehensive line of products that are used by healthcare practitioners in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system, including outpatient private practice facilities and inpatient hospital environments including diagnostic procedures and monitoring of patients during admissions, surgery, while under sedation, in post-operative care, and in intensive care units. Our neurology products and services include: 

&#8226; 

Electroencephalography (&#8220;EEG&#8221;) &#8212;Equipment and supplies used to monitor and visually display the electrical activity generated by the brain and other key physiological signals for both diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders in the hospital, research laboratory, clinician office and patient&#8217;s home. 

&#8226; 

Electromyography (&#8220;EMG&#8221;) &#8212;Equipment and supplies used to measure electrical activity in nerves, muscles, and critical pathways includes EMG, nerve conduction and evoked potential functionality. 

&#8226; 

Polysomnography (&#8220;PSG&#8221;) &#8212;Equipment and supplies used to measure a variety of respiratory and physiologic functions to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that causes a person to stop breathing intermittently during sleep. 

Diagnostic EEG and Long-term Monitoring 

We design, manufacture, and market a full line of instruments and supplies used to help diagnose the presence of seizure disorders and epilepsy, look for causes of confusion, evaluate head injuries, tumors, infections, degenerative diseases, and metabolic disturbances that affect the brain, and assist in surgical planning. This type of testing is also done to diagnose brain death in comatose patients. These systems and instruments work by detecting, amplifying, and recording the brain&#8217;s electrical impulses (EEGs) as well as other physiological signals needed to support clinical findings. Routine clinical EEG recording is done by placing electrodes on a patient&#8217;s scalp over various areas of the brain to record and detect patterns of activity and specific types of electrical 

events. EEG technologists perform the tests, and neurologists, neurophysiologists and epileptologists review and interpret the results. 

Routine outpatient clinical EEG testing is performed in hospital neurology laboratories, private physician offices, and in ambulatory settings such as the patient&#8217;s home, providing physicians with a clinical assessment of a patient&#8217;s condition. Long-term inpatient monitoring of EEG and behavior (LTM) is used to determine complex treatment plans, and for patients with seizures that do not respond to conventional therapeutic approaches, surgical solutions may be appropriate. Patients suffering from severe head trauma and other acute conditions that may affect the brain are monitored in intensive care units (&#8220;ICUs&#8221;). In addition, research facilities use EEG equipment to conduct research on humans and laboratory animals. 

Global Neuro-Diagnostic Services ("GND") which we acquired in early 2015, provides in-home ambulatory EEG monitoring. GND works with physicians and hospitals to provide superior care and testing services to its patients. Upon receiving a physician referral, GND provides program services in the patient's home, professional oversight throughout the study and preliminary report generation for physician review. GND has received accreditation by The Joint Commission as a home EEG testing services company and also has achieved the American Board of Registered Electroencephalographic and Evoked Potential Technologists (ABRET) Laboratory Accreditation in routine EEG services.

Our services are specifically designed to partner with hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency, results, and turn-around time, and to reduce costs. 

Electrodiagnostic Monitoring 

Our electrodiagnostic systems include EMG, nerve conduction (&#8220;NCS&#8221;), and often evoked potential functionality. EMG and NCS involve the measurement of electrical activity of muscles and nerves both at rest and during contraction. Measuring the electrical activity in muscles and nerves can help diagnose diseases of the peripheral, central nervous system or musculature system. An electromyogram is done to determine if there is any disease present that effects muscle tissue, nerves, or the junctions between nerve and muscle (neuromuscular junctions). An electromyogram can also be used to diagnose the cause of weakness, paralysis, and muscle twitching, and is also used as a primary diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the most frequently encountered 

peripheral compressive neuropathy. EMG is also used for clinical applications of botox to relieve muscle spasm and pain. We market both the clinical system and the needles used for these procedures. 

In addition to EMG and NCS functionality, many of our Electrodiagnostic systems also include Evoked Potential functionality (&#8220;EP&#8221;). Evoked potentials are elicited in response to a stimulus. These evoked potentials can come from the sensory pathways (such as hearing and visual) or from the motor pathways. An examination tests the integrity of these pathways including the associated area of the brain. Sophisticated amplifiers are required to recognize and average evoked potential EMG and NCS signals.

Diagnostic Polysomnography Monitoring 

Polysomnography (&#8220;PSG&#8221;), which involves the analysis of respiratory patterns, brain electrical activity and other physiological data, has proven critical for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-related diseases such as apnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy. A full polysomnographic sleep study entails a whole-night recording of brain electrical activity, muscle movement, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen levels, electrical activity of the heart, and other parameters. In some studies patients are fitted with treatment devices using Positive Airway Pressure technology (&#8220;PAP&#8221;) during the sleep study and the proper settings for the treatment devices are determined. In many cases, the sleep study is performed in the patient&#8217;s home.

Newborn Hearing Screening 

Hearing impairment is the most common treatable chronic disorder in newborns, affecting as many as five babies out of every 1,000 newborns. It is estimated that 20,000 hearing-impaired babies are born in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) every year, and as many as 60,000 more in the rest of the developed world. Until the introduction of universal newborn hearing screening programs, 

screening was generally performed only on those newborns that had identifiable risk factors for hearing impairment. However, screening only those newborns with risk factors for hearing impairment overlooks approximately half of newborns with some level of hearing impairment. 

Early identification of hearing impairment and early intervention has been shown to improve language development significantly. Undetected hearing impairment often results in the failure to learn, process spoken language, and speak. 

Newborn Hearing Screening Techniques 

The two traditional technologies used to screen newborns and infants for hearing impairment are auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions. 

Auditory brainstem response (&#8220;ABR&#8221;). ABR technology is the most accurate and comprehensive method for screening and diagnosing hearing impairment. ABR technology is based on detecting the brain&#8217;s electric impulses resulting from a specific auditory stimulus. 

Otoacoustic emission (&#8220;OAE&#8221;). OAEs are sounds created by the active biomechanical processes within the sensory cells of the cochlea. They occur both spontaneously and in response to acoustic stimuli. OAE screening uses a probe placed in the ear canal to deliver auditory stimuli and to measure the response of the sensory cells with a sensitive microphone. 

Newborn Hearing Screening Product Lines 

Our newborn hearing screening product lines consist of the ALGO, ABaer, AuDX, and Echo-Screen newborn hearing screeners. These hearing screening products utilize proprietary signal detection technologies to provide accurate and non-invasive hearing screening for newborns and are designed to detect hearing loss at 30 or 35 dB nHL or higher. Each of these devices is designed to generate a PASS or REFER result. 

&#8226; 

ALGO 5 and 3i Newborn Hearing Screeners. These AABR devices deliver thousands of soft audible clicks to the newborn&#8217;s ears through sound cables and disposable earphones connected to the instrument. Each click elicits an identifiable brain wave, which is detected by disposable electrodes placed on the head of the child and analyzed by the screening device. These devices use our proprietary AABR signal detection algorithm. 

&#8226; 

ABaer Newborn Hearing Screener. The ABaer, which is a PC-based newborn hearing screening device, offers a combination of AABR, OAE, and diagnostic ABR technologies in one system. 

&#8226; 

Echo-Screen. Our hand-held Echo-Screen products provide a choice or combination of proprietary ABR and OAE technologies that can also be used for children through adults. The new Echo-Screen III device is a compact, multi-modality handheld hearing screener that is tightly integrated with audible Lite Hearing Screening Data Management&#153;. 

&#8226; 

AuDX. Our AuDX product is a hand-held OAE screening device that can be used for newborn hearing screening, as well as patients of all ages, from children through adults. AuDX devices record and analyze OAEs generated by the cochlea through sound cables and disposable ear probes inserted into the patient&#8217;s ear canal. OAE technology is unable to detect hearing disorders affecting the neural pathways, such as auditory neuropathy . 

Hearing Screening Supply Products 

For infection control, accuracy, and ease of use, the supply products used with our newborn hearing screening devices are designed as single-use, disposable products. Each screening supply product is designed for a specific hearing screening technology. 

&#8226; 

ABR Screening Supply Kits. Each ABR screen is carried out with single-use earphones and electrodes, which are alcohol and latex-free. The adhesives used in these supply products are specially formulated for use on the sensitive skin of newborns. To meet the needs of our customers we offer a variety of packaging options.

Peloton provides all aspects of the program: equipment, supplies, professional oversight by nurses or audiologists, screening personnel, case management, quality review &#38; oversight, and state data management reporting. 

Newborn Brain Injury 

For many years, newborn infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (&#8220;NICU&#8221;) of a hospital have routinely been monitored for heart activity, temperature, respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Recently it has also been considered important to monitor brain activity. A cerebral function monitor, utilizing amplitude-integrated EEGs (&#8220;aEEGs&#8221;), is a device for monitoring background neurological activity. Our simplified aEEG devices introduced over ten years ago allow neonatologists and nurses to set-up and interpret basic neurological traces without neurology oversight. 

Newborn Brain Injury Products 

Our newborn brain injury products record and display parameters that the neonatologist uses to assess and monitor neurological status in the newborn. These devices continuously monitor and record brain activity, aiding in the detection and treatment of HIE and seizures. The devices also monitor the effects of drugs and other therapies on brain activity and improve the accuracy of newborn neurological assessments. They are used with electrodes attached to the head of the newborn to acquire an EEG signal that is then filtered, compressed, and displayed graphically on the device or as a hardcopy printout. The monitors have touch screens for easy navigation and onscreen keyboards for data entry at the bedside. 

&#8226; 

Olympic Brainz Monitor . The Olympic Brainz Monitor (&#8220;OBM&#8221;) is our latest generation Cerebral Function Monitor (&#8220;CFM&#8221;). The device can be used in single-channel, two-channel or three-channel modes to continuously monitor and record brain activity. 

Thermoregulation

Our NatalCare incubators, including those used for transporting infants, provide high thermal performance with a double wall design, easy to use control panels and features such as improved weighing functionality with automatic centering and an electronic tilting mechanism. The easy to clean, smooth design, and choice of options make these customizable incubators appropriate for different use environments. 

Jaundice Management 

The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that each year 60% of the approximately four million newborns in the U.S. become jaundiced. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, neonatal jaundice is the single largest cause for hospital readmission of newborns in the U.S., and accounts for 50% of readmissions. Because of the serious consequences of hyperbilirubinemia, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all newborns be closely monitored for jaundice and has called for the physician to determine the presence or absence of an abnormal rate of hemolysis to establish the appropriate treatment for the newborn. 

In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued new guidelines for the treatment of jaundice in newborns. The guidelines recommend phototherapy as the standard of care for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in infants born at 35 weeks or more of gestation. The guidelines further highlight the need for &#8220;intense&#8221; phototherapy, and specifically recommend the use of the &#8220;blue&#8221; light treatment incorporated into our neoBLUE products. 

Jaundice Management Products 

&#8226; 

neoBLUE Product Family. This product line consists of our neoBLUE, neoBLUE Mini, neoBLUE Cozy, and neoBLUE blanket devices, which utilize light emitting diodes (&#8220;LEDs&#8221;) to generate a high-intensity, narrow spectrum of blue light that is clinically proven to be most effective in the treatment of newborn jaundice. Our neoBLUE phototherapy devices emit significantly less ultraviolet light and heat than conventional phototherapy devices, reducing the risk of skin damage and dehydration for infants undergoing treatment. Because of the high intensity of these lights, the treatment time associated with phototherapy is reduced. 

&#8226; 

Medix MediLED Product Family. A full-size, free-standing LED phototherapy system and a MediLED mini light to be used on top of an incubator or attached to the Medix radiant warmer. The MediLED incorporates an array of blue and white LEDs, while the mini system utilizes blue &#8220;super LEDs&#8221; that provide high intensity phototherapy. 

Diagnostic Hearing Assessment 

We design and manufacture a variety of products used to screen for or diagnose hearing loss, or to identify abnormalities affecting the peripheral and central auditory nervous systems in patients of all ages. The technology used in most of these systems is either electrodiagnostic in nature or measures a response from the cochlea known as an OAE.

Diagnostic Hearing Supply Products 

For infection control, accuracy, and ease of use, most supply products used with our diagnostic hearing devices and systems are designed as single-use, disposable products. Each screening supply product is designed for a specific diagnostic hearing technology, and is similar in nature to our previously described OAE supply products for use in newborn hearing screening. 

Balance and Mobility 

Balance is an ability to maintain the line of gravity of the body within the base of support with minimal postural sway. Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the vestibular (i.e. inner ear), somatosensory (i.e. touch, temperature, body position), and visual systems. Balance disorders impact a large percentage of the population in all age ranges from children to adults. Common complaints include dizziness, vertigo, or an inability to walk or drive a vehicle, which can all lead to the curtailment of daily life activities. These symptoms are exacerbated in elderly patients and can result in falls, orthopedic injuries, and sometimes death. 

Balance and Mobility Products 

Our principal balance and mobility products are sold under the Neurocom brand: 

&#8226; 

EquiTest. Proprietary protocols in the EquiTest family of devices objectively quantify and differentiate among sensory, motor, and central adaptive impairments to balance control. This approach is commonly referred to as computerized dynamic posturography (&#8220;CDP&#8221;). CDP is complementary to clinical tests designed to localize and categorize pathological mechanisms of balance disorders in that it can identify and differentiate the functional impairments associated with the identified disorders. 

&#8226;

Marketing and Sales 

Marketing 

Our marketing strategy differentiates our products by their level of quality, performance, and customer benefit. We educate customers worldwide about our products through: 

&#8226; 

Trade conference exhibits; and 

&#8226; 

Direct presentations to healthcare professionals. 

Domestic Direct and Distributor Sales 

We sell our products in North America primarily through a direct sales organization. We believe this direct sales organization allows us to maintain a higher level of customer service and satisfaction than would otherwise be possible by other distribution methods. We also sell certain products under private label and distribution arrangements. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , domestic revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows: &#160;

International Direct and Distributor Sales 

We sell some of our products outside the U.S. through direct sales channels in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and parts of Latin America; we sell other products in those regions and into more than 100 other countries through a distributor sales channel. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , international revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows: &#160;

We sell products to our distributors under substantially the same terms as sales through our direct sales channels. Terms of sales to international distributors are generally EXW, reflecting that goods are shipped &#8220;ex works,&#8221; in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point. Distributors are generally given exclusive rights in their territories to purchase products from Natus and resell to end users or sub distributors. Our distributors typically perform marketing, sales, and technical support functions in their respective markets. Each distributor may sell Natus products to their customer directly, via other distributors or resellers, or both. We actively train our distributors in product marketing, selling, and technical service techniques. 

Seasonality in Revenue 

We experience seasonality in our revenue. Demand for our products is historically higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. Our seasonality results from the purchasing habits of our hospital-based customers, whose purchases are often governed by calendar year budgets. 

Group Purchasing Organizations 

More than 90% of the hospitals in the U.S. are members of group purchasing organizations ("GPO"s), which negotiate volume purchase agreements for member hospitals, group practices, and other clinics. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , direct purchases by GPO members as a percent of revenue were approximately as follows: &#160;

Third-Party Reimbursement 

In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, including private health insurance plans, federal Medicare, state Medicaid, and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform. Third-party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services utilizing our products. In addition, our Peloton hearing screening service and GND services are dependent on third-party payors to reimburse us for services provided. 

Customer Service and Support 

We generally provide a one-year warranty on our medical device products. We also sell extended service agreements on our medical device products. Service, repair, and calibration services for our domestic customers are provided by Company-owned service centers and our field service specialists. Service for international customers is provided by a combination of Company-owned facilities and vendors on a contract basis. 

Manufacturing 

Other companies manufacture a significant portion of the components used in our products; however, we perform final assembly, testing, and packaging of most of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency. We also use contract vendors to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products. We perform regular quality audits of these vendors. 

We purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our quality specifications and inspections. We conduct quality audits of our key suppliers, several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices, or supplies for use with medical devices. Most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier. 

Our manufacturing, service, and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by local and foreign regulatory authorities. Our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and other government agencies. We are required to conduct our product design, testing, manufacturing, and control activities in conformance with the FDA&#8217;s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner. In addition, our production facilities have received International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 13485 certification. ISO 13485 certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical device companies meet the standards of quality on a worldwide basis. We have also received the EC Certificate pursuant to the European Union Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which allows us to place a CE mark on our products. 

Research and Development 

We are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy. 

Internal product development capabilities. We believe that product development capabilities are essential to provide our customers with new product offerings. We plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings. 

Partnerships that complement our expertise. We continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us. By taking advantage of our core competencies, we believe that we can bring products to market in an efficient manner and leverage our distribution channels. 

New opportunities through technology acquisition. We continue to evaluate new, emerging, and complementary technologies in order to identify new product opportunities. With our knowledge of our current markets we believe that we can effectively develop technologies into successful new products. 

Our research and development expenses were $30.4 million or 8.1% of total revenue in 2015 , $30.1 million or 8.5% of total revenue in 2014 , and $30.8 million or 8.9% of total revenue in 2013 . 

Proprietary Rights 

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and seek to control access to our intellectual property, distribution channels, documentation, and other proprietary information. However, we believe that these measures afford only limited protection. 

The intellectual rights to some of the original patents for technology incorporated into our products are now in the public domain. However, we do not consider these patents, or any currently viable patent or related group of patents, to be of such importance that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business. 

We capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property, as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights, and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets. 

We have several registered trademarks and service marks. Our marks are pending or registered trademarks in the United States and several foreign countries. We intend to file for additional trademarks to strengthen our trademark rights, but we cannot be certain that our trademark applications will result in registration or that our trademarks will be enforceable. 

Competition 

We sell our products in competitive and rapidly evolving markets. We face competition from other companies in all of our product lines. Our competitors range from small privately-held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth. We do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines. 

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our medical devices. In the U.S., we sell our supply products in a mature market and we expect that our products could face increasing competition, including competitors offering lower prices, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins. 

We believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our products, include: 

&#8226; 

Level of specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of the product; 

&#8226; 

Time required to obtain results with the product, such as to test for or treat a clinical condition; 

&#8226; 

Relative ease of use of the product; 

&#8226; 

Depth and breadth of the products features; 

&#8226; 

Quality of customer support for the product; 

&#8226; 

Frequency of product updates; 

&#8226; 

Extent of third-party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure; 

&#8226; 

Extent to which the products conform to standard of care guidelines; and 

&#8226; 

Price of the product. 

We believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products. Different competitors may have competitive advantages in one or more of the categories listed above and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. 

Government Regulation 

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 

Unless an exemption applies, the medical devices we sell in the United States, with the exception of some disposable products, must first receive one of the following types of FDA premarket review authorizations under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, as amended: 

&#8226; 

Clearance via Section 510(k); or 

&#8226; 

Premarket approval via Section 515 if the FDA has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury. 

The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can take longer. The process of obtaining premarket approval via Section 515 is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. Premarket approval generally takes from one to three years, but can take longer. We cannot be sure that the FDA will ever grant either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market in the United States. 

The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the FDA perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed. The FDA places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either Class I or Class II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The premarket notification under Section 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. 

The FDA places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, in its Class III classification. The FDA requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process via Section 515 in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device. A premarket approval application must provide extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. 

The FDA may require results of clinical trials in support of a 510(k) submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application. In order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant-risk device, the FDA requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain, in advance, an investigational-device exemption. The investigational-device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. If the FDA and the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational-device exemption application for a significant-risk device, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial. An investigational-device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol, including the number of patients and study sites. If the manufacturer deems the product a non-significant risk device, the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational-device exemption requirements. If the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non-significant risk determination, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial. 

Most of our products have been cleared by the FDA as Class II devices. Some of our disposable products and newborn care products, such as our neonatal headshields and oxygen delivery systems, have received FDA clearance as Class I devices. 

FDA Regulation 

Numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply to our products. These requirements include: 

&#8226; 

FDA quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create, implement, and follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures; 

&#8226; 

Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA certain types of adverse and other events involving their products; and 

&#8226; 

FDA general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses. 

Class II and III devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines that may not apply to Class I devices. We believe we are in compliance with applicable FDA guidelines, but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the FDA changes existing regulations or adopts new requirements. 

We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to adequately comply, the FDA can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, including: 

&#8226; 

Issuance of a Form 483 citation; 

&#8226; 

Fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; 

&#8226; 

Recall or seizure of our products; 

&#8226; 

Issuance of public notices or warnings; 

&#8226; 

Imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production; 

&#8226; 

Refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products; 

&#8226; 

Withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval already granted; or 

&#8226; 

Criminal prosecution. 

The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair, replace, or refund the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. 

Other Regulations 

We also must comply with numerous additional federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, biohazards, fire hazard control, and hazardous substance disposal. We believe we are currently in compliance with such regulations. 

Countries outside of the U.S. regulate medical devices in a manner similar to that of the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to audit and have been certified to be ISO 13485:2003, Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, and CMDCAS compliant, which allows us to sell our products in Canada, Europe, and other territories around the world. Our manufacturing facilities in North America are subject to ISO 13485 inspections by our notified body, British Standards Institution Management Systems, and by other notified bodies outside of North America. We plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries, while maintaining our current approvals. The time and cost of obtaining new, and maintaining existing, market authorizations from countries outside of North America, and the requirements for licensing products in these countries may differ significantly from FDA requirements. 

Employees 

On December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1,067 full time employees worldwide. In Argentina, some of our production employees are represented by labor unions and our employees in Germany have established a works council. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
