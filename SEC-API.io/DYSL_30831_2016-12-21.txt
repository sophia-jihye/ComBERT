 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Dynasil Corporation of America was founded as a New Jersey corporation in 1960 and incorporated in the state of Delaware through a migratory merger in March 2008. Our corporate headquarters are located at 313 Washington Street, Suite 403, Newton, MA 02458, and our corporate website is www.dynasil.com . You can access, free of charge, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any other amendments to those reports, through a link at our website, or at the Commission&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov .

&#160;

We have the following three reporting segments based on our main operating activities:

&#160;

&#183; Contract Research: The Contract Research segment consists of the Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (&#8220;RMD&#8221;) business unit, which is among the largest small business participants in U.S. government-funded research. &#160; 

&#183; Optics : The Optics segment encompasses four business units &#8211; Dynasil Fused Silica, Optometrics, Hilger Crystals, and Evaporated Metal Films &#8211; that manufacture commercial products, including optical crystals for sensing in the security and medical imaging markets, as well as optical components, optical coatings and optical materials for scientific instrumentation and other applications. &#160; 

&#183; Biomedical: The Biomedical segment consists of a single business unit, Dynasil Biomedical Corporation (&#8220;Dynasil Biomedical&#8221;), a medical technology incubator which owns rights to certain early stage medical technologies. In October 2013, Dynasil Biomedical formed Xcede Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Xcede&#8221;), a joint venture with Mayo Clinic to spin out and separately fund the development of a tissue sealant technology. At September 30, 2016, Dynasil Biomedical owned 83% of the common stock of Xcede, thus Xcede is included in our consolidated financial statements. Dynasil Biomedical currently has no operations other than relating to its equity ownership in Xcede. &#160; 

The segment amounts included in MD&#38;A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Segment information appearing in Note 16 &#8211; Segment, Customer and Geographical Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements is also presented on this basis.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our business strategy is based on continued development and expansion of our funded research portfolio, investment in the commercialization of the technologies originating from our Contract Research segment, organic growth of existing Optics segment products, continuing development of the Xcede medical technologies using outside funding and acquisitions that align with our core competencies.

&#160; 

Historical Growth by Acquisition 

&#160;

Through a series of acquisitions beginning in March 2005, Dynasil has evolved from a single product line optics company to one focused on multiple optical product lines and a significant contract research business focused on advanced materials used in radiation detection and other advanced instrumentation. Our revenue has increased from $2 million in FY 2004 to $43 million in FY 2016.

&#160;

The acquisitions we completed during this period included:

&#160;

&#183; Optometrics: In March 2005, we acquired Optometrics LLC (&#8220;Optometrics&#8221;), a worldwide supplier of optical components and instruments, including diffraction gratings, interference filters, monochromators, laser optics and specialized optical systems. &#160;

&#183; Evaporated Metal Films: In October 2006, we acquired Evaporated Metal Films Corporation (&#8220;EMF&#8221;), an optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of application markets, including solar energy, display systems, dental photography, optical instruments, satellite communications and lighting. &#160;

&#183; RMD: In July 2008, we acquired Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc. (&#8220;RMD&#8221;), a contract research company, and RMD Instruments, LLC (&#8220;Dynasil Products&#8221;), a precision instruments company that manufactured and sold instruments in the medical imaging and industrial markets, including hand-held analyzers for lead paint and gamma medical probes for cancer surgery. The lead paint detector and gamma medical probe businesses were sold in fiscal 2014. &#160;

&#183; Hilger Crystals: In July 2010, we acquired Hilger Crystals, Ltd., (&#8220;Hilger&#8221;) a manufacturer of synthetic crystals applicable to a wide range of industrial, medical, and homeland security applications with a long history of supplying high-quality synthetic crystals for infrared spectroscopy, X-ray and gamma ray detection. &#160;

&#183; Biomedical technologies: In April 2011, we acquired the rights to six early stage biomedical technologies from Dr. Daniel Ericson, a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic, which jointly owns rights to certain of the technologies acquired. The activity of our Biomedical segment is currently focused on the development of the tissue sealant technology that was part of this transaction in its Xcede subsidiary. &#160;

&#183; DichroTec Thin Films : In June 2014, our EMF subsidiary acquired the assets of DichroTec Thin Films LLC, another optical thin-film coatings company with a broad range of applications, many of which are similar to EMF&#8217;s applications. &#160; 

Contract Research &#8211; the Science Behind our Technology 

&#160;

Our Contract Research segment&#8217;s business unit, RMD, is among the largest small business participants in U.S. government-funded research, performing research and development activities for government agencies including Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, National Institutes of Health and NASA.

&#160;

RMD develops advanced technology in materials, sensors and prototype instruments that detect or measure radiation, light, magnetism or sound for use in security, medical and industrial applications. RMD has research expertise in material science, radiation detection, digital imaging technology, magnetic imaging, laser optics and photonics. As of September 30, 2016, our Contract Research segment had a total of 79 employees, including 27 Ph.D. level scientists. RMD serves as an incubator to expand our patent portfolio enabling the opportunity to advance our technology from development to commercialization using government-funded research. As of September 30, 2016, RMD had a portfolio of 68 issued U.S. patents and 42 pending patent applications, compared with 61 issued patents and 53 pending patent applications at the same point in 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

For nearly thirty years, RMD has successfully conducted government research under the auspices of the Small Business Innovation Research (&#8220;SBIR&#8221;) program. In recent years, RMD has augmented its SBIR research with larger, competitively bid government research and development contracts. To grow our research portfolio within the federal government, we are broadening our relationships within key federal funding agencies and the U.S. military. RMD also provides research for non-governmental entities in areas where it has the appropriate expertise. Such research is currently not a significant portion of RMD&#8217;s revenue. Our research initiatives are aligned with our focus on the homeland security, medical and industrial markets. As of September 30, 2016, RMD had a contract backlog of approximately $30 million, of which approximately 48% is SBIR contracts. 

&#160;

RMD competes for contract research work against a variety of small and large entities, including universities that submit research proposals based on specific government solicitations. We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include Cost Reimbursement, Time &#38; Materials (T&#38;M), Fixed Price-Level of Effort and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts. We believe that RMD&#8217;s reputation for conducting state-of-the art research and development, as well as the quality of its proposals, are significant competitive advantages. In addition, RMD maintains strong working relationships with universities, government agencies, national laboratories, research hospitals and corporations. However, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and may be better able to operate large, well-funded research and development programs. 

&#160;

We believe that research projects can provide an important source for new commercial products in areas such as medical imaging, industrial sensors, critical care and point of care diagnostics and homeland security. For example, Dynasil Products&#8217; lead paint analyzer and gamma medical probes businesses, which were sold in fiscal year 2014, emanated from the RMD portfolio. Most recently, our government-funded research work supported the development of our CLYC dual-mode radiation detection technology which we are currently selling commercially. 

&#160;

Our Optical Technology 

&#160; 

We specialize in the production of optical materials, components and coatings for various applications in the medical, industrial, and homeland security/defense sectors.

&#160;

Our Optics segment supplies synthetic crystals, optical materials, components, and coatings that are used in devices such as baggage scanners, medical imaging systems, optical instruments, lasers, analytical instruments, automotive components, semiconductor/electronic devices, spacecraft/aircraft components and advertising displays. These products are offered through four business units (Dynasil Fused Silica, Optometrics, Hilger and EMF).

&#160;

We compete for business with fabricators of industrial optical materials, other optical components manufacturers, other optical crystal manufacturers and other optical coaters as well as other analytical instruments manufacturers and synthetic crystal manufacturers. We believe our proprietary processes, reputation, specialty product offering, products in development and the price at which we offer our products enable us to successfully compete in these markets. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do, which may enable them to develop and market products that would compete against those developed by us.

&#160;

Our products are distributed through a direct sales and marketing staff of ten people and through other channels, including manufacturer&#8217;s representatives and distributors in various foreign countries for international sales and U.S. manufacturers&#8217; representatives for certain product lines. Marketing efforts include direct customer contact through sales visits, advertising in trade publications and attendance at trade shows.

&#160; 

Biomedical: Xcede and Our Development of a Tissue Sealant Technology 

&#160; 

Xcede's first product currently under development is a resorbable hemostatic patch to be used when conventional techniques are inadequate or impractical during general surgery for the kidneys, liver and spleen. The Xcede Patch is intended to be used during surgical procedures to stop bleeding (Hemostasis). Preclinical testing to date indicates this product promotes hemostasis within 60 seconds, a time that is faster than currently approved hemostatic patches. As described above, in 2011, Dynasil Biomedical acquired rights to the underlying tissue sealant technology as part of a transaction with a former hematologist at the Mayo Clinic. Since that time, Dynasil Biomedical has invested significant capital developing this tissue sealant technology, including costs to further the related intellectual property rights and to conduct animal studies.

&#160;

In October 2013, Dynasil Biomedical formed a new subsidiary, Xcede, and transferred its rights in the tissue sealant technology to it. Xcede was formed as a means of focusing our development efforts on this tissue sealant technology and facilitating the third-party funding of the development costs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Xcede received $2.9 million in cash since inception from external investors and certain directors and officers of the Company in exchange for 5% convertible notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated October 2013 and amended July 2016 that provided for the issuance of up to $5.2 million in aggregate principal amount of such notes. The notes were convertible into equity of Xcede at a 20% discount to the first equity financing of Xcede of at least $3.0 million, inclusive of the notes and interest. At September 30, 2016, the total outstanding principal of these convertible notes was $5.1 million, including $2.2 million of notes to Dynasil Biomedical which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

The note purchase agreement was amended in April 2014, May 2015 and July 2016 to allow for the issuance of an additional $3.2 million in aggregate principal amount of such notes (of which $0.8 million was issued in fiscal year 2016) and extend the notes&#8217; maturity date. As amended, the notes were payable after June 30, 2017 upon the demand of the holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding amount of the notes. Xcede used the net proceeds from the issuances of the notes to finance its pre-clinical research activities.

&#160;

In January 2016, Xcede announced that it had signed three agreements with Cook Biotech Inc. of West Lafayette, Indiana, including a Development Agreement, a License Agreement and a Supply Agreement, in connection with the development, regulatory approval and production of Xcede&#8217;s resorbable hemostatic patch. In November 2016, Xcede announced Cook Biotech Inc. had agreed to fund the pre-clinical testing of, and subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals initiate clinical trials for, its first tissue sealant product. In addition, in November 2016, the Company committed to invest $1.2 million of cash into Xcede over the following 18 months, and all $5.1 million of existing notes and accrued interest were converted into preferred stock of Xcede.

&#160;

Through Dynasil Biomedical, as of September 30, 2016, Dynasil owned approximately 83% of the outstanding equity in Xcede, but with the conversion of the outstanding notes described above, the Company owned approximately 59%, as of December 1, 2016. Xcede&#8217;s investors consist of Mayo Clinic Ventures, Southern Initiative Minnesota Foundation, Rochester Area Economic Development Inc., angel investors and certain members of Dynasil&#8217;s executive management team and board of directors.

&#160; 

Strategy to Commercialize our Technologies 

&#160; 

Our business strategy focuses on combining our expertise in funded research, product development and technology innovation to commercialize detection and analysis equipment for the homeland security, industrial and medical markets. We are executing on this strategy by:

&#160;

&#183; developing and expanding our research portfolio; &#183; seeking to commercialize the technologies coming from our Contract Research segment; &#183; growing organically through investment in existing businesses; and &#183; identifying and investing in those technologies with the greatest revenue and growth potential in the market. &#160;

For example, our CLYC dual mode nuclear detection crystal technology was developed by RMD under a program for the Department of Homeland Security for use in locating nuclear bombs or nuclear materials at our nation&#8217;s major cities, ports and borders. This technology has the potential to be very important to our national security, as well as other radiation detection applications, such as nuclear power plant safety. Our dual mode detection crystals are being commercialized while RMD continues to further enhance this technology.

&#160;

Our CLYC dual mode detection crystals technology is designed to be a single detector that replaces two detector subsystems &#8211; the gamma radiation detector and also the helium-3 detectors for neutrons. Increasing our value proposition is the fact that the stockpile of the chemical element helium-3, a byproduct of nuclear weapons production, is in short supply. The stockpile of helium-3 has been drawn down during the past 10 years, as the federal government has increased its use in neutron detectors to help prevent nuclear and radiological material from being smuggled into the U.S.

&#160;

Intellectual Property (IP) 

&#160;

From October 2015 through September 2016, we have been granted eight new U.S. patents and have filed 13 new patent applications. Our current portfolio, company-wide, is 71 issued and 59 pending applications, the largest percentage of which are issued to RMD. We believe that intellectual property represents an important strategic advantage for us.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We have more than 600 customers, with approximately 58% of our business concentrated in our top 10 customers. Our largest customer is a customer of our Optics segment and accounted for 12% of our overall revenue during fiscal year 2016. Our next four largest customers are agencies and agents of the Federal government and accounted for approximately 11%, 10%, 5% and 5%, respectively, of our revenue during fiscal year 2016. The loss of any of these top five customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Generally, our customers provide purchase orders for a specific part and quantity or they provide a contract for research projects. Product orders are normally filled over a period ranging from one to six weeks. We also have blanket orders that call for monthly deliveries of predetermined amounts. Contract research projects generally run for a one to two year period.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of 226 employees, 213 of which are full-time. Of the total, 41 of our employees are engaged in administration, 10 are engaged in sales, 84 are engaged in research and/or engineering and 91 are engaged in manufacturing. The Company has a total of 32 Ph.D. level employees. Our operations are non-union except for a two-person union in one location.

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160;

Our largest supplier for materials and components is a supplier of scintillator crystal material fabricated and sold by our U.K. facility. We believe that we have excellent relationships with our suppliers. If any of our suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in identifying such replacements.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our RMD business unit primarily provides research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) activities under government funded research contracts. The RMD business unit recognized revenue of $19.8 million and $18.8 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The direct costs associated with this revenue were $12.2 million and $10.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Substantially all the Contract Research segment&#8217;s cost of revenue relates to research performed by RMD which are in turn billed to the contracting party.

&#160;

R&#38;D for our other businesses, which totaled $1.0 million in fiscal year 2016 and $1.2 million in fiscal year 2015, was primarily new product development, changes to our manufacturing processes and the introduction of improved methods and equipment,

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The businesses that we operate are subject to various federal and states regulations.

&#160;

Our Contract Research segment is subject to the rules and regulations applicable to government contracting, including: the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts; the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bids and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials; the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. Government for payment or approval; and the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts.

&#160;

The tissue sealant being developed by Xcede, our joint venture with Mayo Clinic, is subject to FDA regulations and approval in the United States and requires CE marking and other regulatory agency approval in other countries around the world.

&#160;

Our use of radioactive materials in research and certain of our products (our dual-mode detector) subject us to laws regulating hazardous wastes under United States federal and certain state, environmental and atomic energy regulatory laws and similar laws in each jurisdiction in which our research and manufacturing facilities are located. Environmental compliance costs, which totaled $34,000 for fiscal year 2016, have not historically had a material effect on our operating results.

&#160;

With respect to our intellectual property rights, we rely on, and are subject to, the laws in the U.S. and abroad governing intellectual property protection.

&#160;
