 ITEM 1. BUSINES S. 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system, or CNS, disorders including pain. By focusing on this therapeutic area, we are addressing significant and growing markets where current treatment options are limited or inadequate. Our product candidate portfolio includes two late &#8209;stage candidates, AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05, which we are developing for multiple indications. We have initiated a Phase 3 trial with AXS &#8209;02 in complex regional pain syndrome and plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in knee osteoarthritis associated with bone marrow lesions in the first quarter of 2016 pursuant to a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. We have also initiated a Phase 3 trial with AXS &#8209;05 in treatment resistant depression. We aim to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes differentiated therapies that expand the treatment options available to caregivers and improve the lives of patients living with CNS disorders. 

Our first product candidate, AXS &#8209;02 (disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate), is a potentially first &#8209;in &#8209;class, oral, targeted, non &#8209;opioid therapeutic for chronic pain. AXS &#8209;02 is a potent inhibitor of osteoclasts, which are bone remodeling cells that break down bone tissue. We are initially developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain in the following three conditions: complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS; knee osteoarthritis, or OA, associated with bone marrow lesions, or BMLs; and chronic low back pain, or CLBP, associated with type 1 or mixed type 1 and type 2 Modic changes, or MCs. These conditions exhibit target lesions or specific pathology that we believe may be addressed by the mechanisms of action of AXS &#8209;02, such as inhibition of osteoclast activity. These mechanisms may result in a reduction of pain in these conditions. We have successfully completed a Phase 1 trial of AXS &#8209;02 to characterize the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid and its effects on markers of bone resorption after oral administration of AXS &#8209;02. The results of our Phase 1 trial demonstrated that oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 tablets resulted in rapid absorption of zoledronic acid, which is the active molecule in AXS &#8209;02 and the free acid form of disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate, and substantial suppression of bone resorption markers, which are proteins indicative of bone tissue breakdown. We selected the dose for our ongoing and planned Phase 3 trials based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results of our Phase 1 trial. We intend to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval for AXS &#8209;02 utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory development pathway. 

We initiated a Phase 3 trial with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain in patients with CRPS, which we refer to as the CREATE &#8209;1 study, in July 2015. There is currently no drug approved by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to treat CRPS. CRPS is a debilitating condition characterized by severe pain in a limb, accompanied by autonomic, sensory, motor, and trophic changes. For many patients, the pain and associated loss of function result in significant and sometimes permanent disability. AXS &#8209;02 has been granted FDA Fast Track designation for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. AXS &#8209;02 has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the EMA for the treatment of CRPS. It has been estimated that approximately 80,000 individuals in the United States are diagnosed with CRPS annually. 

We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain in patients with knee OA associated with BMLs in the first quarter of 2016, which we refer to as the COAST &#8209;1 study. We have reached agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA for the COAST &#8209;1 study. There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat this subset of knee OA. Results from cross &#8209;sectional and longitudinal studies have shown an association between the presence of BMLs and knee pain in patients with knee OA. These studies suggest that BMLs are a source of knee pain and a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention. We believe the mechanisms of action of AXS &#8209;02 may preferentially target BMLs. We estimate that as many as 7 million individuals in the United States suffer from symptomatic knee OA and BMLs. 

&#160;

We plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat this subset of CLBP. Results of numerous studies suggest that MCs, especially type 1 MCs, are correlated with low back pain, and that changes in the extent of type 1 MCs are positively associated with changes in low back symptoms. These studies suggest that MCs are a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention. We believe the mechanisms of action of AXS &#8209;02 may preferentially target MCs. We estimate that as many as 1.6 million individuals in the United States suffer from CLBP associated with type 1 MCs. 

Our second product candidate, AXS &#8209;05, is an innovative fixed &#8209;dose combination of dextromethorphan, or DM, and bupropion. We are developing AXS &#8209;05 initially for the treatment of the following two conditions: treatment resistant depression, or TRD; and agitation in patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, or AD. DM is active at multiple CNS receptors but is rapidly and extensively metabolized in humans. As a result, it is difficult to attain potential therapeutic plasma levels of DM when it is dosed as a single agent. AXS &#8209;05 uses bupropion as a novel drug delivery method to inhibit DM metabolism and increase its bioavailability. We have demonstrated in two Phase 1 trials that DM plasma levels are substantially increased into a potentially therapeutic range with the co &#8209;administration of bupropion. Bupropion is itself active at distinct CNS receptors providing the potential for an additive or synergistic effect. We intend to seek FDA approval for AXS &#8209;05 utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory development pathway. 

We initiated a Phase 3 trial with AXS &#8209;05 in TRD, which we refer to as the STRIDE-1 study, in March 2016. Currently only one product, Symbyax, a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, is approved in the United States for the treatment of TRD. DM&#8217;s mechanisms of action encompass those of several antidepressant drug classes, and bupropion is a well &#8209;established antidepressant. DM administration has resulted in dose &#8209;dependent antidepressant &#8209;like effects in two widely used preclinical models of antidepressant effect. Furthermore, administration of DM with quinidine, which serves as an inhibitor of metabolism of DM, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with pseudobulbar affect, which is a disorder characterized by involuntary, sudden, and frequent episodes of laughing or crying, as shown in a third &#8209;party study. The term statistically significant denotes an experimental result, such as one derived from a clinical or non &#8209;clinical trial, that is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The plasma concentrations of DM achieved with AXS &#8209;05 in our Phase 1 trials are in the range of those associated with the DM and quinidine dose that resulted in a reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with pseudobulbar affect, based on data published by the FDA. We estimate that as many as 3 million individuals in the United States suffer from TRD. 

We intend to develop AXS &#8209;05 for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD, and plan to meet with the FDA this year to discuss our development plans. There is currently no FDA &#8209;approved pharmacological treatment for the indication of agitation in patients with AD. Agitation in patients with AD has been associated with increased caregiver burden, decreased functioning, earlier nursing home placement, and death. Administration of DM with quinidine has been shown to result in a statistically significant reduction in agitation in patients with probable AD, as shown in a randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled, third &#8209;party clinical trial. The plasma concentrations of DM achieved with AXS &#8209;05 in our Phase 1 trials are in the range of those associated with the DM and quinidine doses that resulted in a reduction in agitation in patients with probable AD, based on data published by the FDA. It has been estimated that AD afflicts 5 million individuals in the United States, with agitation being reported in as many as 40% of those afflicted. 

We have one active program, AXS &#8209;06, in preclinical development. We are developing AXS &#8209;06 for the treatment of chronic pain disorders. 

Our product candidates are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets, and proprietary know &#8209;how. If approved, they may also be eligible for periods of regulatory exclusivity. Our intellectual property portfolio includes U.S. patents with claims extending to 2034 for AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05, as well as corresponding foreign patent applications. Our U.S. and E.U. orphan designations for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CRPS potentially provide 7 and up to 12 years of marketing exclusivity in the respective geographies for the orphan indication. 

On November 19, 2015, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-207393) was declared effective for our initial public offering, pursuant to which we sold 5,666,667 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 

&#160;

$9.00 per share. From this offering we received gross proceeds of approximately $51.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $45.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to cost &#8209;effectively and efficiently develop and commercialize novel, differentiated therapies for the management of CNS disorders. The primary elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are the following: 

&#183; 

Pursue novel CNS indications with high unmet medical need. We believe that CNS disorders, including pain, are significantly underserved therapeutic segments with currently limited treatment options. We are initially developing our product candidates for indications that have no or few FDA &#8209;approved pharmacological treatments. For example, there currently is no drug approved by the FDA or the EMA for CRPS, the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs, CLBP associated with MCs, or agitation in patients with AD. There is currently only one FDA &#8209;approved drug for TRD. These conditions are often disabling, difficult to treat, and associated with significant comorbidities. By focusing on novel indications, we aim to develop products that have the potential to change current medical practice, and that are highly relevant to patients, physicians, and regulatory bodies because they address unmet medical needs. Many of these indications have significant patient populations which, when combined with the lack of approved treatments, should provide us with attractive commercial opportunities. 

&#183; 

Use biomarkers to define specific patient subsets for our pain indications. We are using biomarkers, such as BMLs and MCs, which are visible on magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to define specific subsets of patients who we believe are more likely to respond to the mechanisms of action of AXS &#8209;02. Biomarkers have been used successfully in connection with oncology treatments, but are not commonly used with pain therapeutics. While patients with common pain conditions, such as knee OA and CLBP, experience similar symptoms, these symptoms may be due to different underlying conditions. We believe that the variability in underlying conditions contributes to heterogeneity in these populations and may account for observed differences in treatment response. We believe that our targeted biomarker approach may result in a less heterogeneous patient population in our clinical trials, which may improve our ability to demonstrate a treatment effect and, if approved, enable treatment of more appropriate patient populations with our product candidates. 

&#183; 

Develop products with differentiated profiles. We aim to develop products with novel mechanisms of action for the intended indications that may yield differentiated product profiles. For example, AXS &#8209;02 utilizes a potentially first &#8209;in &#8209;class mechanism of action for the treatment of pain that may result in analgesia that lasts for one or more months after treatment. AXS &#8209;05 combines several mechanisms of action resulting in a unique pharmacological profile that may be relevant to the treatment of numerous CNS disorders. We believe that products with clearly differentiated features will be attractive to patients and their physicians, and will provide us with a competitive commercial advantage. 

&#183; 

Reduce clinical and regulatory risk, limit development costs, and accelerate time to market. Our product candidates incorporate chemical entities with long histories of clinical use and well &#8209;characterized safety profiles. Use of well &#8209;characterized molecules has allowed us to rapidly complete early clinical development of our product candidates, and may reduce the risk of late &#8209;stage clinical failures due to unexpected toxicities. This strategy also allows us to seek FDA approval for our product candidates using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, permits an applicant to file a new drug application, or NDA, that relies, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar drug, or on published literature. It therefore allows us to leverage previous preclinical and clinical experience with the active molecules in our product candidates and potentially forego conducting certain lengthy and costly preclinical studies, reduce clinical and regulatory risk, limit development costs, and accelerate our time to commercialization. 

&#183; 

Retain commercial rights in the United States, where appropriate, and selectively partner outside of the United States to maximize the value of our product candidates. We intend to commercialize AXS &#8209;02, if 

&#160;

approved, in the United States through the establishment of our own focused, cost &#8209;effective sales and marketing organization targeting high &#8209;prescribing specialists. We intend to selectively partner commercial rights outside of the United States with third parties to maximize the value of AXS &#8209;02 without the substantial investment required to develop independent sales forces in those geographies. We continue to evaluate strategic options for the commercialization of our other product candidates. 

Our Pipeline 

Our current product candidate pipeline is summarized in the table below: 

AXS &#8209;02 

Overview 

AXS &#8209;02 is a novel, targeted investigational pain therapeutic. It is an orally administered, non &#8209;opioid agent with a new mechanism of action for the treatment of pain. We are developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS, a severe and debilitating orphan condition. No drug is currently approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat CRPS. We are also developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs, and for the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs. No drug is currently approved by the FDA or the EMA specifically for these targeted subsets of knee OA and CLBP. 

We believe that, if successfully developed, AXS &#8209;02 may overcome many of the limitations of current treatments for pain, and may be attractive to patients and their physicians, based on the following differentiating features: 

&#183; 

Novel osteoclast &#8209;inhibiting mechanism of action for the treatment of pain 

&#183; 

Targeted therapy approach that utilizes radiographic biomarkers to identify appropriate patients 

&#183; 

Oral administration 

&#183; 

Convenient weekly dosing and short course of treatment 

&#183; 

Potential for extended duration of pain relief 

&#183; 

Lack of opioid &#8209;related side effects and abuse and addiction potential 

&#160;

We initiated a Phase 3 trial with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS in July 2015. We plan to initiate Phase 3 trials with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs in the first quarter of 2016, and for the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. 

Novel Mechanisms of Action for Pain 

Zoledronic acid, the active molecule in AXS &#8209;02, is a potent nitrogen &#8209;containing bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates are compounds that bind with high affinity to bone mineral and inhibit the bone &#8209;resorbing cells called osteoclasts. Zoledronic acid reduces osteoclast activity by inhibiting a critical enzyme called farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, or FPPS. Zoledronic acid is the bisphosphonate with the strongest affinity for bone and the highest inhibitory activity of FPPS. Osteoclasts resorb bone by secreting protons and generating an acidic extracellular microenvironment. The secreted protons may directly excite pain receptors, which are found in mineralized bone. We believe that zoledronic acid may therefore reduce pain by inhibiting osteoclast hyperactivity and suppressing the up &#8209;regulation of acid &#8209;sensing ion channels on sensory neurons. Zoledronic acid has also been shown to inhibit the production of pro &#8209;inflammatory cytokines and to have anti &#8209;angiogenic properties. 

Targeted Therapy for Pain 

We are developing AXS &#8209;02 for specific subsets of patients who display certain target lesions or specific pathology that we believe may be addressed by the mechanisms of action of our product candidate. The target lesions include regional osteoporosis, BMLs, and MCs. In order to select for CRPS patients with target lesions, such as regional osteoporosis, we plan to include only patients whose condition was precipitated by traumatic injury in our registration trials for CRPS. We plan to include only patients with BMLs in our registration trials of AXS &#8209;02 for the pain of knee OA, and only patients with MCs in our registration trials of AXS &#8209;02 for CLBP. These target lesions exhibit increased bone turnover, which is potentially inhibited by zoledronic acid. Furthermore, because zoledronic acid localizes preferentially to sites of high bone turnover, we believe it may specifically target these sites of disease activity in CRPS, knee OA, and CLBP. We believe that this targeted approach may result in a less heterogeneous patient population in our clinical trials, improve our ability to demonstrate a treatment effect, and, if approved, enable treatment of more appropriate patient populations. 

Orally Administered 

AXS &#8209;02 is a novel oral formulation of zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid is currently marketed only as an intravenous, or IV, preparation and is not currently approved for the treatment of pain. Our oral formulation uses a disodium salt of zoledronic acid, which exhibits substantially improved solubility as compared to the diacid form. This improved solubility may facilitate oral absorption. 

Oral administration is non &#8209;invasive, less costly, more convenient, and less burdensome to patients and prescribers as compared to IV dosing. Oral administration provides greater prescribing flexibility for clinicians and convenience for patients since it allows them to self &#8209;administer the therapy at home and avoid having to travel to and from a hospital or infusion facility. Additionally, based on clinical experience with currently approved bisphosphonates, oral administration of zoledronic acid may have certain safety advantages as compared to IV dosing. 

In a recent trial of 6,097 patients treated over 3 years who received either IV zoledronic acid therapy or oral therapy with alternative bisphosphonates, 76% and 73% of patients indicated a preference for oral versus IV formulations if all agents showed equal efficacy at randomization and therapy completion, respectively. 

Infrequent Dosing and Convenient Regimen 

The potency and pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid may allow for very infrequent dosing and for a short and convenient treatment regimen. Based on the results of our Phase 1 trial, we are currently dosing AXS &#8209;02 once weekly for 6 weeks in our Phase 3 trial for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. Because of its convenient administration and limited treatment duration, we believe that AXS &#8209;02, if successfully developed, may improve compliance and be preferred by patients and their physicians over currently available treatments. 

&#160;

Extended Pain Relief 

AXS &#8209;02 may provide pain relief of long duration based on results of trials conducted with IV &#8209;administered zoledronic acid. In trials in patients with knee OA and BMLs and CLBP associated with MCs, treatment with IV &#8209;administered zoledronic acid resulted in pain relief that was measurable one or more months after cessation of treatment. For example, pain reduction as compared to placebo was demonstrated 6 months after treatment in knee OA, and 1 month after treatment in CLBP. Furthermore, 1 year after treatment, a statistically significant reduction was observed in the percentage of zoledronic acid &#8209;treated patients with CLBP who were taking non &#8209;steroidal anti &#8209;inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, as compared to placebo &#8209;treated patients. This observed extended pain reduction may be related to the potency of zoledronic acid and its long residence time in bone. 

Lack of Opioid &#8209;related Side Effects and Abuse and Addiction Potential 

Reflecting the currently limited treatment options for chronic pain, opioid medications are widely prescribed despite their numerous significant undesirable side effects and potential consequences. These side effects and consequences include dependency, addiction and abuse potential, respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, and a higher incidence of falls and fractures in older patients. Prescription opioids are also increasingly associated with deaths from unintentional overdose, with over 16,000 deaths reported in the United States each year. 

AXS &#8209;02 exerts its potential effects for the treatment of pain via novel non &#8209;opioid mechanisms of action. If successfully developed, AXS &#8209;02 would represent an alternative treatment for pain that lacks the addiction and abuse potential and other serious side effects of opioids. 

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) 

We are developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. There is currently no drug approved by the FDA or the EMA for the treatment of CRPS. AXS &#8209;02 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the EMA for the treatment of CRPS. The FDA has also granted Fast Track designation for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. 

Indication Overview 

CRPS is a disorder characterized by severe, continuous, disabling pain in a limb accompanied by autonomic, sensory, motor, and skin and nail changes. The sensory changes, including allodynia, which is pain invoked by normally non &#8209;painful tactile stimuli, and hyperalgesia, which is greater than normal pain from painful stimuli, are accompanied by movement disorders and joint stiffness. These symptoms are initially confined to a specific limb but can spread beyond the affected limb. Radiographic examination using plain x &#8209;ray, three &#8209;phase bone scan, or MRI often reveal evidence of increased bone turnover in the affected limb. 

The disorder impairs daily functioning and negatively impacts quality of life. For many patients, the pain and associated loss of function result in significant and sometimes permanent disability. Depression is a common comorbidity. CRPS is often triggered by minor trauma, such as wrist fracture, surgery, or needle stick injury, but can occur spontaneously. The extreme nature of the pain is disproportionate to these inciting events. Fracture of the wrist or ankle are the most common inciting events. The disorder affects women 3 to 4 times as frequently as men and its prevalence increases with age. The pathophysiology of CRPS is thought to be multi &#8209;factorial and may include a localized increase in bone turnover, aberrant inflammatory mechanisms, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity. 

Diagnosis of CRPS is made using the International Association for the Study of Pain, or IASP, criteria. It is based on the presence of pain and its characteristics, and the presence of other signs and symptoms. CRPS type 1 is diagnosed if the criteria are seen without evidence of major nerve damage. If seen in the presence of major nerve damage, CRPS type 2, formerly known as causalgia, is diagnosed. CRPS type 1, formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, or RSD, is estimated to account for approximately 97% of all CRPS cases. 

&#160;

It is estimated that there are approximately 80,000 new cases of CRPS in the United States annually. Spontaneous remission is common in some patients. Currently, no medicinal product is approved in either the United States or the European Union for the treatment of CRPS. In addition, current methods for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS are not considered satisfactory. Medicines used for more common pain conditions, such as opioids, NSAIDs, and neuropathic pain medications, are considered to be largely ineffective in CRPS, as demonstrated by controlled trials. Consequently, invasive and expensive palliative interventions, such as IV sympathetic blockades and surgical sympathectomy, are often used with their attendant risk of significant complications. Due to the resistance of the condition to medical therapy, amputation of the affected limb is sometimes performed for the relief of pain. 

Rationale for the Use of AXS &#8209;02 in CRPS 

The rationale for the use of AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS is supported by the pharmacological action of AXS &#8209;02, demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trial, which addresses a common pathophysiological finding in CRPS &#8209;affected limbs, and by positive results in a well &#8209;validated animal study of CRPS. 

Clinical rationale. Increased bone resorption is seen in the affected limbs of the majority of CRPS patients and is manifested by increased tracer uptake on three &#8209;phase bone scan, regional osteoporosis visible on plain x &#8209;ray, and bone marrow edema visible on MRI. Bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, are inhibitors of bone resorption. Bone resorption occurs when bone breaks down and releases minerals into the blood. In our completed Phase 1 trial, oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 to healthy human volunteers resulted in substantial reductions in markers of bone resorption. For example, a single oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 at varying doses resulted in an 80% to 90% reduction in serum CTx, a standard marker of bone resorption, suggesting the potential for AXS &#8209;02 to address a common pathophysiological finding in CRPS &#8209;affected limbs. Furthermore, zoledronic acid localizes preferentially to regions of high bone turnover suggesting it may be able to preferentially target CRPS &#8209;affected limbs. Results of several small clinical trials with other less potent bisphosphonate compounds have shown a reduction in pain in CRPS patients treated with these agents. The pharmacological effect of AXS &#8209;02 shown in our Phase 1 trial may therefore translate to a clinical benefit in CRPS patients. 

Effects of AXS &#8209;02 in the rat tibia fracture model of CRPS. The effect of AXS &#8209;02 was examined in the rat tibia fracture model of CRPS. This well &#8209;validated animal model has been shown to replicate the inciting trauma, natural history, signs, symptoms, and pathologic changes observed in human CRPS patients. We conducted a study with AXS &#8209;02 in this model. After baseline tests, 20 rats underwent a right distal tibia fracture with casting to induce CRPS &#8209;like symptoms and signs. Animals were then orally administered either placebo or AXS &#8209;02 in a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day for 28 days, starting the day after fracture and casting. The casts were removed on the 28th day after fracture, and on the following day, bilateral testing of hindpaw pain thresholds, weight bearing, thickness, and temperature was performed. Hindpaw temperature and thickness data were analyzed as the difference between the affected hindpaw and the normal hindpaw. Weight &#8209;bearing data were analyzed as the ratio between the affected and the normal hindpaw. Weight bearing is a functional measure of pain since the animal is expected to shift its weight off the painful limb. Hindpaw thickness was measured to assess edema, commonly known as swelling. Hindpaw temperature was measured to assess warmth, a symptom of CRPS. 

Oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain, improvement in weight bearing, and prevention of edema as compared to placebo in the rat tibia fracture model of CRPS. Treatment with AXS &#8209;02 reduced pain by 77% and edema by 60% as compared to placebo treatment. AXS &#8209;02 treatment also resulted in a 56% improvement in weight bearing as compared to placebo. The study did not find an effect of AXS &#8209;02 on hindpaw temperature. 

We conducted a second study using the same rat tibia fracture model. In this study, the animals underwent tibia fracture and casting as described above, but dosing of AXS &#8209;02 was started following cast removal and continued for a duration of three weeks. Oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 resulted in a statistically significant reversal of pain and improvement in weight bearing as compared to placebo. Treatment with AXS &#8209;02 reversed pain by approximately 100% versus baseline and improved weight bearing by approximately 13% as compared to placebo. The study did not find an effect of AXS &#8209;02 on edema or hindpaw temperature.

Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) Associated with Bone Marrow Lesions (BMLs) 

We are developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs. There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat this subset of knee OA. The FDA has agreed to an SPA for our planned Phase 3 COAST &#8209;1 study in subjects with knee OA and BMLs. 

Indication Overview 

Knee OA is a disorder characterized by periarticular bone changes, progressive loss of articular cartilage, joint space narrowing, and eventual total joint failure. It is clinically manifested by knee pain, significant physical disability, and reduced quality of life. While currently available drug therapies attempt to address the pain of knee OA, they are not thought to address the cause of the pain. 

Recently, BMLs have been recognized as an important feature of knee OA because of their relation to the pain and pathogenesis of the condition. BMLs appear as areas of increased signal intensity on MRI of the knee, and represent regions of increased subchondral bone turnover. BMLs are clinically relevant because they are associated with and predict knee pain, disease severity, and structural progression in patients with knee OA, based on published studies. Findings from several cross &#8209;sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated that (1) BMLs are strongly associated with the presence and severity of pain in patients with knee OA, (2) new or enlarging BMLs are associated with increased pain and diminishing BMLs with decreased pain, (3) BMLs are associated with progression of joint space narrowing and cartilage loss, (4) BMLs predict knee joint replacement, and (5) increasing BML size is associated with cartilage loss. These studies therefore suggest that BMLs are a source of knee pain and a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention. 

There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs. Currently available therapy for the broader knee OA population include non &#8209;pharmacological treatments, oral and topical medications, and intra &#8209;articular injections. Non &#8209;pharmacological approaches include exercise, weight management, strength training, self &#8209;management, and education. Oral treatments include acetaminophen, selective and non &#8209;selective NSAIDs, and opioid medications. Intra &#8209;articular injections for knee OA include intra &#8209;articular hyaluronic acid, or IAHA, and intra &#8209;articular corticosteroids, or IACS. These treatments are generally short &#8209;acting and may address the symptoms of knee OA, but are not thought to have an effect on the underlying cause of the condition. Knee joint replacement surgery is viewed as a last resort for patients who, despite pharmacological and non &#8209;pharmacological treatment, do not have adequate pain relief and functional improvement. 

Results of epidemiological studies suggest that there are approximately 25 million patients in the United States, 50 years of age and older, with radiographic knee OA. Approximately 12 million of these patients are estimated to be symptomatic, 7 million of whom we estimate have BMLs. 

Rationale for the Use of AXS &#8209;02 in the Pain of Knee OA Associated with BMLs 

The rationale for utilizing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs is based on the observations that (1) BMLs are strongly associated with pain in knee OA, (2) BMLs represent regions of increased subchondral bone turnover and reduced mineral content based on studies of BMLs resected from human subjects, and (3) zoledronic acid potently inhibits bone turnover, increases bone mineral density, and localizes preferentially to regions of increased bone turnover. The pharmacological actions of zoledronic acid therefore suggest the potential for AXS &#8209;02 to affect BMLs, thereby reducing pain in patients with knee OA associated with BMLs. 

Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) Associated with Modic Changes (MCs) 

We are developing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs. There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat this subset of CLBP. 

&#160;

Indication Overview 

CLBP is defined as persistent or fluctuating low back pain lasting at least three months. It is a disabling and costly condition that is associated with increased healthcare utilization. The economic costs of CLBP are estimated to range from $12.2 billion to $90.6 billion annually in the United States. Factors that contribute to this economic impact include prolonged loss of function, consequent loss of work productivity, treatment costs, and disability payments. Low back pain may be due to a specific cause such as fracture, tumor, infection, or nerve root compression. However it is estimated that in more than 85% of cases such specific causes cannot be identified, resulting in the majority of cases being classified as non &#8209;specific. 

Recently, it has been suggested that patients with MCs may represent a specific clinical subgroup of CLBP patients. MCs are vertebral bone marrow changes that are visible on MRI of the spine, and that represent regions of increased bone turnover and pro &#8209;inflammatory mediators. MCs are classified into types 1, 2, or 3, based on radiographic and histological features. MCs are clinically relevant because they are associated with low back pain, based on published studies. Findings from studies in clinical and non &#8209;clinical populations have demonstrated that the presence of MCs, especially type 1 MCs, is correlated with low back pain, predicts persistent symptoms, and sick leaves, and is associated with poor outcomes. These studies therefore suggest that MCs are a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention. 

There is currently no therapy specifically approved by the FDA or the EMA to treat CLBP associated with MCs. Currently available therapy for the broader CLBP population includes non &#8209;pharmacological approaches, such as exercise, and pharmacological treatments, such as NSAIDs and opioid medications. Current pharmacological treatments are generally short &#8209;acting and may address the symptoms of CLBP, but are not thought to have an effect on the underlying cause of the condition. 

Results of epidemiological studies suggest that there are approximately 121 million adults in the United States with low back pain in a given year. Approximately 9 million of these sufferers are estimated to have CLBP, of whom we estimate approximately 1.6 million have type 1 MCs. 

Rationale for the Use of AXS &#8209;02 in CLBP Associated with MCs 

The rationale for utilizing AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs is based on the observations that (1) MCs are associated with low back pain, (2) MCs represent regions of increased bone turnover based on three &#8209;phase bone scans and increased pro &#8209;inflammatory cytokines and vascular density based on analysis of lesions resected from human subjects, and (3) zoledronic acid potently inhibits bone turnover, may reduce pro &#8209;inflammatory cytokine production, is anti &#8209;angiogenic, and localizes preferentially to regions of increased turnover. The pharmacological actions of zoledronic acid therefore suggest the potential for AXS &#8209;02 to affect MCs, thereby reducing pain in patients with CLBP associated with MCs. 

Clinical Development of AXS &#8209;02 

We are developing AXS &#8209;02 and intend to seek FDA approval for the product candidate utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits an applicant to file an NDA that relies, in part, on data not developed by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not received a right of reference, such as the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar drug, or reference listed drug, or published literature, in support of its application. We currently plan to rely on the FDA&#8217;s prior finding of safety and efficacy for IV &#8209;administered zoledronic acid as well as published literature to support our marketing application. 

We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in June 2014 where we presented our clinical development plan for AXS &#8209;02 in the treatment of pain associated with CRPS, the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs, and CLBP associated with MCs. Based on feedback from this meeting and other ongoing communications with the FDA, we plan to conduct two Phase 3 trials with AXS &#8209;02 in the treatment of pain associated with recently diagnosed CRPS, as well as a toxicology study and a food &#8209;effect study, to support an NDA filing for this indication. We requested scientific advice and protocol assistance from the EMA for the development of AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. We 

&#160;

received final advice from the EMA in March 2015. Based on this advice, we believe that only one successful Phase 3 trial in CRPS will be required to support a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for AXS &#8209;02 in this indication. 

In May 2013, we received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CRPS. This designation may entitle AXS &#8209;02 to a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the treatment of CRPS in the United States upon FDA approval. We submitted an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, sponsored by us, in October 2013 for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. 

In October 2013, we received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation from the EMA for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of CRPS. Orphan Medicinal Product Designation provides ten years of potential market exclusivity in the European Union if the designated product candidate is approved for the indication for which it is designated and the orphan designation is maintained. Additionally, if a Pediatric Investigation Plan is completed, an additional two years of exclusivity in the European Union could be granted for a product with Orphan Medicinal Product Designation. 

In August 2014, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. The FDA&#8217;s Fast Track designation program is designed to aid in the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life &#8209;threatening conditions. In order to receive Fast Track designation, a product candidate must also demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation provides greater access to, and more frequent communication with, the FDA throughout the entire drug development and review process, with the goal of getting important new drugs to patients more rapidly. It also provides the opportunity to submit sections of an NDA on a rolling basis, where the FDA may review portions of the NDA as they are received instead of waiting for the entire NDA submission. In addition, Fast Track designated product candidates may be eligible for priority review at the time of NDA submission. 

In October 2015, we reached agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial with AXS &#8209;02 for the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs. An SPA documents the FDA&#8217;s agreement that the design and planned analysis of a clinical trial adequately address scientific and regulatory objectives that, if met, would support a regulatory submission for approval of a drug. 

We completed oral toxicology studies in the rat and dog models to support the dosing of AXS &#8209;02 in our completed Phase 1 trial and in our ongoing and planned Phase 3 trials. Dose &#8209;limiting adverse effects were primarily gastrointestinal related. We have completed a Phase 1 trial of AXS &#8209;02 to characterize the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid and its effects on markers of bone resorption after oral administration of AXS &#8209;02. In this trial, oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 tablets resulted in rapid absorption of zoledronic acid and marked suppression of bone resorption markers. 

The potential effect of zoledronic acid on the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs has been demonstrated in a Phase 2, investigator &#8209;initiated, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial. In this trial, IV administration of zoledronic acid resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain and BML size at 6 months. The potential effect of zoledronic acid in CLBP associated with MCs has been demonstrated in a Phase 2, investigator &#8209;initiated, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial. In this trial, IV administration of zoledronic acid resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain at 1 month and NSAID use at 12 months. We have obtained exclusive rights to the data generated from this trial in CLBP. 

We are currently conducting a randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled Phase 3 trial of AXS &#8209;02 in patients with CRPS. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial in patients with knee OA and BMLs in the first quarter of 2016, and a Phase 3 trial in patients with CLBP associated with MCs in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. We believe our planned Phase 3 dosing of AXS &#8209;02 will provide cumulative systemic exposure of zoledronic acid that is similar to that achieved with the 5 mg IV dose used in the Phase 2 trials in knee OA and CLBP, based on the results of our completed Phase 1 trial. 

Completed Phase 1 Trial of AXS &#8209;02 

We conducted a Phase 1 trial to assess the fasting pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of orally administered AXS &#8209;02 tablets in healthy adult male and postmenopausal female volunteers under a Health 

&#160;

Canada Clinical Trial Application. The trial was a randomized, open &#8209;label, partial crossover study in a total of 36 subjects. Each subject received two of the following four treatments: three varying oral doses of AXS &#8209;02 or a 1 mg IV dose of zoledronic acid. Each treatment was separated by a wash &#8209;out period of at least 14 days. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and after dosing to measure zoledronic acid plasma concentrations and the effect of AXS &#8209;02 on biomarkers of bone resorption, including serum CTx. 

Zoledronic acid was rapidly absorbed after oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 tablets with median time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, or T max , of 30 to 45 minutes. The absolute oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid after administration of AXS &#8209;02 tablets found in this trial was greater than that reported for oral bisphosphonate agents currently marketed in the United States, based on FDA package inserts. Zoledronic acid plasma concentrations after oral administration of AXS &#8209;02, measured using area under the plasma concentration curve, or AUC, and maximum plasma concentration, or C max , were found to be dose proportional in the range tested using the power model. 

Oral administration of AXS &#8209;02 resulted in marked reductions of biomarkers of bone resorption. For example, levels of serum CTx were reduced by approximately 80 to 90% seven days after dosing. This effect was generally maintained 14 to 15 days after dosing. &#160; There were no reported serious adverse events in the trial. The majority of treatment &#8209;emergent adverse events experienced were graded as mild or moderate in severity, were transient in nature, and were completely resolved by the end of the study. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, fever, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, myalgia, and chills. Adverse events were reported more frequently with increasing oral doses, and more frequently in the oral dose groups than in the IV dose group. 

Phase 2 of Zoledronic Acid in the Pain of Knee OA Associated with BMLs 

IV &#8209;administered zoledronic acid, the active molecule in AXS &#8209;02, was tested in an investigator &#8209;initiated, single &#8209;center, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial in patients with knee OA and BMLs. In this trial, zoledronic acid treatment reduced pain and BML size, as further described below, demonstrating an effect on symptom and structure. The design and results of this trial have been reported in a peer &#8209;reviewed journal. 

In the trial, 59 patients, aged 50 to 80 years, with clinical knee OA and knee BMLs on MRI were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single 5 &#8209;mg IV infusion of zoledronic acid or placebo. BMLs were determined using proton density &#8209;weighted fat saturation magnetic resonance images at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Pain intensity was measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months using a 100 &#8209;mm visual analogue scale, or VAS, which is a standard clinical measurement for pain severity. Total BML area was measured in square millimeters at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcomes were the change from baseline to 6 months in pain intensity as measured by the VAS, and maximal area of BML measured at 6 months. Participants were allowed to remain on their background pain medications but the dose was kept constant through the trial period where possible. One subject randomized to placebo received zoledronic acid. Therefore, data for this patient was included in the zoledronic acid arm in the analyses and results discussed below. This analysis is referred to as a per protocol analysis. 

At baseline, the mean VAS score was 54 mm. There was a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity, measured using the VAS, from baseline to 6 months in the zoledronic acid &#8209;treated group as compared to placebo, using the per protocol analysis. Changes in pain intensity between baseline and the other time points were numerically greater in the zoledronic acid arm than in the placebo arm but were not statistically significant. &#160; T here was a statistically significant reduction in BML area at 6 months in the zoledronic acid &#8209;treated group as compared to placebo. At the 12 month assessment, the changes in BML size were lower in magnitude in the zoledronic acid arm as compared to the placebo arm and were not statistically significant. &#160; The most commonly reported adverse events were acute phase reactions, which are primarily cold or flu &#8209;like symptoms and headaches. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the zoledronic acid &#8209;treated group. Serious adverse events were primarily non &#8209;elective hospital admissions, none of which were considered causally related to study drug. 

Phase 2 of Zoledronic Acid in CLBP Associated with MCs 

IV &#8209;administered zoledronic acid was tested in an investigator &#8209;initiated, single &#8209;center, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial in patients with CLBP associated with MCs. In this trial, zoledronic acid treatment resulted in 

&#160;

statistically significant reductions in pain at 1 month and NSAID use at 12 months. We have exclusive rights to reference these trial data. 

In the trial, 40 patients, with a mean age of approximately 50 years, with low back pain lasting at least 3 months and MCs on MRI, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single 5 &#8209;mg IV infusion of zoledronic acid or placebo. MCs were determined on MRI performed within 6 months prior to enrollment. Other inclusion criteria included pain intensity of at least 6 cm on a 10 &#8209;cm VAS or an Oswestry Disability Index, or ODI, of at least 30%. Low back pain intensity was measured at screening and 1 and 12 months after infusion using a 10 &#8209;cm VAS. The primary outcome was the change in low back pain intensity as measured by the VAS. Pain medication use was inquired about during study visits. 

Study participants had a mean low back pain duration of 293 days at study entry, and initial low back pain intensity of 6.7 on the VAS. All patients displayed either type 1, type 2, or mixed type 1 and type 2 MCs on MRI. There was a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity, measured using the VAS, at 1 month in the zoledronic acid &#8209;treated group as compared to placebo. Changes in pain intensity at 12 months were numerically greater in the zoledronic acid arm than in the placebo arm but were not statistically significant. &#160; At 1 year only 20% of patients in the zoledronic acid treatment group reported using NSAIDs compared to 60% of patients in the placebo group. At baseline, there were no differences in self &#8209;reported use of NSAIDs between the treatment groups. &#160; The most commonly reported adverse events were acute phase reactions, which occurred more frequently in the zoledronic acid &#8209;treated group. The majority of the acute phase reactions were rated mild to moderate in severity and typically resolved within three days of onset. Sinusitis requiring temporary hospitalization following zoledronic acid infusion was reported in one patient and was therefore classified as a serious adverse event. 

Ongoing and Planned Phase 3 Trials of AXS &#8209;02 in CRPS 

Ongoing CREATE &#8209;1 Study 

In July 2015, we initiated the CREATE &#8209;1 study, a Phase 3, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;02 in the treatment of pain associated with CRPS. Eligible patients must be at least 18 years of age, with recently diagnosed CRPS type 1 according to the International Association for the Study of Pain, or IASP, diagnostic criteria, and an average weekly baseline pain intensity in the affected limb of at least 5 on an 11 &#8209;point (0 &#8209;10) numeric rating scale, or NRS. In addition, the CRPS must have been precipitated by traumatic injury to the affected limb, for example, fracture, crushing injury, or orthopedic surgery. We expect to complete this trial by the end of 2017. 

After a baseline period, patients meeting the entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to orally receive either (1) AXS &#8209;02 tablets once per week for 6 weeks, or (2) matching placebo tablets once per week for 6 weeks. Patients will receive drug or placebo under fasting conditions, which is typical for oral bisphosphonates. Randomized patients will remain blinded for an additional 6 weeks, totaling 12 weeks for the double &#8209;blind phase. The primary endpoint will be the change in pain intensity from baseline to week 12, measured using the NRS. Patients will be followed for an additional 12 weeks after the double &#8209;blind period. We anticipate that the study will enroll a total of approximately 190 patients. An interim analysis for efficacy is planned on the first approximately 50% of patients who are enrolled and who complete the double &#8209;blind phase, and is anticipated around the end of 2016. 

Additional Planned Phase 3 Trial in CRPS 

We plan to conduct a second Phase 3 trial in patients with recently diagnosed CRPS. The design and entry criteria for this trial will be similar to those of the CREATE &#8209;1 trial with the exception that it will incorporate three treatment arms instead of two. After a baseline period, patients meeting the entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (1) AXS &#8209;02 tablets once per week for 6 weeks, (2) AXS &#8209;02 tablets once per week for 3 weeks and matching placebo tablets for the following 3 weeks, or (3) matching placebo tablets once per week for 6 weeks. Randomized patients will remain blinded for an additional 6 weeks, totaling 12 weeks for the double &#8209;blind phase. The primary endpoint will be the change in pain intensity from baseline to week 12, measured using the NRS. We anticipate that the trial will enroll a total of approximately 285 patients. 

&#160;

Planned Phase 3 Trial in the Pain of Knee OA Associated with BMLs, the COAST &#8209;1 Study 

We intend to initiate a Phase 3, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;02 in the treatment of the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs, which we refer to as the COAST &#8209;1 study. This trial is anticipated to enroll approximately 346 patients with clinically diagnosed knee OA and at least one confirmed BML in the affected knee on MRI. Eligible patients must be at least 50 years of age, either male or postmenopausal female, and have at least moderate pain intensity. After a baseline period, patients meeting the entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either (1) AXS &#8209;02 tablets once per week or (2) matching placebo tablets once per week, under fasting conditions for 6 weeks. Randomized patients will remain blinded for an additional 18 weeks, totaling 24 weeks for the double &#8209;blind phase. The primary endpoint is anticipated to be the change in pain intensity from baseline to week 24, measured using the NRS. We plan to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2016. 

Planned Phase 3 Trial in CLBP Associated with MCs 

We intend to initiate a Phase 3, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;02 in the treatment of CLBP associated with MCs. This trial is anticipated to enroll patients with low back pain lasting at least 3 months and confirmed type 1 or mixed type 1 and type 2 MCs on MRI. After a baseline period, patients meeting the entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either (1) AXS &#8209;02 tablets once per week or (2) matching placebo tablets once per week, under fasting conditions for 6 weeks. Randomized patients will remain blinded for an additional 6 weeks, totaling 12 weeks for the double &#8209;blind phase. The primary endpoint is anticipated to be the change in pain intensity from baseline to week 12, measured using the NRS. We anticipate that the trial will enroll a total of approximately 300 patients. We plan to initiate this trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017. 

AXS &#8209;05 

Overview 

AXS &#8209;05 is an innovative fixed &#8209;dose combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion under development for the treatment of CNS disorders. DM is active at multiple CNS receptors but is rapidly metabolized into dextrorphan, or DXO, when dosed alone. Our combination uses bupropion as a novel drug delivery method to inhibit DM metabolism and increase its bioavailability. Bupropion itself is also active at distinct CNS receptors. The activity of the two components may provide an additive or synergistic effect. 

AXS &#8209;05 is potentially applicable to the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders, based on the mechanisms of action of its two components. We are developing AXS &#8209;05 initially as a therapeutic for treatment resistant depression and agitation in patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. 

&#160;

Scientific Rationale 

DM and bupropion each target different CNS receptor systems that are potentially relevant to the treatment of CNS disorders. Combining the distinct and independent mechanisms of action of these two compounds may be additive or synergistic in the treatment of depression and other CNS disorders. However, as shown in the figure above, DM is quickly eliminated from the body following administration due to extensive first pass metabolism, which results in low blood levels even at high doses. Attainment of potential therapeutic plasma levels of DM is therefore difficult when DM is dosed as a single agent. We have demonstrated in two Phase 1 trials that co &#8209;administration of bupropion and DM leads to substantially increased DM plasma levels. This positive pharmacokinetic interaction between bupropion and DM therefore may enable DM&#8217;s clinical utility by increasing DM&#8217;s plasma levels into a potentially therapeutic range. We believe this dual pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic synergy results in a unique pharmacological profile that could potentially be efficacious in CNS disorders. 

Bupropion is a well &#8209;characterized antidepressant that is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or other known antidepressant agents. It is an inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase or the reuptake of serotonin. It is the only antidepressant currently available that is capable of selectively inhibiting both dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. Bupropion was approved in the United States in 1985 and is marketed under the trade name Wellbutrin for the treatment of major depressive disorder, or MDD, and under the trade name Zyban as an aid to smoking cessation. 

DM is a noncompetitive N &#8209;methyl &#8209;D &#8209;aspartate, or NMDA, receptor antagonist, a sigma &#8209;1 receptor agonist, and an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter, or SERT, and norepinephrine transporter, or NET. Each of these mechanisms of action has been shown to be associated with antidepressant response. DM is a well &#8209;known agent that is used as an ingredient in over &#8209;the &#8209;counter cough and cold preparations. DM, in combination with quinidine, was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect, also known as emotional lability. Like bupropion in our product candidate, quinidine is used to inhibit the metabolism of DM and increase its plasma concentrations. Unlike bupropion, however, the quinidine in the preparation does not have CNS activity. 

Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) 

We are developing AXS &#8209;05 for the treatment of TRD. Currently only one product, Symbyax, a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, is approved in the United States for the treatment of TRD. 

&#160;

Indication Overview 

Patients diagnosed with MDD are defined as having TRD if they have failed two or more antidepressant therapies. MDD is a serious condition characterized by depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a two &#8209;week period, and which impairs social, occupational, educational, or other important functioning. MDD is highly prevalent and difficult to treat. According to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, an estimated 6.7% of U.S. adults experience MDD each year, while 3.3% of individuals 13 to 18 years of age experience a seriously debilitating depressive disorder. Results of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, or STAR*D trial, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, indicate that nearly two &#8209;thirds of diagnosed and treated patients do not experience adequate treatment response with first &#8209;line therapy, and that the majority of these initial failures also fail second &#8209;line treatment. Based on these observations, we estimate that there are approximately 3 million patients with TRD in the United States. 

Rationale for the Use of AXS &#8209;05 in TRD 

The rationale for the use of AXS &#8209;05 in TRD is based on the mechanisms of action of DM, preclinical evidence of antidepressant effects of DM, preliminary clinical evidence of antidepressant effects of DM when co &#8209;administered with an inhibitor of its metabolism, and the established clinical efficacy of bupropion in MDD. 

Mechanistic rationale. DM&#8217;s mechanisms of action encompass those of several currently marketed antidepressant drugs such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), fluoxetine (Prozac), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and is a nicotinic acetylocholine receptor antagonist. The distinct mechanisms of action of DM and bupropion may therefore be complementary. Additionally we believe that, if successfully developed, the NMDA receptor antagonist properties of DM in AXS &#8209;05 may potentially result in a faster onset of action than currently available antidepressant treatments. 

Preclinical rationale. The effects of DM have been reported in two preclinical models of antidepressant effect. In the forced swim test model in mice, DM administered intraperitoneally resulted in antidepressant &#8209;like effects in a dose &#8209;dependent manner. The forced swim test is considered to be the most well &#8209;validated animal model for predicting antidepressant effect. Using the tail suspension test in mice, another widely used behavioral test for assessing antidepressant potential, DM was also shown to display antidepressant &#8209;like effects similar to those seen with imipramine, a conventional antidepressant, and ketamine, a compound that has demonstrated fast &#8209;acting antidepressant effects. In both models, inhibition of DM metabolism using quinidine was shown to potentiate the antidepressant &#8209;like effects. 

Clinical Rationale. Administration of DM with an inhibitor of its metabolism has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, measured using the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition, or BDI &#8209;II, in a third &#8209;party study. In a 326 &#8209;patient, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled trial in patients with pseudobulbar affect, co &#8209;administration of DM and the metabolic inhibitor quinidine resulted in a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms as compared to placebo at the 30 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine dose at 12 weeks. Patients were excluded from the study if their BDI &#8209;II score was greater than 19, with a score in the range of 0 to 13 corresponding to minimal depression and 14 to 19 corresponding to mild depression. Assessment of depressive symptoms was a pre &#8209;specified secondary endpoint in this trial. 

According to the FDA package insert for the combination of DM and quinidine (Nuedexta), DM is the pharmacologically active ingredient of the DM / quinidine combination that acts on the CNS, with quinidine serving to increase DM plasma levels. The plasma concentrations of DM, measured using AUC 0 &#8209;12 and C max , achieved with AXS &#8209;05 administration in our Phase 1 trials are in the range of those associated with a 30 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine dose, based on data published by the FDA. 

Agitation in Patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) 

We intend to develop AXS &#8209;05 for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD. There is currently no FDA &#8209;approved pharmacological treatment for the indication of agitation in patients with AD. 

&#160;

Indication Overview 

AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that manifests initially as forgetfulness advancing to severe cognitive impairment and memory loss. It is a common form of dementia and afflicts an estimated 5 million individuals in the United States, a number that is anticipated to increase to approximately 14 million by 2050. In addition to cognitive decline, individuals diagnosed with AD typically experience behavioral and psychological symptoms including agitation and aggression. These symptoms are seen in a high percentage of AD sufferers with agitation being reported in as many as 40% of patients. Agitation is characterized by emotional distress, aggressive behaviors, disruptive irritability, and disinhibition. Agitation in patients with AD has been associated with increased caregiver burden, decreased functioning, earlier nursing home placement, and death. 

Because there are no FDA &#8209;approved pharmacological treatments for the indication of agitation in patients with AD, patients are currently treated off &#8209;label with various agents including antipsychotics, which have been considered the mainstay of treatment. These treatments however are limited by safety concerns. Typical antipsychotics prescribed for agitation, aggression, or insomnia are associated with functional decline in patients with AD, while studies indicate that atypical antipsychotics may be associated with increased rates of cerebrovascular events in patients with dementia. 

Rationale for the Development of AXS &#8209;05 in Agitation in Patients with AD 

The rationale for the use of AXS &#8209;05 for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD is based on the mechanisms of action of DM, and preliminary clinical evidence of the effect of DM when co &#8209;administered with an inhibitor of its metabolism in agitation in patients with AD. 

Mechanistic rationale. Mechanisms of action of DM include NMDA receptor antagonism and sigma &#8209;1 receptor agonism. Altered glutamate transmission via NMDA receptors has been suggested to play a role in behavioral changes in dementia, and clinical evidence suggests that NMDA antagonism may reduce agitation and aggression in AD patients. The pharmacologic action of agents used in the treatment of dementia, such as donepezil, and behavioral disorders, such as fluvoxamine, include sigma &#8209;1 receptor agonism. 

Clinical Rationale. Administration of DM with an inhibitor of its metabolism has been shown to result in a statistically significant reduction in agitation in patients with AD. The effects of DM co &#8209;administered with the metabolic inhibitor quinidine was studied in a third &#8209;party, randomized, double &#8209;blind, placebo &#8209;controlled, two &#8209;stage trial in 220 patients with probable AD and clinically meaningful agitation. In stage 1 of the study, patients were randomized to receive either placebo or DM with quinidine (20 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine once per day, titrated to 30 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine twice per day). In stage 2, patients initially on placebo were stratified according to response, then re &#8209;randomized to placebo or active treatment (titrated as in stage 1). Each stage lasted five weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the agitation/aggression domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, or NPI, assessed by combining results from the two stages. 

The primary endpoint showed a statistically significant improvement with DM and quinidine as compared to placebo. A statistically significantly greater reduction in the agitation/aggression domain of the NPI for active treatment as compared to placebo was seen in both stage 1 as well as in stage 2 of the study. An experimental result, such as those derived from a clinical or non-clinical study, is statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The statistical significance of experimental results is determined by a widely used statistical method that establishes the P value of the results. A P value is a statistical measure of the probability that the difference in results between treatment and control groups in a study could have occurred by chance. Under this method, the smaller the P value the greater the confidence that the results are significant, and a P value of 0.05 or less is generally considered by the FDA to represent statistical significance. During stage 1, a reduction of 3.3 in the agitation/aggression domain of the NPI was seen for active treatment as compared to a reduction of 1.7 for placebo, with a P value that is less than 0.001. During stage 2, a reduction of 2.0 was observed for active treatment as compared to a reduction of 0.8 for placebo, with a P value that is equal to 0.02. Average baseline values for the agitation/aggression domain of the NPI were 7.1 for the active treatment group and 7.0 for the placebo group. Statistically significant improvements for the active treatment arm compared to placebo were also reported for the majority of secondary endpoints including the NPI total score, NPI &#8209;Caregiver Distress 

&#160;

Score, Caregiver Strain Index, and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Moreover, treatment with DM and the metabolic inhibitor was not associated with cognitive decline as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination. 

In the trial, patients were titrated to a 30 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine dose. According to the FDA package insert for Nuedexta, DM is the pharmacologically active ingredient of the DM / quinidine combination that acts on the CNS, with quinidine serving to increase DM plasma levels. The plasma concentrations of DM, measured using AUC 0 &#8209;12 and C max , achieved with AXS &#8209;05 administration in our Phase 1 trials are in the range of those associated with a 30 mg DM / 10 mg quinidine dose, based on data published by the FDA. 

Clinical Development of AXS &#8209;05 

We are developing AXS &#8209;05 and intend to seek FDA approval for the product utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. We have completed two Phase 1 pharmacokinetic clinical trials of AXS &#8209;05 under clinical trial applications with Health Canada. In both studies, administration of bupropion in combination with DM resulted in a substantial increase in DM plasma concentrations measured using C max and AUC at all doses tested. 

We held a pre &#8209;IND meeting with the FDA in February 2015 where we discussed our clinical development plan for AXS &#8209;05 in TRD. Based on that meeting, we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA and we plan to conduct two Phase 3 trials of AXS &#8209;05 in TRD to support an NDA filing for this indication. 

In March 2016, we initiated the STRIDE-1 study, a Phase 3, randomized, double &#8209;blind, active &#8209;controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;05 in the treatment of TRD. We plan to meet with the FDA this year to discuss our plans to conduct a controlled trial of AXS &#8209;05 in agitation in patients with AD. 

Completed Phase 1 Trials of AXS &#8209;05 

We have completed two Phase 1 pharmacokinetic clinical trials of AXS &#8209;05. The objectives of these trials were to assess the pharmacokinetics of DM when co &#8209;administered with bupropion, and to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. In these Phase 1 trials, the components of AXS &#8209;05, DM and bupropion, were co &#8209;administered as separate tablets. In both studies, administration of bupropion in combination with DM resulted in substantial increases in DM plasma concentrations measured using C max and AUC at all doses tested. 

The first Phase 1 trial was a randomized, multiple &#8209;dose, open &#8209;label study to determine the pharmacokinetics of DM when various doses of DM are administered concomitantly with bupropion under fasting conditions, as well as the safety of the combination. Subjects were randomized to receive twice &#8209;daily administrations of 150 mg of bupropion in combination with DM at various doses up to 60 mg, or 60 mg of DM alone, for 8 consecutive days. Bupropion was titrated with subjects being dosed once daily for the first 3 days, then twice daily thereafter. A total of 32 healthy, adult volunteers were included in this study in four treatment groups. Full pharmacokinetic assessments were made on Day 1 and Day 8. For the dose of 60 mg of DM / 150 mg of bupropion, AUC 0 &#8209;12 and C max values on Day 8 for DM when dosed in combination with bupropion were approximately 60 times and 40 times, respectively, the values for DM when dosed alone. For all doses tested, administration of DM in combination with bupropion resulted in substantial increases in AUC 0 &#8209;12 and C max values of DM on Day 8 as compared to Day 1 of dosing. DM exposure measured using AUC and C max increased in a dose dependent manner with increasing doses of DM. Administration of DM did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion. 

There were no reported serious adverse events in the trial. The majority of treatment &#8209;emergent adverse events experienced were graded as mild or moderate in severity, and had resolved by the end of the study. The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness, nausea, headache, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, hypoesthesia, palpitation, disturbance in attention, tremor, and hyperhidrosis. Adverse events were reported more frequently in the AXS &#8209;05 arm as compared to the DM &#8209;only arm. The majority of these adverse events were expected with the administration of bupropion, having been already reported in the FDA package inserts for products containing bupropion. 

The second Phase 1 trial was a randomized, multiple &#8209;dose, open &#8209;label study to determine the pharmacokinetics of DM when various doses of DM are administered concomitantly with various doses of bupropion and to assess safety 

&#160;

during co &#8209;administration of bupropion and DM. A total of 40 healthy, adult volunteers were included in this study in five treatment groups. Subjects were randomized to receive twice &#8209;daily administration of either 150 mg of bupropion alone, or combinations of varying doses of bupropion and DM for 8 consecutive days. Bupropion was titrated with subjects being dosed once daily for the first 3 days, then twice daily thereafter. Full pharmacokinetic assessments were made on Day 1 and Day 8. Similar to the results in our first study, administration of DM in combination with bupropion resulted in substantial increases in AUC 0 &#8209;12 and C max values of DM on Day 8 as compared to Day 1 of dosing for all combinations tested. DM exposure measured using AUC and C max increased in a dose &#8209;dependent manner as doses of either DM or bupropion were increased. Administration of DM did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion. 

There were no reported serious adverse events in the trial. The majority of treatment &#8209;emergent adverse events experienced were graded as mild in severity, and had resolved by the end of the study. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, increased heart rate, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, increased blood pressure, and tremor. No particular trend was observed when comparing the rates or types of adverse events in the combination groups as compared to the group receiving bupropion alone. 

Ongoing STRIDE-1 Study 

In March 2016, we initiated a Phase 3, randomized, double &#8209;blind, active &#8209;controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;05 in the treatment of TRD. Patients with MDD who have previously failed one or two antidepressant treatments will be treated in an open &#8209;label fashion with bupropion during a 6 &#8209;week lead &#8209;in period. Patients who fail to respond to bupropion during this lead &#8209;in period will be considered to have TRD and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bupropion or AXS &#8209;05 in a double &#8209;blind fashion for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint is anticipated to be the change in the Montgomery &#8209;Asberg Depression Rating Scale after 6 weeks of treatment. We anticipate that the trial will enroll a total of approximately 346 randomized patients. 

Planned Phase 3 Trial of AXS &#8209;05 in Agitation in Patients with AD 

We plan to meet with the FDA this year to discuss our development plans for AXS &#8209;05 in agitation in patients with AD. Pending the results of this meeting, we intend to conduct a controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of AXS &#8209;05 in AD patients with agitation. 

Preclinical Programs 

We have one active program, AXS &#8209;06, in preclinical development. We are currently conducting formulation work for this program. Following formulation, we plan to conduct a preclinical study to assess the pharmacokinetics of AXS &#8209;06 prior to potentially advancing it into clinical trials. 

Commercial Agreements 

We have customary clinical supply agreements and customary agreements with clinical research organizations to help manage our clinical trials. Each of our commercial agreements are non &#8209;exclusive, and we have no material contractual obligations under such agreements, except to the extent we order supply or request services to be performed. 

Material License Agreements 

In 2012, we entered into three exclusive license agreements with Antecip Bioventures II LLC, or Antecip, an entity owned by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Herriot Tabuteau, M.D., in which we were granted exclusive licenses to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Antecip&#8217;s patents and applications related to the development of AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05, as well as AXS &#8209;04, a product candidate that is currently in early stage development, anywhere in the world for veterinary and human therapeutic and diagnostic use. The agreements were amended in August 2015 to update the schedule of patents and applications subject to the license agreements. Pursuant to the agreements, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize AXS &#8209;02, AXS &#8209;05, and AXS &#8209;04. Under the terms of the agreements, we are required to pay to Antecip a royalty equal to 4.5% for AXS &#8209;02, 3.0% for AXS &#8209;05, and 1.5% for AXS &#8209;04, of net sales of products containing the 

&#160;

licensed technology by us, our affiliates, or permitted sublicensees. These royalty payments are subject to reduction by an amount up to 50.0% of any required payments to third parties. Unless earlier terminated by a party for cause or by us for convenience, the agreements remain in effect on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product and country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis until the later to occur of (1) the applicable product is no longer covered by a valid claim in that country or (2) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in that country. Upon expiration of the agreements with respect to a product in a country, our license grant for that product in that country will become a fully paid &#8209;up, royalty &#8209;free, perpetual non &#8209;exclusive license. If Antecip terminates any of the agreements for cause, or if we exercise our right to terminate any of the agreements for convenience, the rights granted to us under such terminated agreement will revert to Antecip. To date, we have not been required to make any payments to Antecip under any of the license agreements. 

Intellectual Property 

We seek to protect our product candidates and our technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know &#8209;how, FDA and EMA exclusivity, and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Our policy is to pursue, maintain, and defend patent rights whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and to protect the proprietary position of our product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. U.S. patents generally have a term of 20 years from the earliest effective date of the application. 

As of March 22, 2016, our intellectual property portfolio contains 27 issued patents and 5 allowed and more than 45 pending applications in the United States and worldwide. Twenty-one issued patents and 3 allowed and more than 20 pending patent applications covering our AXS &#8209;02 product candidate, and related compounds, have claims covering method of delivery, pharmacokinetics, composition of matter, and methods of use with protection extending through 2034 for both our issued patents and pending applications. In addition to patent protections, our AXS &#8209;02 program, if approved, may also be afforded potential exclusivity by the FDA&#8217;s and EMA &#8217;s orphan drug designation programs for CRPS, which provide 7 years and 10 to 12 years of exclusivity, respectively. Six issued patents and 2 allowed and more than 10 pending patent applications covering our AXS &#8209;05 product candidate have claims covering pharmaceutical composition, drug delivery, and pharmacokinetics with protection extending through 2034 for our issued and allowed patents, as well as our pending applications. An &#8220;allowed&#8221; patent application is one which, having been examined by the USPTO, is approved to issue as a patent, subject to payment of the issue fee by the applicant. Its status as an &#8220;allowed&#8221; patent application continues from the date of the notice of allowance until it is withdrawn from issue, it issues as a patent, or it becomes abandoned. We have pending PCT applications, as well as pending applications in Australia , Canada , China , Europe, Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea , and New Zealand . We have other patent applications with claims covering the other programs in our pipeline, including those that are not relevant to our current programs in development. We have licensed the patents and pending applications which cover AXS &#8209;02, AXS &#8209;04, and AXS &#8209;05 from Antecip. All of the other components of our intellectual property portfolio are owned by Axsome. 

Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of pain and CNS disorders and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. In order to contend with the inevitable possibility of third &#8209;party intellectual property conflicts, from time to time we review and assess the third &#8209;party intellectual property landscape for competitive and other developments that may inform or impact our intellectual property development and commercialization strategies. With respect to third &#8209;party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our product candidates or discovery platform will be free of claims by third &#8209;party intellectual property holders or whether we will require licenses from such third parties. Even with modern databases and on &#8209;line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third &#8209;party patent is identified, we may conclude, upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third &#8209;party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, we might have patent litigation forced upon us. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third &#8209;party patent invalid or not infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our discovery platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us. This could have a material adverse effect on our 

&#160;

business. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know &#8209;how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know &#8209;how, by requiring our employees to execute Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non &#8209;Solicitation, and Non &#8209;Competition Agreements upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property, or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials. 

Sales and Marketing 

We intend to build a commercial infrastructure in the United States in advance of anticipated drug approval of our product candidates. We believe that we can cost &#8209;effectively implement a targeted sales force required to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS, the pain of knee OA associated with BMLs, and CLBP associated with MCs. Support for this team will include sales management, internal sales support, distribution support, and an internal marketing group. Additional requisite capabilities will include focused management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, and government accounts. We may seek co &#8209;promotion partners for our sales efforts to reach other United States physician groups, such as primary care physicians. We believe that there are significant market opportunities for our products outside of the United States. As a result, we plan to seek strategic partnerships with third parties, which may have greater reach and resources by virtue of their size and experience in the field, for the development and commercialization of our products outside the United States. We may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In order to implement this infrastructure, we will have to allocate management resources and make significant financial investments including some prior to product approval. 

Scientific Advisors 

In March 2015, we formed a Depression Scientific Advisory Board, or SAB, composed of leading experts in the areas of depression, FDA regulations, and clinical trial design. These experts provide key scientific, clinical, and strategic guidance concerning our development programs in depression and other CNS disorders. The following members were appointed to our Depression SAB: Maurizio Fava, M.D., Director of the Clinical Research Program and Executive Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Slater Family Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School; Thomas Laughren, M.D., retired Division Director of the FDA&#8217;s Division of Psychiatry Products; and Dan Iosifescu, M.D., Director of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program and Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Consultant in Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. We also benefit from the guidance of our other scientific advisors in the areas of CRPS, knee OA, CLBP, and pain clinical trial design. 

Competition 

Overview 

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large size and expanding scope of the pain and CNS markets make them attractive therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical businesses. Our potential competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies. While we believe that our employees and consultants, scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Several of these entities have robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and 

&#160;

development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third &#8209;party payors. 

AXS &#8209;02 Competition 

There are no drugs approved by the FDA or the EMA for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS, although various classes of pain medications, such as NSAIDs and opioids, are used off &#8209;label. We are aware of other companies working to develop therapeutics for the treatment of pain associated with CRPS, including Grunenthal GmbH and Thar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Companies working to develop therapeutics for the treatment of pain associated with knee OA include Carbylan Therapeutics, Inc.; Flexion Therapeutics, Inc.; and Levolta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is developing an IV zoledronic acid product for the treatment of knee OA. We are aware of two companies attempting to develop oral dosage forms of zoledronic acid for various indications, Merrion Pharmaceuticals plc and Thar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

AXS &#8209;05 Competition 

There is one product approved for the treatment of TRD, Symbyax, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company. In addition, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. is working to develop a combination of DM and quinidine for the treatment of TRD. We are aware of several other companies developing compounds for the treatment of TRD including Alkermes plc; Allergan plc; and Janssen Research &#38; Development, LLC. We are aware of other companies working to develop therapeutics for the treatment of agitation in patients with AD, including Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., which is working to develop a combination of DM and quinidine in this indication, and Transition Therapeutics Inc. 

Manufacturing 

Manufacturing of drugs and product candidates, including AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05, must comply with FDA current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations. AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05 comprise synthetic small molecules made through a series of organic chemistry steps starting with commercially available organic chemical raw materials. We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates. We conduct manufacturing activities under individual purchase orders with independent contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to supply our clinical trials. We conduct periodic quality audits of their facilities. We believe that our existing suppliers of AXS &#8209;02 and AXS &#8209;05 active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products will be capable of providing sufficient quantities of each to meet our clinical trial supply needs. Other CMOs may be used in the future for clinical supplies and, subject to approval, commercial manufacturing. 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import, and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. In addition, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

FDA Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site or centrally, before each trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidates for its intended use, performed in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; 

&#8226; development of manufacturing processes to ensure the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, and purity; 

&#8226; submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites and selected clinical investigators to determine GCP compliance; and 

&#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use. 

Preclinical Studies and IND Submission 

The testing and approval process of product candidates requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. In the case of 505(b)(2) applications, though, some of the IND components may not be required. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. 

An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 &#8209;day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and 

&#160;

places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, as well as review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each study site participating in the clinical trial or a central IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, informed consent forms, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. 

Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. 

Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, enrollment of potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 

The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. 

In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 

&#8226; Phase 1 &#8212;Studies are initially conducted in healthy human volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition and test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure &#8209;activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. If possible, Phase 1 trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 

&#8226; Phase 2 &#8212;Controlled studies are conducted in limited subject populations with a specified disease or condition to evaluate preliminary efficacy, identify optimal dosages, dosage tolerance and schedule, possible adverse effects and safety risks, and expanded evidence of safety. 

&#8226; Phase 3&#8212; These adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials are undertaken in expanded subject populations, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the 

&#160;

overall risk &#8209;benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. 

The FDA may also require, or companies may conduct, additional clinical trials for the same indication after a product is approved. These so &#8209;called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 

In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above &#8209;described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. 

Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s or the IRB&#8217;s requirements, if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to the subjects, or based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

During the development of a new drug, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim as well as preclinical carcinogenicity trials and stability studies. An SPA may only be modified with the agreement of the FDA and the trial sponsor or if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. An SPA is intended to provide assurance that, in the case of clinical trials, if the agreed &#8209;upon clinical trial protocol is followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk &#8209;benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, SPAs are not binding on the FDA if, among other reasons, previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, other new scientific concerns regarding the product candidate&#8217;s safety or efficacy arise, or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocol. 

NDA Submission, Review by the FDA, and Marketing Approval 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture, and controls, non &#8209;clinical studies, and clinical trial results, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are all submitted to the FDA, along with the proposed labeling, as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs, which are 

&#160;

further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. 

Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth substantive review of the NDA. 

Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within ten months from the 60 &#8209;day filing date for its initial review of a standard NDA for a New Molecular Entity, or NME. For non &#8209;NME standard applications, the FDA has set the goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within ten months from the submission date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission. 

The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs to advisory committees when it is determined that an advisory committee&#8217;s expertise would be beneficial to the regulatory decision &#8209;making process, including the evaluation of novel products and the use of new technology. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, safety, potency, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre &#8209;Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data. 

&#160;

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post &#8209;approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. 

After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. The FDA may also withdraw the product approval if compliance with the pre &#8209; and post &#8209;marketing regulatory standards are not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling, or FDA notification may be required. 

505(b)(2) Approval Process 

Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The applicant may rely upon the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug or on published scientific literature, in support of its application. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the changes from the reference listed drug as well as bridging studies to the reference listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Orange Book Listing 

Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be pre &#8209;approved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed &#8220;abbreviated&#8221; because they are generally not required to include preclinical and 

&#160;

clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject&#8217;s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations , also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 

Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent has expired and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from making the approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30 &#8209;month stay. 

In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30 &#8209;month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor&#8217;s decision to initiate patent litigation. 

Exclusivity 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval effective date of certain applications. The FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug. Five years of exclusivity are available to New Chemical Entities, or NCEs. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review and make an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for an application submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a paragraph IV certification is filed. 

&#160;

If a product is not eligible for NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three &#8209;year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation or indication for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three &#8209;year exclusivity period protects against FDA making an approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug&#8217;s approval effective. As a general matter, the three year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five &#8209;year and three &#8209;year exclusivity will also not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well &#8209;controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Moreover, even if a product receives a period of exclusivity, a physician may prescribe the reference listed drug or a generic version of the reference listed drug off &#8209;label for the same use as the newly approved drug. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non &#8209;patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non &#8209;patent exclusivity period described above. This six &#8209;month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the required time frames, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Moreover, pediatric exclusivity attaches to all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for products with existing marketing exclusivity or patent life that contain the same active moiety as that which was studied. 

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. If granted, prior to product approval, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user &#8209;fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 

Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 

The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of certain drug products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 

To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If Fast Track designation is obtained, drug sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an 

&#160;

NDA before the application is complete. This &#8220;rolling review&#8221; is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a Fast Track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review. 

The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines, of the 60 &#8209;day filing date for NMEs and within six months of the submission date for non &#8209;NMEs. Products that are eligible for Fast Track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 

Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life &#8209;threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for the Fast Track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross &#8209;disciplinary review. 

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 

Post &#8209;approval Requirements 

Any product manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, drug shortage reporting, and periodic reporting; product sampling and distribution; advertising; marketing; promotion; certain electronic records and signatures; and post &#8209;approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 

After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and list their drug products, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon the company and third &#8209;party manufacturers. 

Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third &#8209;party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Pharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce 

&#160;

the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off &#8209;label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off &#8209;label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label drug product with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers&#8217; products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences of death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post &#8209;market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment, and may result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences. 

Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 

Our business activities, including but not limited to research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities following product approval, will be subject to regulation by numerous federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and state and local governments. Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, anti &#8209;kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations, which are described below. 

The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, furnishing, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. There are certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are 

&#160;

drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case &#8209;by &#8209;case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, of 2010, as amended, modified the intent requirement under the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The ACA further created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. 

The federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off &#8209;label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug&#8217;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have further been sued under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Liability may be predicated on reckless disregard for the truth. Civil False Claims Act actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. In recent years, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, as much as $3.0 billion, regarding certain sales practices and promoting off label drug uses. Civil False Claims act liability may be imposed for Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, for example, overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts, that are not refunded within 60 days of identifying the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act. 

The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 

The civil monetary penalties statute is another potential statute under which biopharmaceutical companies may be subject to enforcement. Among other things, the civil monetary penalties statue imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Payment or reimbursement of prescription drugs by Medicaid or Medicare requires manufacturers of the drugs to submit pricing information to CMS. The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires manufacturers to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for the drug. Drugs that are approved under a Biologic License Application, or BLA, or an NDA, including 505(b)(2) drugs, are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. In addition, for BLA and NDA drugs, the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, requires manufacturers to calculate and report to the Veterans Administration, or VA, a different price called the Non &#8209;Federal 

&#160;

Average Manufacturing Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires manufacturers to provide this discount on drugs dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program. All of these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, and potential FCA liability. 

The VHCA also requires manufacturers of covered drugs participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered drugs must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP and to report pricing information. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires manufacturers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation. The ACA further created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. 

Further, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its respective implementing regulations imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity&#8217;s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws may govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third &#8209;party payor, including commercial insurers. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers&#8217; use of prescriber &#8209;identifiable data. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; or require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject penalties or other enforcement actions, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare 

&#160;

programs, corporate integrity agreements, debarment from receiving government contracts or refusal of new orders under existing contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Enforcement actions can be brought by federal or state governments, or as qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government under the civil False Claims Act if the violations are alleged to have caused the government to pay a false or fraudulent claim. 

To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post &#8209;marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti &#8209;fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Coverage and Reimbursement Generally 

The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third &#8209;party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by CMS through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state &#8209;defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program, including supplemental rebate programs that restrict coverage to drugs on the state Preferred Drug List. Similarly, government laws and regulations establish the parameters for coverage of prescription drugs by Tricare, the health care program for military personnel, retirees, and related beneficiaries. Many states have also created pharmacy assistance programs for individuals who do not qualify for federal programs. In the United States, private health insurers and other third &#8209;party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. 

In the United States, the European Union, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third &#8209;party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third &#8209;party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third &#8209;party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA &#8209;approved drug products for a particular indication. Third &#8209;party payors also control costs by requiring prior authorization or imposing other dispensing restrictions before covering certain products, by broadening therapeutic classes to increase competition, and by covering lower cost products for medically accepted off-label use. Third &#8209;party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost &#8209;effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Absent clinical differentiators, third &#8209;party payors may treat products as therapeutically equivalent and base formulary decisions on net cost. To lower the prescription cost, manufacturers frequently rebate a portion of the prescription price to the third &#8209;party payors. 

Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. In addition, government programs like Medicaid include substantial penalties for increasing commercial prices over the rate of inflation which can affect realization and return on investment. 

&#160;

Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. In addition, many government programs as a condition of participation mandate fixed discounts or rebates from manufacturers regardless of formulary position or utilization, and then rely on competition in the market to attain further price reductions, which can greatly reduce realization on the sale. 

Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement, and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid, and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies, and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third &#8209;party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third &#8209;party payors. 

As a result of the above, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost &#8209;effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost &#8209;effective, or the rebate percentages required to secure coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost. 

Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third &#8209;party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third &#8209;party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 

Healthcare Reform Measures 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third &#8209;party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost &#8209;effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160;

Moreover, as enacted, the ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health care industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. The law expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing both the volume of sales and manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability. The law also expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B drug discount program, which mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers, and other qualifying providers, although, with the exception of children&#8217;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. The law additionally extended manufacturer&#8217;s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to patients enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products, which is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. The revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula could have the further effect of increasing the required 340B discounts. Further, the ACA requires manufacturers of NDA drugs, including 505(b)(2) drugs, to pay 50% of the pharmacy charge to Medicare patients while they are in the coverage gap. Finally, the ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted through the ACA and otherwise, including the reporting of drug sample distribution, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. On February 1, 2016 , CMS published a final rule governing manufacturers&#8217; obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including the calculation and reporting of AMP and Best Price and the payment of rebates. Among other changes, the final rule extends the Program to the territories of the United States, which will increase manufacturers&#8217; overall rebate liability and creates the risk that a low price in the territories could increase the unit rebate amount applied to all Medicaid utilization of the drug. On March 8, 2016 , CMS announced a proposed rule to test new models for Medicare Part B payment for prescription drugs intended to eliminate incentives for providers to purchase higher cost therapeutically equivalent drugs and in some cases create incentives to select lower cost alternatives. In the coming years, similar and additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product candidates. 

The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third &#8209;party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms. 

Some third &#8209;party payors also require pre &#8209;approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost &#8209;containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably. 

In addition, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, federal budget &#8220;sequestration&#8221; Medicare payment reductions became effective on April 1, 2013 and automatically reduced payments under various government programs, including, for example, certain Medicare provider and supplier reimbursement payments.In November 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act was enacted into law, which, among other things, extended sequestration through 2025. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved. 

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 

Foreign Regulation 

To the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As in the United States, post &#8209;approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 

European Union Drug Approval Process 

To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under the so &#8209;called centralized, decentralized, mutual recognition, or national authorization procedures. 

Centralized Procedure 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding clock stops. 

Other Authorization Procedures 

There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#8226; Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply in more than one European Union country, although the applicant must nominate one reference European Union Member State, for simultaneous authorization of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Failing agreement, there is a procedure for resolving disagreements between member states and ultimately an arbitration procedure before the CHMP. 

&#8226; Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, referred to as the reference member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other nominated European Union countries, referred to as the concerned member states, in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. The procedure for disagreements described above similarly applies. 

&#8226; National procedures. Purely national procedures continue to be possible but are strictly limited to where the product is to be authorized in one member state only. 

In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing, referred to as reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the European Union until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union. The 10 &#8209;year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 

Research and Development 

Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $ 6.8 million, $4.3 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to complete the development of AXS-02, AXS-05, and AXS-06. 

Employees 

As of March 22, 2016, we had 11 full &#8209;time employees and 4 key consultants, 3 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
