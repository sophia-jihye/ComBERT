 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

(a) General Development of Business 

&#160; 

Liberty Interactive Corporation, formerly known as Liberty Media Corporation, ("Liberty", the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies which are primarily engaged in the video and on-line commerce industries. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we operate in North America, Europe and Asia. Our principal businesses and assets include our significant consolidated subsidiaries QVC, Inc. ("QVC"), zulily, llc (&#8220;zulily&#8221;), Bodybuilding.com, LLC ("Bodybuilding"), CommerceHub and Evite, Inc. (&#8220;Evite&#8221;) and our equity affiliates Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia"), HSN, Inc. ("HSN"), FTD Companies, Inc. (&#8220;FTD&#8221;), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (&#8220;Interval Leisure Group&#8221;) and LendingTree, Inc. (&#8220;LendingTree&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On September 23, 2011, Liberty completed the split-off of a wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Media Corporation ("LMC") (formerly known as Liberty CapStarz, Inc. and prior thereto known as Liberty Splitco, Inc.) (the "LMC Split-Off"). At the time of the LMC Split-Off, LMC owned all the assets, businesses and liabilities previously attributed to the Capital and Starz tracking stock groups. The LMC Split-Off was effected by means of a redemption of all of the Liberty Capital common stock and Liberty Starz common stock of Liberty in exchange for the common stock of LMC. Following the LMC Split-Off, Liberty and LMC operate as separately publicly traded companies and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. 

&#160; 

On August 9, 2012, Liberty completed the approved recapitalization of its common stock through the creation of the Liberty Interactive common stock and Liberty Ventures common stock as tracking stocks. In the recapitalization, each holder of Liberty Interactive Corporation common stock remained a holder of the same amount and series of Liberty Interactive common stock and received 0.05 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Ventures common stock, by means of a dividend, with cash issued in lieu of fractional shares of Liberty Ventures common stock. 

&#160; 

On October 3, 2014, Liberty reattributed from the Interactive Group to the Ventures Group approximately $1 billion in cash and its Digital Commerce companies, including Backcountry .com, Inc. , Bodybuilding, CommerceHub, Provide Commerce, Inc., and Evite . Subsequent to the reattribution, the Interactive Group is now referred to as the QVC Group. The QVC Group has attributed to it L iberty&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries QVC and zulily (as of October 1, 2015) and its approximate 38% interest in HSN, along with cash and certain liabilities. In connection with the reattribution, the Liberty Interactive tracking stock trading symbol &#8220;LINTA&#8221; was changed to "QVCA" and the "LINTB" trading symbol to "QVCB," effective October 7, 2014. Other than the issuance of Liberty Ventures shares in the fourth quarter of 2014, the reattribution of tracking stock groups has no consolidated impact on Liberty. Effective June 4, 2015, the name of the &#8220;Liberty Interactive common stock&#8221; was changed to the &#8220;QVC Group common stock.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or "track" the economic performance of a particular business or "group," rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. Liberty has two tracking stocks, QVC Group common stock and Liberty Ventures common stock, which are intended to track and reflect the economic performance of the QVC Group and Ventures Group, respectively. While the QVC Group and the Ventures Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore no group can own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and are not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation. 

&#160; 

On August 27, 2014, Liberty completed the spin-off to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of its former wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;TripAdvisor Holdings&#8221;) (the &#8220;TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off&#8221;), which was effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of TripAdvisor Holdings to the stockholders of Liberty&#8217;s Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock. TripAdvisor Holdings is comprised of Liberty&#8217;s former 22% economic and 57% voting interest in TripAdvisor, Inc. as well as BuySeasons, Inc., Liberty&#8217;s former wholly-owned subsidiary, and a corporate level net debt balance of $350 million. Concurrently with the margin loans, Liberty and 

I- 3 

&#160;

TripAdvisor Holdings entered into a promissory note whereby TripAdvisor Holdings may request, if the closing price per share of TripAdvisor common stock were to fall below certain minimum values , up to $200 million in funds from Liberty. The TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off has been recorded at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution. Following the completion of the TripAdvisor Holdings Spin-Off, Liberty and TripAdvisor Holdings operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. The consolidated financial statements of Liberty have been prepared to reflect TripAdvisor Holdings as discontinued operations. 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2015, Liberty acquired zulily, inc. (&#8220;zulily&#8221;) (now known as zulily, llc) for consideration of approximately $2.3 billion, comprised of $9.375 of cash and 0.3098 newly issued shares of Series A QVC Group common stock for each zulily share, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched every day. Effective October 1, 2015, zulily is attributed to the QVC Group. 

&#160; 

On November 12, 2015, Liberty announced that its board of directors had authorized management to pursue a plan to spin-off to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of newly formed companies to be called CommerceHub, Inc. and Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;proposed spin-offs&#8221;). CommerceHub, Inc. would be comprised of Liberty&#8217;s Commerce Technologies, Inc. (d/b/a CommerceHub) business. Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. would be comprised of, among other things, Liberty&#8217;s interest in Expedia, Inc. and Liberty&#8217;s subsidiary Bodybuilding.com, LLC. The applicable record dates, distribution dates and distribution ratios for the proposed spin-offs will be announced at a later date. Each of the proposed spin-offs is intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty Ventures and will be subject to various conditions including the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel. Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions, the completion of each of the proposed spin-offs is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2016.

QVC, Inc. 

&#160; 

QVC , a wholly-owned subsidiary, markets and sells a wide variety of consumer products primarily through live merchandise-focused televised shopping programs distributed to approximately 358 million worldwide households each day (including the joint venture in China as discussed below in further detail) and via its websites , including QVC.com, and other interactive media, such as mobile applications . The name, QVC, stands for "Quality, Value and Convenience," which is what QVC strives to deliver to its customers. QVC&#8217;s operating strategy is to create a premier multimedia lifestyle brand and shopping destination for its customers, further penetrate its core customer base, generate new customers, enhance programming distribution offerings and expand internationally to drive revenue and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 92% of its worldwide shipped sales were from repeat and reactivated customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from QVC during the prior twelve months and customers who previously made a purchase from QVC but not during the prior twelve months ). In the same period, QVC attracted approximately 3.3 million new customers. QVC&#8217;s global e-commerce operation comprised $3.9 billion, or 44 %, of its consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

QVC markets its products in an engaging, entertaining format primarily through merchandise-focused live television programs and interactive features on its websites and other interactive media . In the U.S., QVC distributes its programming live 24 hours per day, 364 days per year and presents on average 773 products every week. Internationally, QVC distributes live programming 8 to 24 hours per day, depending on t he market. QVC classifies its product s into six groups: home, beauty, apparel, jewelry, accessories and electronics, which, in 2015 , accounted for 33%, 17 %, 17 %, 10 %, 13% and 10 % , respectively, of its consolidated shipped sales. For the year ended December 31, 201 4 , such percentages were 32%, 17%, 16%, 12%, 12% and 11%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , such percentages were 31%, 17%, 16%, 12%, 12% and 12% , respectively. Many of QVC's brands are exclusive, while others are created by well-known designers. It is QVC's product sourcing team's mission to research and locate compelling and differentiated products from manufacturers who have sufficient scale to meet anticipated demand. QVC offers many QVC-exclusive products, as well as popular brand name and lesser known products available from other retailers. Many of its products are endorsed by celebrities, designers and other well-known personalities who often join its presenters to personally promote their products and provide lead-in publicity on their own television shows. QVC believes that its ability to demonstrate product features and present &#8220;faces and places&#8221; differentiates and defines the QVC shopping experience. QVC closely monitors customer demand and its product mix to remain well-positioned and relevant in popular and growing retail segments, which QVC believes is a significant competitive advantage relative t o competitors who operate brick -and-mortar stores. 

&#160; 

QVC does not depend on any single supplier or designer for a significant portion of its inventory purchases. 

&#160; 

Since its inception, QVC has shipped over 1.85 billion packages in t he U.S. alone. QVC operates eight distribution centers and eight call centers worldwide and is able to ship approximately 91 % of its orders within two days of order

&#160;

placement. Globally, QVC is able to ship approximately 93% of its orders within two days of the order placement. In 2015 , QVC's work force of approximately 17,6 00 emp loyees handled approximately 190 million customer calls, shipped approximately 179 million units globally and served approximately 13 million customers. QVC believes its long-term relationships with major U.S. television distributors, including cable operators (e.g., Comcast and Cox), satellite television providers (e.g., DISH Network and DIRECTV) and telecommunications companies (e.g., Verizon ) , provide it with broad distribution, favorable channel positioning and significant competitive advantages. QVC believes that its significant market share, brand awareness, outstanding customer service, repeat customer base, international reach and scalable infrastructure distinguishes QVC from its competitors. 

&#160; 

QVC-U.S.'s live televised shopping programs are distributed nationally, 24 hours per day, 364 days per year, to approximately 107 million television households. QVC distributes its programming to approximately 98% of television households subscribing to services offered by television distributors. QVC-U.S. programming is also available on QVC.com, its domestic website, and mobile applications via streaming video. QVC-U.S., including QVC.com, contributed $6.3 billion, or 71.6 %, of consolidated net revenue and $1.5 billion of Adjusted OIBDA (defined in Part II, Item 7 of this report ) for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

In March 2013, QVC-U.S. launched over-the-air broadcasting in designated U.S. markets that can be accessed by any television household with a digital antennae in such markets, regardless of whether it subscribes to a paid television service. This allows QVC-U.S. to reach new customers who previously did not have access to the program through other television platforms. 

In August 2013, QVC-U.S. launched an additional channel, QVC Plus, which is being distributed through cable and satellite systems. The channel allows viewers to have access to a broader range of QVC programming options as well as more relevant programming for viewers in differing time zones. 

QVC.com, launched in 1996, complements QVC-U.S.'s televised shopping programs by allowing consumers to purchase a wide assortment of goods offered on its televised programs, as well as other products that are available only on QVC.com. QVC views e-commerce as a natural extension of its business, allowing it to stream live video and offer on-demand video segments of items recently presented live on its televised programs. QVC.com allows shoppers to browse, research, compare and perform targeted searches for products, control the order &#8209; entry process and conveniently access their QVC account. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , QVC.com generated net revenue of $3.1 billion, or 48.9 % of its total domestic net revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 72.5 % of new U.S. customers made their first purchase through QVC.com. 

QVC's televised shopping programs reached approximately 137 million television households outside of the U.S., primarily in Germany , Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Italy and France . In addition, QVC's joint venture in China reached approximately 114 &#160; million homes. Internationally, b eyond the main live programming QVC channels, QVC-International also broadcast s pre-recorded shows on additional channels that offer viewers access to a broader range of QVC programming options. These channels include QVC Beauty &#38; Style and QVC Plus in Germany and QVC Beauty, QVC Extra , QVC Style and QVC +1 in the U.K. The programming created for most of these markets is also available via streaming video on its international websites and mobile applications . QVC's international business employ s product sourcing teams who select products tailored to the interests of each local market. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , QVC's international operations generated $2. 5 billion of consolidated net revenue and $427 million of Adjusted OIBDA (defined in Part II, Item 7 of this report), and QVC's international websites generated $791 million, or 31.8 %, of its total international net revenue. 

On July 4, 2012, QVC entered into a joint venture with Beijing &#8209; based CNR Media Group, formerly known as China Broadcasting Corporation, a limited liability company owned by China National Radio (&#8220;CNR&#8221;), China's government &#8209; owned radio division. The joint venture, CNR Home Shopping Co., Ltd. (&#8220;CNRS&#8221;), is owned 49% by QVC and 51% by CNR through subsidiaries of each company. CNRS operates a retailing business in China through a shopping television channel with an associated website. This joint venture combines CNRS's existing knowledge of the digital shopping market and consumers in China with QVC's global experience and know-how in multimedia retailing. CNRS distributes live programming for 17 hours each day and recorded programming for seven hours each day. The CNRS joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment.

&#160;

In June 2015, QVC expanded its global presence into France, launching its website on June 23, 2015 followed by the launch of television programming on August 1, 2015. &#160; 

QVC distributes its television programs, via satellite and optical fiber, to cable television and direct-to-home satellite system operators for retransmission to their subscribers in the U.S., Germany, Japan, the U.K. , France and neighboring countries. QVC also transmits its television programs over digital terrestrial broadcast television to viewers throughout Italy, the U.K. and to viewers in certain geographic regions in the U.S and Germany. In the U.S., QVC uplinks its analog and digital programming transmissions using a third-party service. Both transmissions are uplinked to protected, non-preemptible transponders on U.S. satellites. "Protected" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, the signal will be transferred to a spare transponder or, if none is available, to a preemptible transponder located on the same satellite or, in certain cases, to a transponder on another satellite owned by the same service provider if one is available at the time of the failure. "Non-preemptible" status means that, in the event of a transponder failure, QVC's transponders cannot be preempted in favor of a user of a failed transponder, even another user with "protected status." The international business units each obtain uplinking services from third parties and transmit their programming to non-preemptible transponders on international satellites. The transponder service agreements for the U.S. transponders expire at the earlier of the end of the lives of the satellites or the service agreements. The service agreements in the U.S. expire between 2 019 and 2023 . The transponder service agreements for the internati onal transponders expire between 2019 and 2024. 

QVC continually seeks to expand and enhance its television and e-commerce platforms, as well as to further its international operations and multimedia capabilities. QVC launched QVCHD in the U.S. in April 2008, and in May 2009, became the first U.S. multimedia retailer to offer a native HD service. QVCHD is a high-definition simulcast of QVC's U.S. telecast utilizing the full 16x9 screen ratio, while keeping the side panel for additional information. High-definition, or HD, programming allows QVC to utilize a typically wider television screen with crisper and more colorful images to present a larger &#8220;storefront,&#8221; which QVC believes captures the attention of channel &#8220;surfers&#8221; and engages its custo mers. In the U.S., QVCHD reaches approximately 80 million television households, as it continues to develop and launch features to further enrich the television viewing experience. 

QVC enters into long-term affiliation agreements with certain of its television distributors who downlink its programming and distribute the programming to customers. QVC's affiliation agreements with both domestic and international distributors have termination dates ranging from 201 6 to 2022. QVC's ability to continue to sell products to its customers is dependent on its ability to maintain and renew these affiliation agreements in the future. Although QVC is typically successful in obtaining and renewing these agreements, it does not have distribution agreements with some of the distributors that carry its programming. In total, QVC is currently providing programming without affiliation agreements to distributors representing approximately 6% of its U.S. distribution, and short-term, rolling 90 day letters of extension, to distributor s who represent approximately 25 % of its U.S. distribution. Some of its international programming may continue to be carried by distributors after the expiration dates on its affiliation agreements with such distributors have passed. 

&#160; 

In return for carrying QVC's signals, each programming distributor in the U.S. receives an allocated portion, based upon market share, of up to 5% of the net sales of merchandise sold via the television programs and from certain Internet sales to customers located in the programming distributor's service areas. Internationally, programming distributors predominately receive an agree d-upon annual fee, a monthly or yearly fee per subscriber regardless of the net sales, a variable percentage of net sales or some combination of the above arrangements. 

&#160; 

In addition to sales-based commissions or per-subscriber fees, QVC also makes payments to distributors primarily in the U.S. for carriage and to secure positioning within a broadcast area or within the general entertainment area on the distributor's channel line-up. QVC believes that a portion of its sales are attributable to purchases resulting from channel &#8220;surfing&#8221; and that a channel position near broadcast networks and more popular cable networks increases the likelihood of such purchases. As technology evolves, QVC will continue to monitor optimal channel placement and attempt to negotiate agreements with its distributors to maximize the viewership of its television programming. 

&#160; 

QVC enjoys a very loyal customer base, as demonstrated by the fact that for the twelv e months ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 86% of its worldwide shipped sales came from repeat customers (i.e., customers who made a purchase from QVC during the prior twelve months), who spent an average of $1,272 each during this period. An additional 6% of 

I- 8 

&#160;

shipped sales in that period came from reactivated customers (i.e., customers who previously made a purchase from QVC, but not during the prior twelve months). 

QVC experienced solid customer growth in 2015. On a trailing twelve month basis, total consolidated customers (excluding the joint venture in China) increased 3% to nearly 13 million and in the US, customers grew 4% to more than 8 million. QVC believes its core customer base represents an attractive demographic target market. Based on internal customer data, approximately 52 % of its 8 million U.S. customers for the twelv e months ended December 31, 2015 were women between the ages of 35 and 64. 

QVC strives to be prompt and efficient in order taking and fulfillment. QVC has three domestic phone centers located in San Antonio, Texas; Port St. Lucie, Florida (closing in early 2016) ; and Chesapeake, Virginia that can direct calls from one call center to another as volume mandates. Internationally, QVC also has one phone center in each of Japan, the U.K. and Italy , and two call centers in Germany. For France, order taking is handled by a third party located in Portugal. Many markets also utilize home agents to handle calls, allowing staffing flexibility for peak hours. In addition, QVC utilizes computerized voice response units, which handle approximately 26 % of all orders taken on a worldwide basis. 

In addition to taking orders from its customers through phone centers and online, QVC continues to expand its ordering platforms. QVC is expanding mobile device ordering capabilities and over the past severa l years has launched iPhone, iPad , Apple Watch, Android , B lackberry and Apple TV applications, a WAP (wireless application protocol) mobile website and a robust SMS (short message services) program. On a global basis, customers placed approximately 22 % of all orders directly through their mobile devices in 2015 . 

Through QVC's eight worldwide distribution centers, QVC shipped approximately 93 % of its orders within two days of order placement in 2015 . QVC's domestic distribution centers are located in Suffolk, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Rocky Mount, North Carolina; and Florence, South Carolina. Additionally, on July 2, 2015, QVC entered into a lease for a 1 million square foot west coast distribution center in Ontario, California. Construction on this distribution center is expected to be completed in mid-2016. QVC&#8217;s domestic distribution centers and dropship partners have shipped nearly 884,000 units and over 818,000 packages in a single day. QVC also has distribution centers in Sakura-shi, Chiba, Japan, H&#252;cklehoven, Germany, Knowsley, U . K . and Castel San Giovanni, Italy. 

QVC has built a scalable operating infrastructure focused on sustaining efficient, flexible and cost-effective sale and distribution of its products. Since its physical store locations are minimal, QVC requires lower inventory levels and capital expenditure s compared to traditional brick -and-mortar retailers. In recent years, QVC has made significant investments in its distribution centers and information technology systems that it believes will accommodate its foreseeable growth needs. Further, since QVC has no set &#8220;floor plan&#8221; and can closely manage inventory levels at its centralized warehouses, QVC believes it has the flexibility to analyze and react quickly to changing trends and demand by shifting programming time and product mix. QVC's cost structure is highly variable, which QVC believes allows it to consistently achieve attra ctive margins relative to brick -and-mortar retailers. 

QVC's web and mobile platforms are fully integrated with its televised programming and product distribution capabilities. QVC's web and mobile platform features include a live video stream of its television programming, full integra tion with its order fulfillment and its product branding, as well as the thematic offerings and events that have become fundamental to its televised programming. 

Third party carriers transport QVC's packages from its distribution centers to its customers. In each market where QVC operates, it has negotiated long-term contracts with shipping companies, which in certain circumstances provides for favorable shipping rates. 

QVC operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Based on domestic net revenue for the twelv e months ended December 31, 2015 , QVC is the leading television retailer in the U.S. and generates substantially more net revenue than its two closest televised shopping competitors, HSN (an entity in which we have a 38 % ownership interest as of December 31, 2015 ) and EVINE Live . QVC's international operations face similar competition in their respective markets, such as Shop Channel in Japan, HSE 24 in Germany and Italy, Ideal World in the United Kingdom , and M6 Boutique in France . Additionally, QVC has numerous and varied competitors at the national and local levels, ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, wholesale clubs, discount retailers, infomercial retailers, Internet retailers, and mail-order and catalog companies.

&#160; 

QVC also competes for access to customers and audience share with other providers of televised, online and hard copy entertainment and content. The price and availability of other programming and the conversion to digital programming platforms may unfavorably affect the placement of its programming in the channel line-ups of its distributors, and may affect its ability to obtain distribution agreements with small cable distributors. Competition from other programming also affects the compensation that must be paid to distributors for carriage, which continues to increase. Principal competitive factors for QVC include (i) value, quality and selection of merchandise; (ii) customer experience, including customer service and reliability of fulfillment and delivery services and (iii) convenience and accessibility of sales channels. 

&#160; 

QVC regards its trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. QVC relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law, trade &#8209; secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to protect these proprietary rights. QVC has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities and vigorously protects its proprietary rights against infringement. 

&#160; 

Domestically, QVC has registered trademarks and service marks for a variety of items including, but not limi ted to its brand name, "QVC," "Quality Value Convenience," &#8220;Love What You Find, Find What You Love,&#8221; the "Q QVC Ribbon Logo," &#8220;Q&#8221; and its proprietary products sold such as "Arte D'Oro", "Cook's Essentials", "Denim &#38; Co.," "Diamonique", "Nature's Code," "Northern Nights" and "Ultrafine Silver." Similarly, foreign registrations have been obtained for many trademarks and service marks for its brand name and propriety products including, but not limited to, "QVC" the "Q QVC Ribbon Logo," &#8220;Q,&#8221; "Breezies," "Denim &#38; Co.," "Diamonique" and "Northern Nights." QVC considers the service mark for the "QVC" name the most significant trademark or service mark held by it because of its impact on market awareness across all of its geographic markets and on customers' identification with QVC. As with all domestic trademarks or service marks, QVC's trademark and service mark registrations in the United States are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks or service marks are used in the regular course of trade. 

&#160; 

QVC's business is seasonal due to a higher volume of sales in the fourth calendar quarter related to year-end holiday shopping. In recent years, QVC has earned, on average, between 22% and 23% of its global revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year and 32% of its global revenue in the fourth quarter of the year.

On October 1, 2015, we acquired 100% of zulily. zulily is an online retailer offering customers a fun and entertaining shopping experience with a fresh selection of new product styles launched each day. T he zulily website was launched in January 2010 with the goal of revolutioniz ing the way moms shop. Through its desktop and mobile websites and mobile applications, zulily help s its customers discover new and unique products at great values that they would likely not find elsewhere. zulily&#8217;s merchandise includes women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s and men&#8217;s apparel, children&#8217;s merchandise and other products such as kitchen accessories and home d&#233;cor. zulily source s its merchandise from thousands of vendors, including emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors, as well as larger national brands. By bringing together millions of customers and a daily selection of products chosen from its vendor base, zulily has built a large scale and uniquely curated marketplace. 

Every morning, zulily launch es a variety of flash sales events. These events feature thousands of product styles from different vendors and typically last for 72 hours. The day&#8217;s events are kicked off by an early morning email to zulily&#8217;s email subscribers and &#8220;push&#8221; communication to users of zulily&#8217;s mobile applications. Offerings are typically only available for a limited time and in a limited quantity, creating urgency to browse and purchase. The majority of zulily&#8217;s products are sourced from emerging brands and sm aller boutique vendors that its customers may not have heard of and whose products are not widely available online. zulily also offer s larger , nationally known brands that appeal to its customers and draw new customers to its sites. 

I- 10 

&#160;

Before zulily launch es an event, zulily &#160; shoots or obtains photographs of the merchandise and its editorial team writes about the merchandise. The experience, creativity, resourcefulness and efficien cy of zulily&#8217;s merchandising, creativ e and operations teams enable zulily to feature thousands of product styles each quarter. zulily work s to create the most compelling price points for its customers, with the average item offered for approximately 50% off the manufacturer&#8217; s suggested retail price. zulily then use s its proprietary technology, data analytics and pers onalization tools to segment its audience, offering each customer a curated and optimized shopping experience that features br ands, products and events that it believe s are most relevant for that customer. 

zulily acquire s new email subscribers through a diverse set of paid and unpaid marketing channels, including affiliate channels and partners, customer referrals, direct navigation, display advertising, key word search campaigns, search engine optimization, social media and television ads. Core to its business model is that zulily acquire s customers once via paid and unpaid sources, and then drive s engagement and repeat purchases from those customers over a long period of time through the sending of daily emails and mobile &#8220;push&#8221; communications. 

Continual innovation through investm ent in technology is core to zulily&#8217;s business. zulily use s &#160; its technology platform to improve the experience of its customers and vendors, increase the purchase frequency and ave rage order size an d optimize the efficiency of its business operations. zulily&#8217;s technology team is focused on rapid innovation through advanced agile sof tware development processes. zulily&#8217;s scalable platform uses custom-built and third-p arty technologies to support its specific customer and vendor requirements, including handling significant spikes in site traffic and transactions on a daily basis, and the rapid and complex order fulfillm ent needs that are unique to zulily&#8217;s flash sales and minimal inventory model. zulily believe s &#160; it can quickly scale its infrastructure to accommodate significantly higher volumes of site traffic, customers, orders and the ove rall growth in its business. 

To best serve its customers and vendors, zulily has a custom, fully integrated fulfillment infrastructure consisting of receiving, sorting, inventory management and repackaging syst ems which are coordinated by proprietary fulf illment management software. zulily&#8217;s supply chain solution efficiently handles the small-to-medium lot sizes and high in ventory turnover required by constantly changing, li mited-time product offerings. zulily operate s a minimal invent ory, intermediary model where it typically take s customer orders before purchasing inventory from vendors. As a result, zulily is able to offer a much larger selection of products to customers and to generate greater sales for vendors, who are able to match a broader range of their product supply to actual customer demand. 

zulily v iew s its target market broadly and competes with any retailer where its customers shop. It face s significant competition from bo th online and offline retailers, competing on: product curation and selection, personalization, value, convenience, ease of use, consumer experience, vendor satisfaction and shipping time and cost. &#160; &#160; 

zulily relies on laws and regulations, contractual restrictions, copyright s, and trademarks to protect its intellectual prop erty and proprietary rights. zulily&#8217;s employees and contractors also typically enter into agreements to assign to zulily the inventions and content they prod uce in performing their jobs. zulily control s access to confidential information by entering into con fidentiality agreements with its employees, contractors and third parties, such as vendors, service providers, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with zulily . Despite the protection of general intellectual property law and its contractual restrictions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use zulily&#8217;s intellectual property without zulily&#8217;s authorization. 

zulily has registered numerous Inter net domain names related to its business. As of December 31, 2015, it had two pending pat ent applications directed to its technology in th e United States. In addition, zulily pursue s the registration of its trademarks in the United States and certain other locations outside of the United States; however, effective intellectual property protection or enforcement may not be available in every country in which zulily&#8217;s products and services are made available in the future . In the United States and certain other countries, zulily has registered or has application s pending for its key trademarks: zulily, the zulily design mark and the &#8220;Z&#8221; design associated with its mobile applications. 

zulily&#8217;s results are impacted by a pattern of increased sales during the back-to-school shopping season in the third quarter and holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter , which we expect would result in lower sequential growth in the first quarter. The fourth quarter accounted for approximately 31.3% of zulily&#8217;s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Regulatory Matters 

Programming and Interactive Television Services 

Although QVC, a wholly owned subsidiary, and HSN, a business affiliate, market and sell consumer products through a variety of outlets, each does so, in large part, through live video programming services distributed by cable television systems, satellite systems and over-the-air broadcasters. Consequently, regulation of programming services and the entities that distribute them can affect QVC and HSN. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) regulates broadcasters, the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services, the cable television systems and other multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") that distribute such services, and, to some extent, the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing. Cable television systems in the United States are also regulated by municipalities or other state and local government authorities. Regulatory carriage requirements also could adversely affect the number of channels available to QVC and HSN. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Program Licensing. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (the 1992 Cable Act) directed the FCC to promulgate regulations regarding the sale and acquisition of cable programming between MVPDs (including cable operators) and satellite-delivered programming services in which a cable operator has an attributable interest. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing regulations generally prohibit a cable operator that has an attributable interest in a satellite programmer from improperly influencing the terms and conditions of sale to unaffiliated MVPDs. Further, the 1992 Cable Act requires that such affiliated programmers make their programming services available to cable operators and competing MVPDs such as multi-channel multi-point distribution systems and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") distributors on terms and conditions that do not unfairly discriminate among distributors, and the FCC has established complaint enforcement and damages remedy procedures. FCC rules attribute the ownership interest in Charter Communications, Inc. of Liberty Broadband Corporation (&#8220;Liberty Broadband&#8221;), and Liberty Global plc&#8217;s ownership interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico, LLC to us, thereby subjecting us and satellite-delivered programming services in which we have an interest to the program access rules. We are also subject to the program access rules as a condition of FCC approval of LMC&#8217;s transaction with News Corporation in 2008. 

&#160; 

In 2014, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on a proposal to revise the definition of MVPD in its rules to include services, such as Internet-based services, that make available for purchase by viewers, multiple linear streams of video programming, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming. If the FCC were to adopt its proposed definition and determine that the program access rules apply to such MVPDs, QVC and HSN potentially would be required to negotiate with, and license their programming services to, such MVPDs and to comply with other related regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Carriage of Programming. Under the 1992 Cable Act, the FCC has adopted regulations prohibiting cable operators from requiring a financial interest in a programming service as a condition to carriage of such service, coercing exclusive rights in a programming service or favoring affiliated programmers so as to restrain unreasonably the ability of unaffiliated programmers to compete. The FCC has established program carriage complaint rules. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Ownership. The 1992 Cable Act required the FCC, among other things, (1) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that will be allowed to carry programming in which the owner of such cable system has an attributable interest and (2) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which MVPDs (including cable operators) may engage in the creation or production of video programming. Although the FCC adopted regulations limiting carriage by a cable operator of national programming services in which that operator holds an attributable interest in 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (&#8220;D.C. Circuit&#8221;) vacated the FCC's decision and remanded the rule to the FCC for further consideration in 2001. In response to the Court's decision, the FCC issued further notices of proposed rulemaking in 2001 and in 2005 to consider channel occupancy limitations, but has not issued any rules. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Carriage of Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act granted broadcasters a choice of must carry rights or retransmission consent rights. The rules adopted by the FCC generally provided for mandatory carriage by cable systems of all local full-power commercial television broadcast signals selecting must carry rights and, depending on a cable 

I- 15 

&#160;

system's channel capacity, non-commercial television broadcast signals. Such statutorily mandated carriage of broadcast stations coupled with the provisions of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which require cable television systems with 36 or more "activated" channels to reserve a percentage of such channels for commercial use by unaffiliated third parties and permit franchise authorities to require the cable operator to provide channel capacity, equipment and facilities for public, educational and government access channels, could adversely affect QVC and HSN by limiting the carriage of such services in cable systems with limited channel capacity. 

&#160; 

Closed Captioning Regulation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 also required the FCC to establish rules and an implementation schedule to ensure that video programming is fully accessible to the hearing impaired through closed captioning. The rules adopted by the FCC require substantial closed captioning, with only limited exemptions. In 2012, the FCC adopted regulations pursuant to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 ("CVAA") that require, among other things, video programming owners to send caption files for Internet protocol ("IP") delivered video programming to video programming distributors and providers along with program files. A four year implementation period for the IP-delivered programming captioning requirements will be completed in 2016. In February 2014, the FCC adopted closed captioning quality standards regarding captioning accuracy, synchronicity, completeness and placement, and captioning best practices for programmers. These new closed captioning requirements took effect in March 2015. As a result, QVC and HSN may incur additional costs for closed captioning. 

&#160; 

Internet Services 

&#160; 

Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") adopted revised COPPA regulations amending certain definitions and modifying certain operational requirements regarding notice and parental consent, among other matters. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. On February 11, 2016, the Senate approved legislation, which must be signed by the President, that permanently extends the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce. 

&#160; 

Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. To the extent that Bodybuilding.com, for example, markets or sells nutritional or dietary supplements, its activities may be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in certain respects. Dietary supplement distributors must comply with FDA regulations regarding supplement labeling and reporting. 

&#160; 

Our online commerce businesses also are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, on December 15, 2015, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (&#8220;Council&#8221;) reached agreement on new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The European Parliament and the Council are expected to adopt the new laws in early 2016, with the laws expected to become effective on a future date following adoption . Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the &#8220;Safe Harbor Framework,&#8221; which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. European Union and U.S. authorities have announced a new data transfer structure, Privacy Shield, to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, but the details of Privacy Shield have not yet been finalized. The 

I- 16 

&#160;

European Union and the U.S. must implement the new framework, which may be subject to legal challenge. Finally, a European Union directive restricting the Internet tracking tools known as "cookies" has taken effect. In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information is pending in Congress. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the FCC amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses' websites to purchase products and services, such businesses could be harmed. Congress and individual states may consider additional online privacy legislation. 

Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability.

In 2010, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that largely were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in 2014. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted new open Internet rules that reclassify broadband Internet access as a &#8220;telecommunications service&#8221; rather than an &#8220;information service&#8221; under Title II of the Communications Act, as well as Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The rules also prohibit broadband providers from: (1) blocking access to legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; and (3) favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration. Multiple parties have challenged the open Internet rules in the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit is expected to rule on the challenge in 2016.

Proposed Changes in Regulation &#160; 

&#160; 

The regulation of programming services, cable television systems, DBS providers, Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our businesses that engage in video and online commerce compete with traditional brick-and-mortar and online retailers ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, such as mail order and catalog companies, and discount retailers. Due to the nature of these businesses there is not a single or small group of competitors that own a significant portion of the overall market share. However, some of these competitors, such as Amazon, have a significantly greater Web-presence than our e-commerce subsidiaries. In addition, QVC and HSN compete for access to customers and audience share with each other and with other conventional forms of entertainment and content. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which our electronic commerce businesses compete are high-quality products, brand recognition, selection, value, convenience, price, website performance, customer service and accuracy of order shipment. Our businesses that offer services through the Internet compete with businesses

&#160;

that offer their own services directly through the Internet as well as with traditional offline providers of similar services. Expedia also competes with hoteliers and airlines as well as travel planning service providers, including aggregator sites that offer inventory from multiple suppliers, such as airline sites, Travelocity and Priceline, and with American Express and Navigant International, providers of corporate travel services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which our businesses that offer services through the Internet engage are selection, price, availability of inventory, convenience, brand recognition, accessibility, customer service, reliability, website performance, and ease of use.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our corporate function is supported by a services agreement with LMC which has approximately 80 corporate employees who are also considered employees of Liberty. Additionally, our consolidated subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 22,000 full and part-time employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.
