 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a company engaged in the business of developing proprietary technology that enables a quick and safe installation by the use of a weight-bearing power plug for electrical fixtures, such as light fixtures and ceiling fans, into ceiling and wall electrical junction boxes. Our patented technology consists of a fixable socket and a revolving plug for conducting electric power and supporting an electrical appliance attached to a wall or ceiling. The socket is comprised of a non-conductive body that houses conductive rings connectable to an electric power supply through terminals in its side exterior. The plug, also comprised of a non-conductive body that houses corresponding conductive rings, attaches to the socket via a male post and is capable of feeding electric power to an appliance. The plug also includes a second structural element allowing it to revolve with a releasable latching which, when engaged, provides a retention force between the socket and the plug to prevent disengagement. The socket and plug can be detached by releasing the latch, disengaging the electric power from the plug. The socket is designed to replace the support bar incorporated in electric junction boxes, and the plug can be installed in light fixtures, ceiling fans, wall sconce fixtures and other electrical devices. The combined socket and plug technology is referred to throughout this prospectus as &#8220;the SQL Technology&#8221;.

&#160;

Products 

&#160; 

We currently manufacture and sell ceiling fans and lighting fixtures branded with the General Electric logo and manufactured under General Electric&#8217;s guidance. Our ceiling fans and lighting fixtures offer unique designs, and are manufactured with and without the SQL Technology.

&#160;

The SQL Technology is an attachment fitting plug and mounting receptacle used to install lighting fixtures and ceiling fans. The SQL Technology replaces the traditional mounting bar found in existing electrical junction boxes, converting the mounting system into a weight bearing plug with no exposed wires. Our technology could transform the lighting fixture and ceiling fan industry. Using the SQL Technology, anyone can safely install lighting fixtures and ceiling fans in minutes. Professional electricians as well as &#8220;Do it Yourself&#8221; installers will benefit from our technology. The SQL Technology is Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed for USA and Canada and is licensed by GE.

&#160;

Our SQL Technology is comprised of two parts: a &#8216;female&#8217; socket receptacle that is secured to existing electrical junction boxes, into which electrical and ground wires are simply inserted and secured into terminals on the device, and a &#8216;male&#8217; plug fitting that is preinstalled on the lighting fixture or fan. The receptacle is easily attached to the junction box, and any lighting fixture or fan with the SQL Technology can be literally installed in seconds. Our manufacturing plan calls for the SQL Technology to be pre-installed in all types of lighting fixtures, including holiday themed lighting, and ceiling fans.

&#160;

In February 2015, we received an updated United Laboratory (UL) Listing for the SQL Technology. This listing expands the type of products that we will be able to use with the SQL Technology. This listing expanded the voltage and amperage that our product is rated for and will allow for additional fixtures, such as heating elements to be incorporated into our ceiling fans.

&#160;

We have been working with several well established factories producing ceiling fans and lights in Peoples Republic of China. Most, if not all, of these factories have been in business for over 20 years and follow strict human rights and sustainability protocols.

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have developed a proprietary technology, the SQL Technology, that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the lighting and ceiling fan fixture marketplace. We protect the SQL Technology through the use of an intellectual property protection strategy that is focused on patent protection. As of March 25, 2016, we have three issued U.S. patents relating to our quick connect device for electrical fixtures. We also have patents in China (two issued patents) and India (one issued patent and one pending patent application), which protects different aspects of the same SQL Technology as the three issued U.S. patents. The Company sought intellectual property protection of the SQL Technology in China due to its current manufacturing operations and prospective sales in China&#8217;s market, and sought protection in India in anticipation of future growth into India&#8217;s developing market, both with respect to the sales of the SQL Technology and potential operations of the Company. We intend to maintain this intellectual property protection for the SQL Technology.

&#160;

The issued patents are directed to various aspects of our plug and socket combination that comprise the quick connect device. The issued patents provide patent protection for our quick connect device, regardless of the electrical fixture used with the quick connect device. As further innovations are developed, we intend to seek additional patent protection to enhance our competitive advantage.

&#160; 

Corporate History and Information 

&#160; 

Safety Quick Light LLC was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 14, 2004. On November 6, 2012, Safety Quick Light LLC was converted into Safety Quick Lighting &#38; Fans Corp. by our Board of Directors (our &#8220;Board&#8221;) at which time all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were transferred to the surviving company. In January 2014, the Company moved into its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and in November 2014 it relocated to its current headquarters in Alpharetta, Georgia. The Company&#8217;s operations currently consist of a corporate management team operating in the Alpharetta, Georgia offices.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 4400 North Point Parkway, Suite 154, Alpharetta, Georgia, 30022 and our telephone number is (770) 754-4711. Our web address is http://www.safetyquicklight.com.

&#160; 

Our Business Model and Strategy 

&#160; 

Safety Quick Light LLC began marketing the SQL Technology in 2007 for installation in light fixtures and ceiling fans during manufacturing and as a kit for installing the SQL Technology in existing light fixtures and ceiling fans. The Company sold 800,000 units of the SQL Technology OEM (&#8220;Original Equipment Manufacturer&#8221;) to lighting manufacturers and retailers who installed the socket and plug technology into their lighting fixtures for sale at retail stores. The Company also sold, directly to the retailers, 100,000 ceiling fans with the SQL Technology embedded into the product. Our management team determined that it could improve its gross margins if it were to market light fixtures and ceiling fans with and without the SQL Technology already installed on fixtures (our &#8220;Business Model&#8221;), instead of marketing the SQL Technology as an add-on device. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company&#8217;s management took the first of several steps toward implementing our Business Model and discontinued marketing the SQL Technology as an add-on device; however, existing orders were honored through 2010 and 2011, resulting in revenues through 2012.

&#160;

Company management then took the next step in furtherance of our Business Model and sought the endorsement of the SQL Technology from General Electric. During 2010 and 2011, GE tested the SQL Technology and in June 2011, GE and SQL Lighting &#38; Fans, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a trademark licensing agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) under which SQL Lighting &#38; Fans, LLC was licensed to use the GE monogram logo on its devices and certain other trademarks on its ceiling fans and light fixtures through December 31, 2017. The License Agreement requires the Company to pay a percent of revenue generated on our products using the GE monogram logo as a license fee, including a minimum license fee payment during the term. The License Agreement enables the Company to market ceiling fans and light fixtures with and without the SQL Technology using the GE logo. The License Agreement imposes certain manufacturing and quality control conditions that we must maintain. In addition to marketing ceiling fans and light fixtures under the GE logo and trademarks, the Company has the right to offer private label ceiling fans and light fixtures with its technology installed to retailers that market private label products. We amended the License Agreement in April 2013, and again in August 2014, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay a minimum total of $12,000,000 in licensing fees, which will be due in December 2018.

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; 

In furtherance of our Business Model, the Company sought to establish trade distribution channels with key retailers. In July 2012, the Company entered into a sales and marketing agreement with Design Solutions International, Inc., a privately held, lighting industry design and marketing firm (the &#8220;DSI Agreement&#8221;). In 2015, DSI was acquired by NBG Home, a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer of home d&#233;cor products owned by Kohlberg &#38; Company. Under the terms of the DSI Agreement, which remains in effect, DSI serves as the Company&#8217;s exclusive sales representative for all its products and goods in the United States and Canada. For its services, DSI receives a commission based on net sales. In addition to DSI&#8217;s sales and marketing support, the Company&#8217;s products will also be sold through GE&#8217;s lighting sales group as a condition of the License Agreement.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s Business Model entails the use of third party manufactures to produce the SQL Technology and the ceiling fans and light fixtures in which SQL Technology is imbedded. The manufacturers currently used by the Company are located in Guangdong province of China and, as required by the Licensing Agreement with GE, must be approved by GE to ensure quality standards are met. To further ensure that quality specifications are maintained, the Company maintains an office in the Guangdong province staffed with GE trained auditors who will regularly inspect its products produced by the third party manufacturer.

&#160;

The Company obtained capital resources necessary to implement its Business Model pursuant to an offering (the &#8220;Notes Offering&#8221;) of our Secured Convertible Promissory Notes, convertible into shares of our common stock at $0.25 per share (each a &#8220;Note&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), and five (5) year common stock warrants to purchase our common stock at $0.375 per share (each a &#8220;Warrant&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;). On November 26, 2013, May 8, 2014 and June 25, 2014 we concluded closings of the Notes Offering with certain &#8220;accredited investors&#8221;, as defined under Regulation D, Rule 501 of the Securities Act.

&#160;

In June, August, November, December 2015 and February 2016, the Company obtained additional capital resources necessary to implement our Business Model through the Stock Offerings. See &#8220;Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities&#8221; in Part II Item 5 of this report.

&#160;

During 2014, the Company experienced unanticipated delays in the facility approval process noted above, which delayed sample availability and thus, sales activity. The Company has since obtained the necessary qualification and approval of the third party manufacturer&#8217;s facilities. The Company also enhanced its Business Model to include an additional, parallel revenue path providing for the design and manufacture of a smaller, less customized, and more unique product line which incorporates the GE branding and the SQL Technology.

&#160;

During 2015, the Company continued to develop its Business Model, following the initial development of its first two channels of business which involved selling its products to big box retailers as well as launching its on-line product sales. The Company is working to develop additional vertical channels and has expanded its marketing and selling efforts to a broader base of customers within each market channel.

&#160;

Industry Overview and Competition 

&#160; 

We currently face competition from traditional lighting technologies. There are numerous traditional light manufacturing companies, worldwide, many of which are significantly larger than us. Traditional lighting technologies have the advantage of a long history of market acceptance and developed relationships with retailers and distributors. We will actively seek to educate our target markets as to the advantages of our technology compared to traditional installation methods and believe the achievement of this objective is critical to our future. Although our technology is proprietary and patent protected, there can be no assurance that a large conventional lighting company will not invent a competing technology that offers similar installation efficiencies and enter the market and utilize its resources to capture significant market share and adversely affect our operating results.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe our products with the SQL Technology can effectively compete against traditional lighting in the areas of installation, maintenance and safety. The SQL Technology offers the advantage of ease of installation and replacement. This feature is superior to other lighting systems, which can require the service of professional electricians to install and remove. Once SQL&#8217;s socket is correctly installed in a ceiling or wall electrical junction box, there is no exposure to live electrical wires resulting in an additional advantage in the area of safety. Furthermore, the installation of our socket, which weighs approximately four (4) ounces, requires significantly less work and exertion compared to traditional ceiling light or fan fixtures, which ordinarily weigh in excess of ten (10) pounds and can weigh hundreds of pounds. There can be no assurance, however, that the current competitors directly involved in this industry or a new competitor will not develop processes or technology which will allow them to decrease their costs, and consequently, erode our price advantage.

&#160;

There is significant competition in the ceiling lighting and fan market place; however, we believe we have a competitive advantage due to the strength of the SQL Technology. This competitive advantage extends to customers both in the residential as well as the commercial markets. The SQL Technology is patented or trademarked in the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, China, and Australia. The Company faces competitive forces from traditional approaches towards ceiling lighting and fans installations. While it is unclear whether SQL&#8217;s unique technology will gain significant market penetration, the Company believes that its safety and installation efficiency features will gain market acceptance since it significantly reduces the time necessary to install such fixtures and, after a one-time installation of the socket component, eliminates further exposure to electrical wires when used in conjunction with fixtures in which the plug is installed.

&#160;

To further bolster the Company&#8217;s competitive position, the Company has engaged the support of DSI, a lighting design and marketing firm whose existing customer base includes Walmart, Costco, The Home Depot, BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Club, Sam&#8217;s Club and other major retailers throughout North America. DSI&#8217;s management boasts an average of 25-years&#8217; experience in the lighting industry with leading manufacturers such as Catalina Lighting, Zellers, Dana Lighting and Lite Factory among others. DSI will provide sales and marketing support in North America and sourcing and production management support in China. In addition to DSI&#8217;s sales and marketing support, the Company&#8217;s products will also be sold through GE&#8217;s lighting sales group as a condition of it License Agreement. The Company believes the combination of DSI and GE sales support will enable it to effectively compete in the ceiling lighting and fan market.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We market our product to retailers and other customers who purchase large quantities of ceiling fans and lighting fixtures. This includes large &#8220;big box&#8221; retailers, such as Walmart, Costco, The Home Depot, Sam&#8217;s Club and BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Club. Our target customers initially place small orders of new products to determine the potential consumer demand. When our target customers are able to gauge consumer demand and, if it is assessed that consumer demand warrants larger orders, our target customers are expected to purchase additional products to accommodate anticipated consumer demand.

&#160;

We also market our products to commercial property and institutional property managers and developers. We believe that this market will benefit from the time saved in installing fixtures and the safety features achieved from the elimination of exposed electrical wires once the SQL Technology socket is installed in the junction box.

&#160;

During 2015, the Company established revenue in its inaugural sales year through sales to three big box retailers, each representing in excess of 10% of our sales in the fiscal year. The Company did not generate revenue during the years 2014 and 2013.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 25, 2016, we had five full time employees in the United States of America and five full time employees in the Peoples Republic of China. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160;

In addition to these salaried employees, the Company&#8217;s non-executive Chairman of our Board, Rani Kohen, serves as a paid consultant to the Company on operational activities. Mr. Kohen is the founder of Safety Quick Lighting &#38; Fans Corp. and previously served as our Chief Executive Officer.

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Retailers purchase ceiling fans for early spring and summer sales. As a result, the Company sells more of this product in the October through February time period. The Company has begun to market lighting fixtures that will reduce the impact of seasonal influences to its sales growth, as lighting products do not lend themselves to seasonal purchases. During periods of economic expansion or contraction our sales by quarter may vary significantly from this seasonal pattern.

&#160;

Overview of Recent Developments 

&#160; 

On February 19, 2016, the Company completed a second closing of the November Stock Offering representing aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $300,000. See &#8220;Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities&#8221; in Part II Item 5 of this report.

&#160;

Government and Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such fluorescent lighting, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products.

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies.

&#160;

Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.

&#160;

We could remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues are $1 billion, as adjusted, or more, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
