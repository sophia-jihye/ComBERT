&#160; 

RealBiz Media Group, Inc., including all its subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as &#8220;RealBiz,&#8221; &#8220;RBIZ&#8221;, &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the business of providing digital media and marketing services for the real estate industry. We currently generate revenue from service fees (video creation and production and website hosting (ReachFactor)) and product sales (Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 and Microvideo app). We were formed through the merging of three divisions: (i) our fully licensed real estate division (formerly known as Webdigs); (ii) our TV media contracts (Home Preview Channel /Extraordinary Vacation Homes) division; and (iii) our Real Estate Virtual Tour and Media group (Realbiz 360). The assets of these divisions were used to create a new suite of real estate products and services that create stickiness through the utilization of video, social media and loyalty programs. At the core of our programs is our proprietary video creation technology which allows for an automated conversion of data (text and pictures of home listings) to a video with voice and music. We provide video search, storage and marketing capabilities on multiple platform dynamics for web, mobile, and TV. Once a home, personal or community video is created using our proprietary technology, it can be published to social media, email or distributed to multiple real estate websites, broadband or television for consumer viewing. 

&#160; 

Products and Services : 

&#160; 

We currently offer the following products and services: 

&#160; 

Enterprise Video Production : We service some of the largest and well known franchisor accounts in the North America Real Estate Market in compiling listings into a Video format and distributing to those franchisor&#8217;s websites, brokers and agents and lead generation platforms 24/7. Some of these multiyear contracts produced over 10 million video listings from 2012-2014 and will be eclipsing that production in 2016. This core area significantly contributes to our growth not only in this core service but continues to allow us access to national databases and directly agents and brokers to allow us access to upgrades and upsell other core products and services. We currently have the ability to produce over 15,000 videos per day and have exclusive agreements with key players such as Century21 Scheetz and ERA systems. 

&#160; 

Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 (formerly PowerAgent): Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 is a newly developed comprehensive marketing toolset for the professional real estate agent which utilizes our proprietary video technology to allow any agent to create videos for their listings, edit them with music and an introduction and market the videos through multiple sources. This product is powered by an intuitive CRM (contact management) and has been designed to allow agents to extend their marketing reach through social media management, email marketing and web site syndication. In addition, the iOs and Android apps work in conjunction with Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 allowing the agent to take many of the capabilities mobile, right to where the asset is located. Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 has been in beta testing for the past 8-months with over 180 agents introduced to the agent community in January 2016. Early reviews of this product from industry experts have been extremely favorable. We intend to sell this product via a monthly subscription model. 

&#160; 

The Virtual Tour (VT) and Microvideo App (MVA) : These programs were developed and implemented to allow agents to access specific video based product strategies that are designed specifically to increase the SEO rank and traffic credit to real estate franchise systems and/or their brokers. The MVA is a proprietary video widget marketing application designed to deliver video and integrate SEO strategies, traffic generation, e-mail, lead generation with mobile-friendly viewing. This solution gives those franchises and brokers a much needed tool to lower their cost of prospect acquisition. 

&#160; 

ReachFactor : Our social media and marketing platform under the &#8220;ReachFactor&#8221; brand name offers a variety of solutions to agents and brokers such as web design and web hosting, digital ad campaigns, blogging, social media management, reputation management and search engine optimization. 

&#160; 

NestBuilder Website Portal : We provide a consumer real estate portal at www.nestbuilder.com which contains over 1.5 million listings. Unlike other leaders in the space that agents are seeking alternatives to, NestBuilder focuses on building agent&#8217;s brands and delivering high-quality leads. They achieve this by offering fully customizable webpages in NestBuilder Agent that will follow their homebuyer throughout the home search, ultimately turning NestBuilder.com into each agent&#8217;s very own national portal. We provide this website free of charge to consumer and agent. 

&#160; 

Nestbuilder Agent : This agent-only platform allows agents to claim and customize their own web page to be used as a marketing platform. This platform interacts with nestbuilder.com site allowing agents to claim their listings and then create customized listing pages, as well as being able to pull other MLS property listings to create specialized marketing messages. Additionally, the agent can view the effectiveness of their marketing efforts through a dashboard that shows multiple statistics including number of views, time spent, origination and lead generation. This platform is provided free of charge and empowers the real estate agent with content and assets that they can use to pursue prospects and generate leads. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Ezflix Mobile App : The ezflix app is a free mobile/web video editor that pre-integrates with an agent&#8217;s listing data, allowing them to edit all of their listing&#8217;s data, and convert them into video with live video interstitial capabilities, audio recording and music. Ezflix can then share videos to all social media, email, and multiple other real estate portals including NestBuilder (www.nestbuilder.com) thereby giving agents a way to personalize their listing videos with entertaining local relevant content. This application is available in both Web and Mobile, was initially launched in both the Android and iOS versions in January and February 2015. This platform as it evolves will combine our VT (Virtual Tour) and MVA (Microvideo App) platform into one solution and distribute to multiple partners and resellers including Photographer and Videographer service providers&#8217; network. This product integration has been substantially upgraded during 2015 and integrates with our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 product (formerly PowerAgent) released in January 2016. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Key Elements of our growth strategy during fiscal 2016 include; 

&#160; 

Leverage our proprietary video technology . While our proprietary video technology has been developed for the real estate industry, we believe this technology can be applied to other industries as well. In particular, we believe that the used car sale industry could benefit from our automated and seamless development engine. 

&#160; 

Design and develop technology for the real estate industry . We will continue working to develop technologies to increase sales and efficiencies for the real estate professional. 

&#160; 

Increase Sales Force . We intend to increase our sales force marginally in 2016 to facilitate the roll-out of our new Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 product. 

&#160; 

Fiscal 2015 and First Quarter 2016 Developments. 

&#160; 

Launch of Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 (formerly PowerAgent) Product . In January 2016, we launched our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 product. This product integrates multiple channels of real estate marketing, combining video production and social media platforms with a goal of allowing agents to be more successful at closing sales. 

&#160; 

Redemption of Convertible Notes . In December 2015, we consummated our settlement with Himmil Investments Ltd. pursuant to which we redeemed our outstanding 7.5% convertible promissory note issued to Himmil and cancellation of their common stock purchase warrants for $500,000. These convertible notes contained a variable conversion price which, in management&#8217;s opinion contributed to downward pressure on our stock price. The funds for the redemption of these notes resulted from the sale of our common stock and warrants which resulted in gross proceeds of $680,000. The balance of the proceeds (after redemption of the Himmil notes and broker fees) was applied to working capital. 

&#160; 

Change of Control . In August 2015, we issued 35,000 shares of our series C preferred stock to our directors Don Monaco (20,000 shares) and Keith White (15,000 shares). Each share of our series C preferred stock is convertible into that number of shares of shares of common stock determined by dividing (i) the stated value ($5.00) by (ii) the conversion price then in effect ($0.05). Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of series C preferred stock are convertible into 3,500,000 shares of common stock. The holders of series C preferred stock vote together with holders of our common stock as a single class and each holder of series C preferred stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to one hundred (100) votes for each share of our common stock into which the series C preferred stock could be converted. Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of series C preferred stock are entitled to 350,000,000 votes. This issuance of series C preferred resulted in a change of control as the series C holders as a class held approximately 68% of the aggregate outstanding voting shares upon issuance (and individually Messrs&#8217; Monaco and White&#8217;s shares of series C preferred stock provides them with approximately 39% and 29% of the aggregate outstanding voting shares, respectively). 

&#160;

Restructuring of management . In August 2015, we completed the restructuring of our management, financial reporting and operations from our former parent company, Monaker Group, Inc. The primary purpose of the restructuring was to eliminate unnecessary development expenses and unlock revenue opportunities by creating a unified technology platform. . In addition, William Kerby was appointed corporate secretary to the board and resigned as CEO and Chairman of the Board. He was replaced by Alex Aliksanyan as CEO and Don Monaco as Chairman of the Board in connection with this process. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Background and Industry Trends 

&#160; 

We believe that the real estate market is undergoing a dramatic change not dissimilar to that previously experienced by traditional stock brokerages. We believe that the most critical aspect driving this change is the advent of the Internet as a tool for searching for and researching real estate, eliminating the commitments of time and expense involved with visiting multiple properties in person. According to the National Association of Realtors&#8217; 2014 &#8220;Member Profile,&#8221; 89% of home buyers use the internet to search for a home, up from 74% in 2010. This mirrors the 69% who use a realtor for their search. Note: many buyers use both the internet and a realtor in their search. In addition, home sellers can use the Internet to check home valuations, track the housing market and research comparable sales information. The majority of consumers used the Internet frequently to search for homes (81%), with consumers aged 33 or younger being higher than average (92%) and 59-67 year olds below (although still high at 69%). Searches are often conducted on mobile devices such as iPhones (47%), iPads (40%) or Androids (24%). One of the most significant trends for our business is that 70% of homebuyers search for and watch video home tours. Also, real estate searches on Google have grown 253% over the past four years. 

&#160; 

The increased use of technology throughout the entire process of a typical residential real estate transaction is an important development in the real estate market. For instance, electronic communication and electronic data storage permits a real estate brokerage to quickly reproduce standard real estate transaction documents, store such documents and store other important information about customers and properties, and communicate quickly with other parties involved in real estate transactions (e.g., title companies, insurers, surveyors, inspectors and governmental agencies), all of which permits increased efficiencies in the process of buying and selling a home. The technological changes and developments generally make it possible to effect a greater volume of transactions with less effort and expense. 

&#160; 

We believe the technological developments in the real estate market and the increased amount of information available to and used by ordinary consumers appear to be circumstances that are similar to those developments that eventually gave rise to the non-traditional stock brokerages which have intruded upon the market dominance of traditional stock brokerages over the past two decades. For example, we note that the non-traditional stock brokerages developed their services and products to compete primarily on the bases of price, consumer effort and technology. Their websites, such as TD Ameritrade or e-Trade, provide not only trading capacity for the average consumer, but also a tremendous amount of information about companies. In this regard, we note that there has recently been a proliferation of various Internet-related real estate businesses that seek to provide either specific and limited services or information relating to residential real estate transactions (e.g., ForSaleByOwner.com, BuyOwner.com, Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com). Like the non-traditional stock brokerages, these businesses typically rely on consumer effort, technology and price as the bases for competition 

&#160; 

However the market models of Zillow/Trulia and Realtor are now in direct conflict with the enterprises that own the listings and that make the actual sales. The Zillow group&#8217;s main revenues are generated by advertising the listing as though another agent owned the listing, an agent that had paid Zillow for such display. Unaware, the consumer thus interacts with the displayed agent thinking they are the one that controls the listing. Then the display agent contacts the true agent and askes to 50/50 split the commission due on the sale. As the consumer power of the Zillow group has grown exponentially, they have substantially cut into the profits of the enterprises and agents that actually own the listings. Thus the battle lines are now drawn between the Zillow group and groups such as Realogy member of companies and Keller Williams. 

&#160; 

We foresee direct and continuous pushback in 2016 by the enterprises against the Zillow group, in trying to neutralize their marketing power and take ownership back of their listings. As publicly owned companies the Zillow group can only grow revenues by increasing advertising rates to the agent community which strikes deep into agent discontent with the enterprises and the resulting demand in action. This competitive model is unique to the real estate industry and clearly will not follow the path of the aforementioned financial portals. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Website and Mobile Applications 

&#160; 

RealBiz is utilizing its proprietary technological Intellectual Property along with its industry contracts to create two separate and very important critical paths for real estate professionals and their organizations to follow. By using its video processing capabilities combined with micro-site and website building techniques RealBiz has created an agent/broker micro-site product that leverages best practices in SEO (search engine optimization) on the agent/brokers behalf and delivers a web and mobile friendly rich media experience to consumers. This solution provides the broker a significant increase in organic ranking in local searches, increased site traffic and by doing so, reduces the agent/broker dependency on traditional listing aggregators. Secondly, by integrating marketing capabilities into a single powerful platform, we have entered the direct to agent sales model through Nestbuilder Agent 2.0, our proprietary marketing toolset. This strategy lowers risk threshold by distributing revenues throughout 1,200,000 registered agents in the US as well as providing a pathway to developing accelerating revenue stream via a monthly subscription model. While the former video generator intensive model for RealBiz will continue to be our primary revenue generator, we believe that our Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 will become the next generation of marketing for the real estate industry. 

&#160; 

Market and Competition 

&#160; 

The National Association of Realtors has approximately 1.2 million members, of which we estimate roughly half are active and associated with at least one real estate brokerage firm. 

&#160; 

Presently, Zillow is the largest independent real estate market site, as measured by homes in its database and unique visitors to its website. In 2015 Zillow completed its acquisition of Trulia making it the single most powerful name in the real estate web marketplace. A full 29% of web property searches were conducted on the joint platforms in 2015. As part of the industry consolidation, NewsCorp recently acquired the 3rd largest real estate portal, Realtor.com. Additionally there are a variety of other websites which have meaningful market share and listing information. We believe a battle for the consumer mindset is now underway as the real estate enterprises enter into a competitive setting against Zillow/Trulia/Realtor/Homes. We also believe RealBiz can benefit from the acrimony as we have positioned ourselves as the friends of the enterprises and offer products and capabilities that will enhance the position of the enterprises by leveraging our technology. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Industry Segments 

&#160; 

We currently operate in one primary operating segment, real estate, mainly through web-assisted services. 

&#160; 

Seasonality of Business 

&#160; 

The residential real estate market has traditionally experienced seasonality, with a peak in the spring and summer seasons and a decrease in activity during the fall and winter seasons. Revenues in each quarter can be significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter, given the time lag between contract execution and closing. A typical real estate transaction has a 30 day lag between contract signing and closing of the transaction. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not subject to environmental regulations that have a material effect upon our capital expenditures or otherwise. 

&#160; 

Other Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to governmental regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities with respect to our operations. We operate several Internet websites that we use to distribute information about and provide our services and content. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the United States relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under the age of 13, including the federal Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to online consumers outside the United States, the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

The Company spends a significant amount of time and resources in developing new software and improving its current products. The Company has spent $835,000 and $575,000, respectively in research and development in each of the fiscal years ending 2014 and 2015. We believe that 2016 will see the benefits of revenue aggregation primarily through the Nestbuilder Agent 2.0 market release. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On October 9, 2012, we completed a share exchange (the &#8220;Exchange Transaction&#8221;) with Monaker Group, Inc. (formerly known as Next 1 Interactive, Inc.), a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Monaker&#8221;), that was contemplated by that certain Share Exchange Agreement entered into on April 4, 2012 (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which we received all of the outstanding equity in Attach&#233; Travel International, Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Monaker (&#8220;Attach&#233;&#8221;) in consideration of our issuance to Monaker of 93 million shares of our newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (our &#8220;Series A Stock). Attach&#233; owned approximately 80% of a corporation named RealBiz Holdings Inc. which is the parent corporation of RealBiz 360, Inc. (&#8220;RealBiz&#8221;). As a condition to the closing of the Exchange Transaction, on October 3, 2012, we changed our name from &#8220;Webdigs, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;RealBiz Media Group, Inc.&#8221;, by engaging in a short-form parent-subsidiary merger in the State of Delaware. 

&#160; 

On October 31, 2014, Monaker Group,Inc.&#8217;s equity interest in the company dropped below 50%. As a result, the Company was de-consolidated from Monaker Group, Inc. for accounting purposes. 

&#160; 

In August 2015, we completed the restructuring of our management, financial reporting and operations from our former parent company, Monaker Group, Inc. The primary purpose of the reconstructuring was to eliminate unnecessary development expenses and unlock revenue opportunities by creating a unified technology platform. 

&#160; 

On August 6, 2015, we issued 35,000 shares of our series C preferred stock to a company controlled by our Chairman, Don Monaco (20,000 shares) and our director, Keith White (15,000 shares). Mr. Monaco received his 20,000 shares in consideration of cancellation of $100,000 in indebtedness owed to him by our former parent company Monaker Group, Inc. which was convertible into 2 million shares of our common stock. Mr. White received his 15,000 shares of series C preferred stock in exchange for his previously held 15,000 shares of our series B preferred stock. Each share of our series C preferred stock is convertible into that number of shares of shares of common stock determined by dividing (i) the stated value ($5.00) by (ii) the conversion price then in effect ($0.05). Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of series C preferred stock are convertible into 3,500,000 shares of common stock. The holders of series C preferred stock vote together with holders of our common stock as a single class and each holder of series C preferred stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to one hundred (100) votes for each share of our common stock into which the series C preferred stock could be converted. Accordingly, the 35,000 shares of series C preferred stock are entitled to 350,000,000 votes. This issuance of series C preferred resulted in a change of control as the series C holders as a class held approximately 68% of the aggregate outstanding voting shares upon issuance (and individually Messrs&#8217; Monaco and White&#8217;s shares of series C preferred stock provides them with approximately 39% and 29% of the aggregate outstanding voting shares, respectively). Prior to the issuance of the series C preferred stock, the holders of our series A preferred stock held approximately 30% of the aggregate voting shares (of which Monaker Group, Inc. held approximately 29.4% of the aggregate outstanding voting shares due to its ownership of the series A preferred stock).
