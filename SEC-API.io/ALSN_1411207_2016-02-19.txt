 ITEM 1. Business 

Overview 

Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147;Allison,&#148; the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;we&#148;) design and manufacture commercial and defense fully-automatic transmissions. The business was founded in 1915 and has been headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana since inception. Allison was an operating unit of General Motors Corporation (&#147;Old GM&#148;) from 1929 until 2007, when Allison once again became a stand-alone company. In March 2012, Allison began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, &#147;ALSN&#148;. 

We have approximately 2,700 employees and 13 different transmission product lines. Although approximately 81% of revenues were generated in North America in 2015, we have a global presence by serving customers in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. We serve customers through an independent network of approximately 1,400 independent distributor and dealer locations worldwide. 

Our Business 

We are the world&#146;s largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles and medium- and heavy-tactical U.S. defense vehicles. Allison transmissions are used in a wide variety of applications, including on-highway trucks (distribution, refuse, construction, fire and emergency), buses (primarily school, transit and hybrid-transit), motorhomes, off-highway vehicles and equipment (primarily energy, mining and construction) and defense vehicles (wheeled and tracked). We estimate that globally, in 2015, we sold approximately 63% of all fully-automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty on-highway commercial vehicle applications. We believe the Allison brand is one of the most recognized in our industry as a result of the performance, reliability and fuel efficiency of our transmissions and is associated with high quality, durability, vocational value, technological leadership and superior customer service. 

We introduced the world&#146;s first fully-automatic transmission for commercial vehicles over 60 years ago. Since that time, we have driven the trend in North America and Western Europe towards increasing automaticity by targeting a diverse range of commercial vehicle vocations. Allison transmissions are optimized for the unique performance requirements of end users, which typically vary by vocation. Our products are highly engineered, requiring advanced manufacturing processes, and employ complex software algorithms for our transmission controls to maximize end user performance. We have developed over 100 different models that are used in more than 2,500 different vehicle configurations and are compatible with more than 500 combinations of engine brands, models and ratings (including diesel, gasoline, natural gas and other alternative fuels). Additionally, we have created thousands of unique Allison-developed calibrations available to be used with our transmission control modules. 

Our Industry 

Commercial vehicles typically employ one of three transmission types: manual, automated manual transmissions (&#147;AMT&#148;) or fully-automatic. Manual transmissions are the most prevalent transmission type used in Class 8 tractors in North America and in medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, generally, outside North America. Manual transmissions utilize a disconnect clutch causing power to be interrupted during each gear shift resulting in energy loss-related inefficiencies and less work being accomplished for a given amount of fuel consumed. In long-distance trucking, this power interruption is not a significant factor, as the manual transmission provides its highest degree of fuel economy during steady-state cruising. However, steady-state cruising is only one part of the duty cycle. When the duty cycle requires a high degree of &#147;start and stop&#148; activity or speed transients, as is common in many vocations as well as in urban environments, we believe manual transmissions result in reduced performance, lower fuel efficiency, lower average speed for a given amount of fuel consumed and inferior ride quality. Moreover, the clutches must be replaced regularly, resulting in increased maintenance expense and vehicle downtime. Manual transmissions also require a skilled driver to operate the disconnect clutch when launching the vehicle and shifting gears. AMTs are manual transmissions that feature automated operation of the disconnect clutch. Fully-automatic transmissions utilize technology that smoothly shifts gears instead of a disconnect clutch, thereby delivering uninterrupted power to the wheels during gear shifts and requiring minimal driver input. These transmissions deliver superior acceleration, higher productivity, increased fuel efficiency, reduced operating costs, less driveline shock and smoother shifting relative to both manual transmissions and AMTs in vocations with a high degree of &#147;start and stop&#148; activity, as well as in urban environments. 

&#160;

Fuel efficiency, reduction in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are important considerations for commercial vehicles everywhere and they tend to go together. We believe fuel efficiency, the measure of work performed for a given amount of fuel consumed, is the best method to assess fuel consumption of commercial vehicles as compared to the more commonly-used fuel economy metric of miles-per-gallon (&#147;MPG&#148;). MPG is inadequate for commercial vehicles because it does not encompass two key elements of efficiency that we believe are important to vehicle owners and operators: payload and transport time. For example, if more work can be completed or more payload hauled using the same amount of fuel and/or over a shorter period of time, then we believe the vehicle is more fuel efficient. Since fuel economy and its MPG metric only accounts for distance traveled and fuel consumed, ignoring time and work performed, it is therefore an inferior metric to fuel efficiency when it comes to assessing commercial vehicles. Markets, regulations, policies and technology continue to evaluate these topics. 

Our Served Markets 

We sell our transmissions globally for use in medium- and heavy-duty on-highway commercial vehicles, off-highway vehicles and equipment and defense vehicles. In addition to the sale of transmissions, we also sell branded replacement parts, support equipment and other products necessary to service the installed base of vehicles utilizing our transmissions. The following table provides a summary of our business by end market, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

North America 

On-Highway. We are the largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for the on-highway medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market in North America. The following is a summary of our on-highway net sales by vehicle class in North America. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our core North American on-highway market includes Class 4-5, Class 6-7 and Class 8 straight trucks, conventional transit, shuttle and coach buses, school buses and motorhomes. Class 8 trucks are subdivided into two markets: straight and tractor. Class 8 straight trucks are those with a unified body (e.g., refuse, construction, and dump trucks), while tractors have a vehicle chassis that is separable from the trailer they pull. We have been supplying transmissions for Class 8 straight trucks for decades, and it is a core end market for us. Today, we have very limited exposure to the Class 8 tractor market because lower priced manual transmissions generally meet the needs of these vehicles which are primarily used in long distance hauling. However, we have identified a portion of the Class 8 tractor market that we call metro tractors that are used in urban environments the majority of the time and developed a fully-automatic transmission (the &#147;TC10&#148;) that meets the unique duty cycle requirements of the Class 8 metro tractor market. Combining the startability and continuous, uninterrupted power qualities of a fully-automatic transmission with the cruising aspects of a manual transmission, the TC10 offers an alternative to traditional manual and automated manual transmissions in tractor applications. 

We sell substantially all of our transmissions in the North American on-highway market to OEMs. These OEMs, in turn, install our transmissions in vehicles in which our transmission is either the exclusive transmission available or is specifically requested by end users who are choosing between a manual transmission, an AMT or a fully-automatic transmission. In 2015, OEM customers representing over 90% of our North American on-highway unit volume participated in long-term supply agreements (&#147;LTSA&#148;) with us. Generally, these supply agreements offer the OEM customer defined levels of mutual commitment with respect to growing Allison&#146;s presence in the OEMs&#146; products and promotional efforts, pricing and sharing of commodity cost risk. The length of our customer agreements is typically between three and five years. We often compete in this market against independent manufacturers of manual transmissions, AMTs, fully-automatic transmissions manufactured by Ford Motor Company (&#147;Ford&#148;), ZF Friedrichshafen AG (&#147;ZF&#148;) and Voith GmbH (&#147;Voith&#148;), and against OEMs in certain weight classes that use their own internally manufactured transmissions in certain vehicles. 

The following table presents a summary of our competitive position by vehicle class in the North America on-highway end market.

Hybrid Transit Buses. The interest in conserving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is driving demand for more fuel efficient commercial vehicles. In North America, we sold approximately 60% of all units for the hybrid transit bus market in 2015. Our customers in this North American end market are typically city, state and federal governmental entities, which utilize government funds to subsidize a portion of the purchase price for the transit buses containing our hybrid-propulsion system. In this market, we compete primarily with BAE Systems plc (&#147;BAE&#148;). 

Off-Highway. We have provided products used in vehicles and equipment that serve energy, mining and construction applications in North America for over 50 years. Off-highway energy applications include hydraulic fracturing equipment, well-stimulation equipment, pumping equipment, and well-servicing rigs, which often use a fully-automatic transmission to propel the vehicle and drive auxiliary equipment. We maintain a leadership position in this end market, with nearly all producers of well-stimulation and well-servicing equipment utilizing our heavy duty off-highway transmissions. Additionally, we sell kits that can increase the horsepower of our existing off-highway products. Competition includes Caterpillar, Inc. (&#147;Caterpillar&#148;) and Twin Disc, Inc. (&#147;Twin Disc&#148;). 

We also provide heavy-duty transmissions used in mining trucks, specialty vehicles and construction vehicles. Mining applications include trucks used to haul various commodities and other products, including rigid dump trucks, underground trucks and long-haul tractor trailer trucks with load capacities between 40 to 110 tons. Our major competitors in this end market are Caterpillar and Komatsu, Ltd. (&#147;Komatsu&#148;), both of which are vertically integrated and manufacture fully-automatic transmissions for their own vehicles. Specialty vehicles using our heavy-duty transmissions include airport rescue and firefighting vehicles and heavy-equipment transporters. Our major competitor in this end market is Twin Disc. Construction applications include articulated dump trucks with Caterpillar, Volvo and ZF as competitors. 

Outside North America 

Outside North America we serve several different markets, including: Europe, Middle East, Africa (&#147;EMEA&#148;), Asia-Pacific, South America and India. 

On-Highway. We are the largest manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for the commercial vehicle market outside of North America. While the use of fully-automatic transmissions in the medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market has been widely accepted in North America, the markets outside North America continue to be dominated by manual transmissions. In 2015, fully-automatic transmission-equipped medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles represented less than 5% of the vehicles in markets outside North America and are concentrated in certain vocational end markets. The following is a summary of our on-highway net sales by region outside of North America. 

&#160;

&#160;

Europe, Middle East, Africa . EMEA is composed of several different markets, each of which differs significantly from our core North American market by the degree of market maturity, sophistication and acceptance of fully-automatic transmission technology. Within Europe, we serve Western European developed markets, as well as Russian and Eastern European emerging markets, principally in the refuse, emergency, bus, coach, distribution and utility markets. Competition in Western Europe is most notably characterized by a high level of vertical powertrain integration with OEMs often utilizing their own manual transmissions and AMTs in their vehicles. The Middle East and Africa regions are generally characterized by very limited local vehicle production, with imports from the U.S., South America, Turkey, China, India and Europe accounting for the majority of vehicles. 

&#160;

Asia-Pacific. Our key Asia-Pacific markets include China, Japan, Australia, and South Korea; however, we actively participate in several other important Asia-Pacific countries including Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which are primarily importers of commercial vehicles. Within Asia-Pacific, our sales efforts are principally focused on the transit bus and vocational truck markets. Currently, manual transmissions are the predominant transmissions used in commercial vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region. 

South America . The South American region is characterized by a high level of OEM integration, with captive manual transmission and AMT manufacturing. Currently, manual transmissions are the predominant transmissions used in commercial vehicles in South America. 

India . Currently, manual transmissions are the predominant transmission used in commercial vehicles in India. 

Off-Highway. The following is a summary of our off-highway net sales by region outside of North America. 

&#160;

&#160;

Europe, Middle East, Africa. Our off-highway markets in EMEA are mining and construction. Our major off-highway competitors are Caterpillar and Komatsu, both of which are vertically integrated manufacturers of off-highway mining vehicles, including the specific fully-automatic transmission used in their mining trucks. A typical construction application is the articulated dump truck, with competition from Caterpillar, Volvo and ZF transmissions. 

Asia-Pacific . Off-highway markets in Asia are shared by energy, mining and construction applications. Our primary competitors are Caterpillar, Danyang Winstar Auto Parts Co. and Twin Disc in energy applications, Caterpillar and Komatsu in mining applications and Caterpillar, Volvo and ZF in construction applications. 

Defense 

We have a long-standing relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense (&#147;DOD&#148;), dating back to 1946, when we began developing our first-generation tank transmission. Today, we sell substantially all of the transmissions for medium- and heavy-tactical wheeled vehicle platforms including the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles, Armored Security Vehicles, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks, Heavy Equipment Transporters, Palletized Loading Systems, M915 Series Trucks, Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacements and the Logistic Vehicle System Replacement. Additionally, we supplied transmissions for the majority of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (&#147;MRAP&#148;) Vehicles and the MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle and for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, which is the replacement vehicle for Humvee personnel transport. Transmissions for our wheeled vehicle platforms are typically sold to OEMs. 

We are also the supplier on two of the three key tracked vehicle platforms, the Abrams tank and the M113 family of vehicles, which are sold directly to the DOD. Additionally, we sell parts kits to licensees for the production of transmissions for tracked vehicles manufactured outside North America. Overall, we have seen the demand for U.S. defense vehicles decrease as the funding for defense vehicles declines. Additionally, the DOD budgets and supplemental spending have allowed them to recapitalize and reset many vehicle systems, which has reduced the average age of the fleet and the need to procure new vehicles. 

Globally, we face competition for the supply of our transmissions in tracked defense vehicles primarily from L-3 Communications Corporation, Renk AG and ZF. Additionally, we face limited competition from Caterpillar in certain defense wheeled vehicle platforms. 

&#160;

Service Parts, Support Equipment and Other 

The aftermarket provides us with a relatively stable source of revenues as the installed base of vehicles and equipment utilizing our transmissions continues to grow. The need for replacement parts is driven by normal vehicle and equipment maintenance requirements and is not significantly impacted by economic cycles. Uninterrupted operation is generally critical for end users&#146; profitability. End users focus on getting the vehicle back in service, which in some cases results in the aftermarket purchase decision being less price-sensitive. 

The sale of Allison-branded parts and fluids, remanufactured transmissions and support equipment is fundamental to our brand promise. We have assembled a worldwide network of approximately 1,400 independent distributor and dealer locations to sell, service and support our transmissions. As part of our brand strategy, our distributors and dealers are required to sell genuine Allison-branded parts. Within the aftermarket, we offer remanufactured transmissions under our ReTran brand, which provides a cost-effective alternative for transmission repairs and replacements. We also provide support equipment to our OEMs to assist in installing new Allison transmissions into vehicles, and, therefore, sales of support equipment are dependent upon sales of new transmissions. 

Over the last few years, traditional aftermarket sales have been tempered by improvements in product quality and durability. While traditional aftermarket sales are expected to grow, support equipment sales fluctuate with the introduction of new transmissions. The competition for service parts and ReTran transmissions comes from a variety of smaller-scale companies sourcing non-genuine &#147;will-fit&#148; parts from unauthorized manufacturers. These &#147;will-fit&#148; parts often do not meet our product specifications, and therefore may be of lesser quality than genuine Allison parts. 

&#160;

Our Product Offerings 

Allison transmissions are sold under the Allison Transmission brand name and remanufactured transmissions are sold under the ReTran brand name. The following is a summary of our 13 transmission product lines.

&#160;

Product Development and Engineering 

We maintain product development and engineering capability dedicated to the design, development, refinement and support of our fully-automatic transmissions and hybrid-propulsion systems. We believe our customers expect our products to provide unparalleled performance and value defined in various ways, including delivering maximum cargo in minimum time, using the least amount of fuel possible while employing the fewest vehicles possible and experiencing maximum vehicle uptime. In response to those needs and the evolving customer focus on fuel efficiency, we provide vehicle specification guidelines, transmission control software and mechanical components to optimize fuel economy while delivering desired vehicle performance. Further, we are developing new technology to improve fuel efficiency and fuel economy by allowing engines to operate more efficiently and at lower speeds to avoid consuming fuel without compromising performance. Building on our engineering capabilities, we pioneered hybrid-propulsion in commercial vehicles and are developing new alternative technologies for use in our global commercial vehicle markets; however, decreased fuel costs, alternative fuels and other technologies have resulted in deteriorating market conditions for hybrid-propulsion vehicles in recent years. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we have invested $92.5 million, $103.8 million and $97.1 million in engineering &#150; research and development expense, respectively. 

From time to time, we acquire certain licenses to provide us with technology to complement our portfolio of products and product initiatives, such as our engineering development agreement with Torotrak plc and our development agreement with Fallbrook Technologies, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we have invested $0.2 million, $6.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in engineering &#150; research and development expense related to technology-related licenses. 

We maintain test tracks on our Indianapolis, Indiana campus and at our location in Szentgotthard, Hungary for vehicle drive, testing and calibration activities in addition to being a demonstration venue for customers. We also use test track facilities in New Carlisle, Indiana and Apache Junction, Arizona. 

Sales and Marketing Organization 

Our sales and marketing effort is organized along geographic and customer lines and is comprised of marketing, sales and service professionals, supported by application engineers worldwide. In North America, selling efforts in the on-highway end market are organized by distributor area responsibility, OEM sales and national accounts, for our large end users. Outside North America, we manage our sales, marketing, service and application engineering professionals through regional areas of responsibility. These regional management teams distribute OEM service and application engineering resources globally. We manage our defense products sales, marketing, service and application engineering through professionals based in Indianapolis, Indiana and Detroit, Michigan. 

We have developed a marketing strategy to reach OEM customers as well as end users. We target our end users primarily through marketing activities by our sales staff, who directly call on end users and attend local trade shows, targeting specific vocations globally and through our plant tour programs, where end users may test our products on the Indianapolis test track and our enhanced customer experience demonstration track at our Hungary facility. 

While our marketing management uses the term &#147;customer&#148; interchangeably for OEMs and end users, the primary objective of our marketing strategy is to create demand for fully-automatic transmissions through: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; OEM promotion of our products and incorporation of fully-automatic transmissions in their commercial vehicle product offerings; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Allison representative and/or Allison distributor contact with identified, major end users; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our network of independent dealers who contact other end users. The process is interactive, as Allison representatives, Allison distributors and OEM dealers educate customers and respond to the specific applications, requirements and needs of numerous specialty markets. 

Similarly, we work with customers, dealers and OEMs to educate, improve and simplify how they specify vehicles and vehicle systems in order to optimize vehicle performance and fuel consumption. Our field organization also works closely with distributors who, in turn, work with dealers to provide end users with education, parts, service and warranty support. The defense marketing group follows a defined plan that identifies country, vehicle and specific OEMs and then approaches the ultimate end user through a variety of channels. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing strategy provides for distributed capability in manufacturing and assembly of our products for the global commercial vehicle market. Our primary manufacturing facilities, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, consist of approximately 2.3 million square feet of usable manufacturing space in six plants. We also have established customization and parts distribution in the United States, The Netherlands, Brazil, China, Hungary, India and Japan, and plants in Chennai, India and Szentgotthard, Hungary. Our high volume on-highway products are produced in multiple global locations while off-highway, hybrid-propulsion and defense tracked and wheeled products are produced in Indianapolis. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

A significant amount of the part numbers that make up our transmissions are purchased from outside suppliers, and during 2015, we purchased approximately $700.0 million of direct materials and components from outside suppliers. The largest elements of our direct spending are aluminum and steel castings and forgings that are formed by our suppliers into our larger components and assemblies for use in our transmissions. However, our spending on aluminum and steel raw materials directly and indirectly through our purchase of these components constituted approximately 10% of our direct material and component costs in 2015. The balance of our direct and indirect materials and components costs are primarily composed of value-added services and conversion costs. Our supply contracts, along with an intensive supplier selection and performance monitoring process, have enabled us to establish and maintain close relationships with suppliers and have contributed to our overall operating efficiency and industry-leading quality. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. We own 109 issued patents, and we have licensing arrangements with respect to more than 600 additional issued patents. We have more than 300 pending patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products. 

In addition, in conjunction with the sale of Allison (the &#147;Acquisition Transaction&#148;) by Old GM, we acquired an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license of more than 400 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, as well as certain unpatented technology and know-how, to manufacture, use and sell fully-automatic transmissions and certain hybrid-propulsion systems for use in vocational and defense vehicles and off-highway products. Such licenses are subject to certain limitations. See Part I, Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete discussion of these risks and limitations. In addition, we acquired from Old GM an irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license under computer software programs that we use to run our business, including product design. Allison also acquired ownership of trademarks and copyrights relating to our business, subject in some cases to a non-exclusive license back to Old GM for use in connection with its existing six-speed A1000 transmission products, but only up to the termination of production of the A1000 transmission product by General Motors Company (&#147;GM&#148;), the successor to Old GM. GM has assumed Old GM&#146;s obligations under these agreements pursuant to an agreement between us and GM in which GM assumed certain contracts and agreements between us and Old GM (the &#147;Cure Agreement&#148;). 

Seasonality 

Overall, the demand for our products is relatively consistent over the year. However, in typical market conditions, the North American truck market experiences a higher level of production in the first half of the year due to fewer holidays and the practice of plant shutdowns in July and December. Working capital levels do not fluctuate significantly in the normal course for our business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 2,700 employees, with approximately 90% of those employees in the U.S. Approximately 60% of our U.S. employees are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (&#147;UAW&#148;) and are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In November 2012, we entered into a five year agreement with the UAW Local 933 that expires in November 2017. As approximately 50% of our represented employees are currently retirement eligible, we anticipate a shift toward increasing the number of second tier employees over the coming years. There have been no strikes or work stoppages due to Allison-specific issues in over 30 years. 

&#160;

Environmental Compliance 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution. These permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. In addition, certain of our products and our customer&#146;s products are subject to certification requirements by a variety of regulatory bodies. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations. Historically, our costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material to our results. 

Increasing global efforts to control emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants, as well as the shifting focus of regulatory efforts towards total emissions output, have the potential to impact our facilities, costs, products and customers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) has taken action to control greenhouse gases from certain stationary and mobile sources. In addition, the U.S. Congress is considering proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and several states have taken steps, such as adoption of cap and trade programs or other regulatory systems, to address greenhouse gases. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. These developments and further actions that may be taken in the U.S. and in other countries, states or provinces could affect our operations both positively and negatively (e.g., by affecting the demand for or suitability of some of our products). 

We also may be subject to liability as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state or foreign laws for contaminated properties that we currently own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our predecessors sent hazardous substances. Such liability may be joint and several so that we may be liable for more than our share of contamination, and any such liability may be determined without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We or our predecessors have been named potentially responsible parties at contaminated sites from time to time. We do not anticipate our liabilities relating to contaminated sites will be material to our results. 

Under the asset purchase agreement with Old GM, Old GM agreed to indemnify us against certain environmental liabilities, including pre-acquisition offsite waste disposal from our facilities, former facilities associated with the business and any properties or facilities relating to the business that Old GM retained. While we are responsible for environmental liabilities that arise due to post-acquisition activities, GM, as successor to Old GM&#146;s obligations, performed remedial activities at our Indianapolis, Indiana manufacturing facilities relating to historical soil and groundwater contamination at the facilities. GM&#146;s activities were referred to as the &#147;Corrective Action&#148; plan, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, whereby it retained responsibility for completing all obligations covered by a voluntary Corrective Action Agreement that Old GM entered with the EPA. By operation of the asset purchase agreement, once the EPA issues a final decision on GM&#146;s activities under the Corrective Action plan, we assume all responsibility for operating, monitoring and maintaining the ongoing Corrective Action and GM&#146;s indemnification obligations cease. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the EPA determined that GM&#146;s remedial activities were complete and that the migration of any contamination is under control, and published a public notice seeking comment on a draft final decision, the issuance of which would result in us assuming responsibility for operating, monitoring and maintaining the ongoing Corrective Action activities through an anticipated agreed order of consent (&#147;AOC&#148;) with the EPA. As a result of the publishing of the draft final decision, we determined that appropriate liabilities for operating, monitoring and maintaining the ongoing remedial activities could be reasonably estimated and recorded approximately $14.0 million for the estimated undiscounted liabilities to be paid out over the next 30 years. The recorded liabilities will be adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. We expect to fund the expenditures for these activities from operating cash flow. 

On January 27, 2016, the EPA issued a final decision. With the AOC, financial assurance is required by the EPA to complete the operation, monitoring and maintenance activities in the event we fail to do so. This financial assurance can take a variety of forms including, but not limited to meeting certain financial metrics, providing a letter of credit, or securing a bond or an insurance policy. The amount and method by which we will be required to provide financial assurance is expected to be determined in 2016. 

Competition 

We compete on the basis of product performance, quality, price, distribution capability and service in addition to other factors. We face competition from numerous manufacturers of various types of transmissions for commercial vehicles. We also face competition from manufacturers in our international operations and from international manufacturers entering our domestic market. Furthermore, some of our customers are OEMs that manufacture transmissions for their own products. Despite their transmission manufacturing abilities, our existing OEM customers have chosen to purchase certain transmissions from us due to the quality, reliability and strong brand of our transmissions and in order to limit fixed costs, minimize production risks and maintain company focus on commercial vehicle design, production and marketing.
