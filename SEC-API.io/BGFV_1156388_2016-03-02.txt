 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS

General

Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading sporting goods retailer in the western United States, operating 438 stores and an e-commerce platform under the &#8220;Big 5 Sporting Goods&#8221; name as of January 3, 2016. We provide a full-line product offering in a traditional sporting goods store format that averages approximately 11,000 square feet. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we launched our e-commerce platform to also offer selected products online. Our product mix includes athletic shoes, apparel and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, tennis, golf, winter and summer recreation and roller sports.

We believe that over our 61-year history we have developed a reputation with the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer as a convenient neighborhood sporting goods retailer that consistently delivers value on quality merchandise. Our stores carry a wide range of products at competitive prices from well-known brand name manufacturers, including adidas, Coleman, Everlast, New Balance, Nike, Rawlings, Skechers, Spalding, Under Armour and Wilson. We also offer brand name merchandise produced exclusively for us, private label merchandise and specials on quality items we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise. We reinforce our value reputation through weekly print advertising in major and local newspapers, direct mailers and digital marketing programs designed to generate customer traffic, drive net sales and build brand awareness. We also maintain social media sites to enhance distribution capabilities for our promotional offers and to enable communication with our customers.

Robert W. Miller co-founded our company in 1955 with the establishment of five retail locations in California. We sold World War II surplus items until 1963, when we began focusing exclusively on sporting goods and changed our trade name to &#8220;Big 5 Sporting Goods.&#8221; In 1971, we were acquired by Thrifty Corporation, which was subsequently purchased by Pacific Enterprises. In 1992, management bought our company in conjunction with Green Equity Investors, L.P., an affiliate of Leonard Green &#38; Partners, L.P. In 1997, Robert W. Miller, Steven G. Miller and Green Equity Investors, L.P. recapitalized our company so that the majority of our common stock would be owned by our management and employees.

In 2002, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and used the proceeds from that offering, together with credit facility borrowings, to repurchase outstanding high-yield debt and preferred stock, fund management bonuses and repurchase common stock from non-executive employees.

Our accumulated management experience and expertise in sporting goods merchandising, advertising, operations, store development and overall cost management have enabled us to historically generate profitable growth. We believe our historical success can be attributed to a value-based and execution-driven operating philosophy, a controlled growth strategy and a proven business model. Additional information regarding our management experience is available in Item 1, Business , under the sub-heading &#8220;Management Experience,&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In fiscal 2015, we generated net sales of $1,029.1 million, operating income of $26.5 million, net income of $15.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.70.

We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware on October 31, 1997. We conduct our business through Big 5 Corp., a 100%-owned subsidiary incorporated in Delaware on October 27, 1997. We conduct our gift card operations through Big 5 Services Corp., a 100%-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Corp. incorporated in Virginia on December 19, 2003.

Our corporate headquarters are located at 2525 East El Segundo Boulevard, El Segundo, California 90245. Our Internet address is www.big5sportinggoods.com. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments, if any, to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Expansion and Store Development 

Throughout our operating history, we have sought to expand our business with the addition of new stores through a disciplined strategy of controlled growth. Our expansion within the western United States has been systematic and designed to capitalize on our name recognition, economical store format and economies of scale related to distribution and advertising. Over the past five fiscal years, we have opened 65 stores including relocations, an average of 13 new stores annually, of which 48% were in California. In fiscal 2015, we slowed our store growth as we maintained a cautious approach toward store openings in the current retail environment. The following table illustrates the results of our expansion program during the periods indicated:

Our store format enables us to have substantial flexibility regarding new store locations. We have successfully operated stores in major metropolitan areas and in areas with as few as 30,000 people. Our 11,000 average square foot store format differentiates us from superstores that typically average over 35,000 square feet, require larger target markets, are more expensive to operate and require higher net sales per store for profitability.

New store openings normally represent attractive investment opportunities due to the relatively low investment required and the relatively short time necessary before our stores typically become profitable. Our store format normally requires investments of approximately $0.5 million in fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements, net of landlord allowances, and approximately $0.3 million in net working capital with limited pre-opening and real estate expense related to leased locations that are built to our specifications. We seek to maximize new store performance by staffing new store management with experienced personnel from our existing stores.

Our in-house store development personnel analyze new store locations with the assistance of real estate firms that specialize in retail properties. We seek expansion opportunities to further penetrate our established markets, develop recently entered markets and expand into new, contiguous markets with attractive demographic, competitive and economic profiles.

Management Experience

We believe the experience and tenure of our professional staff in the retail industry gives us a competitive advantage. The table below indicates the tenure of our professional staff in some of our key functional areas as of January 3, 2016:

Merchandising

We target the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer with a full-line product offering at a wide variety of price points. We offer a product mix that includes athletic shoes, apparel and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, tennis, golf, winter and summer recreation and roller sports. We believe we offer consistent value to consumers by offering a distinctive merchandise mix that includes a combination of well-known brand name merchandise, merchandise produced exclusively for us under a manufacturer&#8217;s brand name, private label merchandise and specials on quality items we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise.

Through our 61 years of experience across different demographic, competitive and economic markets, we have refined our merchandising strategy in an effort to offer a selection of products that meets customer demand. Specifically, since fiscal 2012 we have strategically refined our merchandise and marketing strategies in order to better align our product mix and promotional efforts with today&#8217;s consumer. We have not made wholesale changes to our model, but rather have adjusted the model in an effort to broad en both our product offering and customer base. We have selectively refined our purchase strategy for certain product categories, and have expanded our assortment of branded products and introduced new products, some at higher price points, in an effort to better appeal to those consumers who might be in a position to engage in more discretionary spending in this economic environment. 

The following table illustrates our mix of soft goods, which are non-durable items such as shirts and shoes, and hard goods, which are durable items such as exercise equipment and baseball gloves, as a percentage of net sales:

We believe we enjoy significant advantages in making opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise because of our strong vendor relationships, purchasing volume and rapid decision-making process. Our strong vendor relationships and purchasing volume also enable us to purchase merchandise produced exclusively for us under a manufacturer&#8217;s brand name which allows us to differentiate our product selection from competition, obtain volume pricing discounts from vendors and offer unique value to our customers. Our weekly advertising highlights our opportunistic buys together with merchandise produced exclusively for us in order to reinforce our reputation as a retailer that offers attractive values to our customers.

In order to complement our branded product offerings, we offer a variety of private label merchandise, which represents approximately 3% of our net sales. Our sale of private label merchandise enables us to provide our customers with a broader selection of quality merchandise at a wider range of price points and allows us the potential to achieve higher margins than on sales of comparable name brand products. Our private label items include shoes, apparel, binoculars, camping equipment, fishing supplies and snowsport equipment. Private label merchandise is sold under trademarks owned by us or licensed by us from third parties. Our owned trademarks include Golden Bear, Harsh, Pacifica and Rugged Exposure, all of which are registered as federal trademarks. The renewal dates for these trademark registrations range from 2016 to 2018. Our licensed trademarks include Beach Feet, Bearpaw, Body Glove, GoFit, Hi-Tec, Morrow and The Realm. One of the license agreements for these trademarks expires in 2018 and the other license agreements renew automatically on an annual basis unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice. We intend to renew these trademark registrations and license agreements if we are still using the trademarks in commerce and they continue to provide value to us at the time of renewal.

Seasonality influences our buying patterns and we purchase merchandise for seasonal activities in advance of a season. We tailor our merchandise selection on a store-by-store basis in an effort to satisfy each region&#8217;s specific needs and seasonal buying habits. In the fourth fiscal quarter we normally experience higher inventory purchase volumes in anticipation of the winter and holiday selling season.

Our buyers, who average 15 years of experience with us, work in collaboration with senior management to determine and enhance product selection, promotion and pricing of our merchandise mix. Management utilizes integrated merchandising, business intelligence analytics, distribution, point-of-sale and financial information systems to con tinuously refine our merchandise mix, pricing strategy, advertising effectiveness and inventory levels to best serve the needs of our customers. 

Advertising and Marketing

Through years of targeted advertising, we have solidified our reputation for offering quality products at attractive prices. We have advertised predominantly through weekly print advertisements since 1955. We typically utilize four-page color advertisements to highlight promotions across our merchandise categories. We believe our print advertising, which includes an average weekly distribution of approximately 14.3 million newspaper inserts or mailers, consistently reaches more households in our established markets than that of our full-line sporting goods competitors. For non-subscribers of newspapers, we provide our print advertisements through carrier delivery and direct mail. The consistency and reach of our print advertising programs drive sales and create high customer awareness of the name &#8220;Big 5 Sporting Goods.&#8221;

We use our own professional in-house advertising staff to generate our advertisements, including design, layout, production and media management. Our in-house advertising department provides management with the flexibility to react quickly to merchandise trends and to maximize the effectiveness of our weekly inserts and mailers. We are able to effectively target different population zones for our advertising expenditures. We place inserts in over 225 newspapers throughout our markets, supplemented in many areas by mailer distributions to create market saturation.

Though print advertising is the core of our promotional advertising, we also promote our products through digital marketing programs that include e-mail marketing (the &#8220;E-Team&#8221;), search engine marketing, social media including Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, mobile programs and other website initiatives. 

Our digital promotional strategy is designed to provide additional opportunities to connect with potential customers and enable us to promote the Big 5 brand. Our e-mail marketing program invites our customers to subscribe to our E-Team for weekly advertisements, special deals and product information disseminated on a regular basis. We use search engine marketing methods as a means to reach those customers searching the Internet to gather information about our products. Within our social media program, our customers have the opportunity to engage in conversations with other sports-minded people and receive exclusive information about new products and unique weekly offers. All of these marketing methods are intended to simplify the shopping experience for our customers and further demonstrate our commitment to provide great brands at great values.

Our website features a broad representation of our product assortment and provides visibility of store inventory to our customers, thereby enabling them to determine if items featured on our website are in-stock in one or more of our store locations. In fiscal 2014, we launched our e-commerce platform to deliver an online shopping experience to our customers. We continue to develop our online capabilities to meet customer expectations of being able to shop at their convenience.

We have developed a strong cause marketing platform through our 16-year support of the March of Dimes annual fundraising campaign and numerous other charities and organizations throughout our marketplace. We also build brand awareness by providing sponsorship support of established, high profile events that benefit our customers&#8217; active lifestyles, such as the &#8220;LA Marathon&#8221; in Los Angeles, California, and the &#8220;Duke City Marathon&#8221; in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for which we are the title sponsor. Additionally, in fiscal 2013, we entered into a three-year sponsorship agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers, Inc. (&#8220;Lakers&#8221;) to be the &#8220;Official Sporting Goods Retailer of the Lakers&#8221; within the Lakers&#8217; marketing territory.

We offer a loyalty program that provides youth-league organizations the ability to earn cash rebates and team discounts through their supporters&#8217; purchases at our stores.

Vendor Relationships

We have developed strong vendor relationships over the past 61 years. We currently purchase merchandise from over 700 vendors. In fiscal 2015, only one vendor represented greater than 5% of total purchases, at 10.8%. We believe current relationships with our vendors are good. We benefit from the long-term working relationships with vendors that our senior management and our buyers have carefully nurtured throughout our history.

Information Technology Systems 

We have fully integrated information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems that support critical business functions, such as sales reporting, merchandise management, inventory receiving and distribution functions and provide pertinent information for financial reporting, as well as robust business intelligence and retail analytics tools. We manage IT solutions for e-commerce, email, backup systems and systems support, as well as all networks that connect our system users to enterprise-level systems and tools. This includes connecting our store systems to enterprise-level systems via a managed wide area network (&#8220;WAN&#8221;) connection comprised of DSL, T1 and cable communications with 4G or satellite backup for purchasing card (i.e., credit and debit card) encryption, tokenization, authorization and processing, as well as daily polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level. The stores also use this WAN connection for access to valuable tools such as collaboration, online training, workforce management, online hiring, company website functions and corporate communications. Our disaster recovery site, which is located in Phoenix, Arizona, houses redundant network and application systems to be used in the event of an emergency or unplanned outage to our production systems. We believe our IT systems are effectively supporting our current operations and continue to provide a foundation for future growth.

Distribution

We operate a distribution center located in Riverside, California, that services all of our stores. The facility has approximately 953,000 square feet of storage and office space. The distribution center warehouse management system is fully integrated with our enterprise-level IT systems and provides comprehensive warehousing and distribution capabilities. We generally distribute merchandise from our distribution center to our stores at least once per week, using our fleet of leased tractors, as well as contract carriers. Our lease for the distribution center is scheduled to expire on August 31, 2020, and includes two additional five-year renewal options.

In November 2015, we commenced operations at an additional 171,000 square foot distribution space adjacent to our distribution center in Riverside, California that will enable us to more efficiently fulfill our expanding distribution requirements. Our lease for this additional facility is scheduled to expire on August 31, 2020, and includes four additional five-year renewal options. 

We operate a small distribution hub in Oregon to help mitigate fuel costs. This approximately 12,000 square-foot facility enables us to ship full trailers of product from our Riverside distribution center to the Pacific Northwest, where we separate products for regional delivery. This distribution hub has greatly reduced the number of transportation miles logged to distribute our product to the Pacific Northwest. Our lease for the Oregon hub is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2019, and includes four additional five-year renewal options.

Industry and Competition

The retail market for sporting goods is highly competitive. In general, competition tends to fall into the following five basic categories:

Sporting Goods Superstores. Stores in this category typically are larger than 35,000 square feet and tend to be free-standing locations. These stores emphasize high volume sales and a large number of stock-keeping units. Examples include Academy Sports &#38; Outdoors, Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods, The Sports Authority and Sport Chalet. 

Traditional Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of traditional sporting goods chains, including us. These stores range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and are frequently located in regional malls and multi-store shopping centers. The traditional chains typically carry a varied assortment of merchandise and attempt to position themselves as convenient neighborhood stores. Sporting goods retailers operating stores within this category include Hibbett Sports and Modell&#8217;s. 

Specialty Sporting Goods Stores. Specialty sporting goods retailers are stores that typically carry a wide assortment of one specific product category, such as athletic shoes, golf, or outdoor equipment. Examples of these retailers include Bass Pro Shops, Cabela&#8217;s, Foot Locker, Gander Mountain, Golfsmith and REI. This category also includes pro shops that often are single-store operations. 

Mass Merchandisers. This category includes discount retailers such as Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart and department stores such as JC Penney, Kohl&#8217;s and Sears. These stores range in size from 50,000 to 200,000 square feet and are primarily located in regional malls, shopping centers or on free-standing sites. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel represent a small portion of the total merchandise in these stores and the selection is often more limited than in other sporting goods retailers. 

E-commerce and Catalog Retailers. This category consists of many retailers that sell a broad array of new and used sporting goods products via e-commerce or catalogs, including Amazon.com. The types of retailers me ntioned above may also sell their products through e-commerce. E-commerce has been a rapidly growing sales channel, particularly with younger consumers, and an increasing source of competition in the sporting goods retail industry. 

In competing with the retailers discussed above, we focus on what we believe are the primary factors of competition in the sporting goods retail industry, including experienced and knowledgeable personnel; customer service; breadth, depth, price and quality of merchandise offered; advertising; purchasing and pricing policies; effective sales techniques; direct involvement of senior officers in monitoring store operations; enterprise-level IT systems and store location and format.

Employees

As of January 3, 2016, we had approximately 9,000 active full and part-time employees. The General Teamsters, Airline, Aerospace and Allied Employees, Warehousemen, Drivers, Construction, Rock and Sand, Local Union No. 986, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#8220;Local 986&#8221;) represents approximately 450 hourly employees in our distribution center and select stores. In October 2012, we negotiated a five-year contract with Local 986 for our distribution center bargaining unit employees, and in November 2012, we negotiated a five-year contract with Local 986 for our store bargaining unit employees. Both contracts were retroactive to September 1, 2012 and expire on August 31, 2017. We have not had a strike or work stoppage in over 30 years, although such a disruption could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial results. We believe we provide working conditions and wages that are comparable to those offered by other retailers in the sporting goods industry and that employee relations are good.

Employee Training

We have developed a comprehensive training program that is tailored for each store and corporate position. All new store employees are given an orientation and reference materials that stress excellence in customer service, product knowledge and selling skills. All full-time store employees, including salespeople, cashiers and management trainees, receive additional training specific to their job responsibilities. With over 100 available learning resources and multiple training opportunities hosted every month, our tiered curriculum includes seminars, interactive online courses, live webinars, online message boards, reference guides, individual instruction and performance evaluations designed to promote employee development. The manager trainee program utilizes a blended learning approach that includes classroom-style courses, online courses and quizzes, live webinars, self-directed and one-on-one training designed to teach key operational responsibilities such as product merchandising strategy, HR compliance, policies, procedures, systems utilization, loss prevention and inventory control. Moreover, each manager trainee must complete a progressive series of outlines and evaluations in order to be considered for the next successive level of advancement. Ongoing store management training includes advanced merchandising, delegation, personnel management, scheduling, payroll control, harassment prevention and loss prevention. We also provide unique opportunities for our employees to gain first-hand knowledge about our products through periodic &#8220;hands-on&#8221; training, seminars, online courses and webinars. Our training strategy and learning management system enables us to efficiently manage, monitor, assign and report employee training online.

Description of Service Marks and Trademarks

We use the &#8220;Big 5&#8221; and &#8220;Big 5 Sporting Goods&#8221; names as service marks in connection with our business operations and have registered these names as federal service marks. The renewal dates for these service mark registrations are in 2025 and 2023, respectively. We have also registered the names Golden Bear, Harsh, Pacifica and Rugged Exposure as federal trademarks under which we sell a variety of merchandise. The renewal dates for these trademark registrations range from 2016 to 2018. We intend to renew these service mark and trademark registrations if we are still using the marks in commerce and they continue to provide value to us at the time of renewal.
