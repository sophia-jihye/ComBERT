General 

The Children's Place, Inc. is the largest pure-play children's specialty apparel retailer in North America. We sell apparel, accessories, footwear and other items for children. We design, contract to manufacture, sell at retail and wholesale, and license to sell trend right, high-quality merchandise at value prices, the substantial majority of which is under the proprietary &#8220;The Children's Place&#8221;, "Place" and "Baby Place" brand names. Our stores offer a friendly and convenient shopping environment. The Children's Place has differentiated departments and serves the wardrobe needs of Girls and Boys (sizes 4-14, with size 16 available online), Toddler Girls and Boys (sizes 12 mos.-5T) and Baby (sizes 0-18 mos.). Stores are visually merchandised by 

size segment. &#32;&#32; Our merchandise is also available online at www.childrensplace.com . Our customers are able to shop online, at their convenience, including from their mobile devices, and receive the same high quality, value-priced merchandise and customer service that are available in our physical stores, as well as merchandise which is exclusive to our e-commerce site. 

The Children's Place was founded in 1969. The Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 1997. As of January 30, 2016, we operated 1,069 stores throughout North America as well as our online store. During Fiscal 2015, we opened four stores compared to 25 in Fiscal 2014, and we closed 32 stores in Fiscal 2015, compared to 35 in Fiscal 2014. Also in Fiscal 2015, we continued to expand into international markets through territorial agreements with franchisees, and in our wholesale business, we continue to add accounts and expand categories and distribution to our customers. 

Jane Elfers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has established four key strategic initiatives that we are executing to improve sales and margin, as follows: 

1. 

Superior Product - &#32; Product will always be our number one priority. We continue to significantly differentiate and upgrade the look of our merchandise, which has resonated well with our customers. In addition to apparel, we offer a full line of accessories and footwear and other items so busy moms can quickly and easily put together head-to-toe outfits. 

2. 

Business Transformation through Technology &#32;- We continue to make progress on our business transformation initiatives to improve sales and margin. The insights from the implementation of our assortment planning tool are delivering gross margin benefits by adding enhanced data driven analytics to our internal processes leading to a better optimization of our overall buys and a better matching of the breadth of assortment with the depth of inventory. Our new inventory allocation and replenishment tool also went live during the back-to-school Fiscal 2015 season. These initiatives have contributed to improved gross margin during Fiscal 2015. Additionally, our digital initiatives continue to gain traction and are focused on driving improvements in customer acquisition, retention and engagement. We also implemented a new digital order management system during Fiscal 2015 which will enable us to pilot omni-channel fulfillment capabilities in Fiscal 2016. 

3. 

Growth through Alternate Channels of Distribution &#32;- We are pursuing new channels of distribution, including international expansion and wholesale distribution. We continued our international expansion program with our franchise partners adding 29 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) during Fiscal 2015 bringing our total count to 102, operating in 16 countries. During Fiscal 2015, in India we opened our first retail store, our first ever shop in shop location and also launched an e-commerce business with our partner Arvind Lifestyle Brands. We also announced a new partnership with El Palacio de Hierro to open free-standing stores and shop in shops in Mexico, and we opened our first shop in shop in Mexico. In our wholesale business, we expanded categories of merchandise available for distribution to our customers during Fiscal 2015. 

4. 

Fleet Optimization &#32;- We continue to evaluate our store fleet as part of our fleet optimization initiative to improve store productivity and plan to close approximately 200 underperforming stores through fiscal 2017, which includes the 32 stores we closed during Fiscal 2015, the 35 stores we closed in Fiscal 2014 and the 41 stores we closed during Fiscal 2013. Our customer segmentation analysis helps us to better understand customer shopping habits at the store level in order to understand what our ideal store portfolio should look like. These closures should ultimately result in operating margin accretion due to sales transfer, low cost of exit and the elimination of the underperforming locations. In those markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores along with the e-commerce business become more productive from both a Comparative Retail Sales and profitability perspective. These results further our commitment to executing this optimization program while dramatically slowing down new store openings. 

Overlaying these growth initiatives is talent. Talent ultimately defines our success, and over the past five years we have built a best-in-class management team focused on consistent product execution and operational excellence. This talented team is a significant competitive advantage for our Company. 

Underlying these growth initiatives is a commitment to operational excellence. The Company&#8217;s commitment to operational excellence coupled with its talent, disciplined expense management, improving store operations, and our finance, compliance, legal and human resources areas, forms the strong base necessary to support our long-term growth initiatives. 

Segment Reporting 

In accordance with the &#8220; Segment Reporting &#8221; topic of the FASB ASC, we report segment data based on geography: The Children&#8217;s Place U.S. and The Children&#8217;s Place International. Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com . Included in The Children&#8217;s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico based stores and revenue from our U.S. based wholesale customers. Included in The Children's Place International segment are our Canadian 

based stores, revenue from the Company's Canada wholesale customer, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes. Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment. Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services are managed by The Children&#8217;s Place U.S. segment. Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children&#8217;s Place International segment based primarily on net sales. The assets related to these functions are not allocated. We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business circumstances. Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales and we have no major customers that account for more than 10% &#32;of our net sales. The following tables show by segment our net sales and operating income for the past three fiscal years, and total assets as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 (in thousands):

Net sales from The Children's Place International are primarily derived from revenues from Canadian operations. Our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in Canada, have operating results based in foreign currencies and are thus subject to the fluctuations of the corresponding translation rates into U.S. dollars. For Fiscal 2015, the effects of these translation rate changes on net sales was a decrease of $29.9 million.

Key Capabilities 

Our objective is to deliver high-quality, value-priced, trend-right assortments for children. Our assortment offers one stop shopping across apparel, footwear, accessories and other items for children. Our strategies to achieve this objective are as follows: 

Merchandising Strategy 

Our merchandising strategy is to offer a compelling assortment of apparel, footwear and accessories for children that enable our customer to outfit their child. Our assortments are modern and colorful, are balanced by category and lifestyle, and are easy to put together. We build our deliveries by season and flow new product to our stores monthly. 

High Quality/Value Pricing 

We believe that offering high-quality, trend-right, age-appropriate merchandise under &#8220;The Children's Place&#8221;, "Place" and "Baby Place" brand names at value prices is our competitive advantage. We design and merchandise our branded apparel, footwear and accessories to offer a compelling value to our customers. 

Brand Image 

We focus on strengthening our brand image and customer loyalty for &#8220;The Children's Place&#8221; by: 

&#8226; 

Consistently offering high-quality and age-appropriate products and trend-right fashion at value prices in a friendly and convenient shopping environment; 

&#8226; 

Providing coordinated outfits and accessories for our customers' lifestyle needs; 

&#8226; 

Creating strong merchandising and visual presentations to create a compelling in-store experience; 

&#8226; 

Emphasizing our great value and fashion in marketing visuals to convey a consistent brand message across all channels; 

&#8226; 

Segmenting and leveraging our customer database to frequently communicate with our customers and tailor promotions to maximize customer satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

Using our MyPLACE Loyalty Rewards Program to drive customer engagement; and 

&#8226; 

Providing exclusive assortments in our e-commerce business to further expand the breadth of our offerings and brand recognition. 

Low-Cost Global Sourcing 

We design, source and contract to manufacture the substantial majority of The Children's Place branded products. We believe that this is essential to assuring the consistency and quality of our merchandise, as well as our ability to deliver value to our customers. We are strengthening relationships with our most important vendors. Through these relationships and our extensive knowledge of low cost sourcing on a global scale, we are able to offer our customers high-quality products at value prices. We maintain a network of sourcing offices globally in order to communicate with our vendors efficiently and respond to changing business needs effectively. Our sourcing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai have allowed us substantial access to the Greater Asia market, giving us access to a wide range of vendors. Our sourcing offices in India, Bangladesh and Vietnam, and contract associates on the ground in Greater Africa, Cambodia, Indonesia and other countries in which we source products, allow us to maintain and/or reduce our current merchandise costs by capitalizing on new sourcing opportunities while maintaining our product quality. 

Merchandising Process 

The strong collaboration between our cross functional teams in design, merchandising, sourcing and planning and allocation departments have enabled us to build our brand. 

Design 

The Design team gathers information from trends, color services, research and trade shows. Findings and concepts are presented to the Merchandising team. 

Merchandising 

Each quarter we develop seasonal strategies and the Merchandising team sets the strategies for future seasons. 

Planning and Allocation 

The Planning and Allocation organization works collaboratively with the Merchandising, Finance and Global Sourcing teams to develop annual and seasonal sales and margin plans to support our financial objectives and merchandising strategies. 

Further, this team plans the flow of inventory to ensure that we are adequately supporting floor sets and key promotional periods. Special attention is paid to our store types, as they differ in capacity and layout. 

Production, Quality Assurance and Social Compliance 

During Fiscal 2015, we engaged approximately 118 independent vendors located primarily in Greater Asia. We continue to pursue global sourcing opportunities to support our inventory needs and to seek to control merchandise costs. 

We contract for the manufacture of the substantial majority of the products we sell. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Increases in manufacturing costs negatively impact our business, and we seek to manage the risks of operational difficulties posed by contract manufacturers, including the availability of adequate manufacturing capacity, errors in complying with our product specifications, insufficient quality control processes, failures to meet production deadlines, worker and environmental safety concerns, and political and social instability in certain regions. 

During Fiscal 2015, we purchased approximately 92% of our total merchandise directly without the aid of third party commissioned buying agents. We currently have one agency agreement with a commissioned independent agent for accessories who assists in sourcing, oversees production, provides quality inspection and ensures timely delivery of product. We will continue to evaluate the use of commissioned buying agents, but we expect that the substantial majority of our sourcing volume will continue to be managed through our own independent sourcing offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam. 

During Fiscal 2015, we sourced approximately 27% of our total goods from China, approximately 16% from Bangladesh, approximately 16% from Vietnam and approximately 12% from Indonesia. No other country accounted for 10% or more of our production. 

We do not accept finished goods until each purchase order receives formal certification of compliance from our own quality assurance associates, agents, appointed third party inspectors or our certified/recognized auditors. Our product testing programs meet the testing protocols adopted under the CPSIA. 

In addition to our quality assurance procedures, we administer a responsible sourcing program that seeks to protect our company and enhance our brand by continually providing guidance in-line with industry standards to our global vendors in their efforts to provide safe and otherwise appropriate working conditions for their employees. These efforts are part of an ongoing process to encourage the continued improvement by our vendors of factory working conditions, and ultimately, the lives of their employees who make our product. This is achieved through encouraging our vendors to comply with local legal regulations, as well as industry-standards and socially responsible business practices. The components of our program are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Vendor Code of Conduct &#32;- By formally acknowledging and agreeing to our code of conduct, our vendors affirm their commitment to integrate compliance with local law and industry standards into their manufacturing and sourcing practices. Topics covered by these standards include child labor, involuntary or forced labor, slavery and human-trafficking, coercion/harassment, discrimination, health and safety, compensation, working hours, freedom of association, environment, unauthorized subcontracting, security practices and undue influence of independent auditors. 

&#8226; 

Ongoing Auditing Program - We administer a factory auditing program staffed by our internal sourcing team and/or professional third party auditors who visit factory locations at least once a year on average to provide insight into general factory working conditions and other production characteristics in all factories that manufacture The Children's Place products. With this information, we can understand factories&#8217; challenges, help the factories identify non-compliance with industry standards and offer guidance on corrective action plans for the factories to achieve better compliance, All factories that are approved for The Children&#8217;s Place production must undergo a social compliance audit prior to any orders being placed and at least once annually thereafter. 

&#8226; 

Corrective Action Plans &#32;- Following each social audit, a corrective action plan outlines any areas of non-compliance identified through the factory audit. Each factory is expected to develop a remediation plan and remediation timeline for any non-compliance found. Through follow-up social audits, we assess a factory&#8217;s progress in achieving its remediation plan. It is our preference to work with factories to remediate and achieve compliance rather than terminate our relationship; however, where there is serious non-compliance of critical standards, repeated non-compliance or failure of the factories to invest in continued improvement, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship. 

&#8226; 

Vendor Factory Engagement &#32;- Our responsible sourcing team provides guidance and training to vendors and factories in order to help vendors and factories improve compliance with industry standards. Our goal is to serve as a resource for vendors and factories as they develop and strengthen their capabilities to better manage the working conditions of their employees. 

&#8226; 

Worker Education and Community Investment &#32;- In some cases, we will provide support to factories that wish to implement worker training and community investment initiatives. We have encouraged factories to invest in health and nutrition education for their workers, which we have financially supported in factories in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. 

Additionally, under our responsible sourcing program we monitor changes in local laws and other conditions (e.g., worker safety, workers' right of association and political instability) in the countries from which we source in order to identify and assess potential risks to our sourcing capabilities.

Store Concepts 

At The Children's Place, our store concepts consist of &#8220;Tech 2 &#8221;, &#8220;Apple-Maple&#8221;, &#8220;Technicolor&#8221; and &#8220;Outlet&#8221; formats, as follows: 

Tech 2 &#32;- Our current Tech 2 store format creates an open, brightly lit environment for customers. Tech 2 &#32;features crisp white floor-wall fixtures to ensure the product is the focal point, using color to brand and create shop identifiers. Stores using our Tech 2 &#32;store format cost us approximately 35% less to build than our prior Technicolor store format. The average store is approximately 4,100 square feet and as of January 30, 2016, approximately 46% of our stores used this concept. 

Technicolor &#32;- This retired store format was significantly more expensive to design, build, maintain and staff than stores using the Tech 2 format. The average store using the Technicolor format is approximately 4,900 square feet and as of January 30, 2016, approximately 20% of our stores were of this concept. 

Apple-Maple &#32;- This retired store format features light wood floors, fixtures and trim. The average store size using this format is approximately 4,200 square feet and as of January 30, 2016, approximately 21% of our stores were of this concept. 

Outlet &#32;- The average outlet store size using this format is approximately 7,100 square feet. As of January 30, 2016, approximately 13% of our stores were in this format. Our outlet stores are strategically placed within each market to provide a discount value alternative. 

Fleet Optimization 

As part of our store fleet optimization initiative, we plan to close approximately 200 underperforming stores through fiscal 2017, which includes the 32 stores we closed during Fiscal 2015, the 35 stores we closed in Fiscal 2014 and the 41 stores we closed during Fiscal 2013. The stores selected for closure underperformed the fleet average and do not meet our hurdle rates and other criteria. Our customer segmentation analysis helps us to better understand customer shopping habits at the store level in order to understand what our ideal store portfolio should look like. These closures should ultimately result in operating margin accretion due to sales transfer, low cost of exit and the elimination of the underperforming locations. In those markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores along with the e-commerce business become more productive from both a Comparative Retail Sales and profitability perspective. These results further our commitment to executing this optimization program while dramatically slowing down new store openings. 

We continuously review the performance of our store fleet. We base our decisions to open, close or remodel stores on a variety of factors, including lease terms, landlord negotiations, market dynamics and projected financial performance. When assessing whether to close a store, we also consider remaining lease life and current financial performance. 

Internet Sales (&#8220;e-commerce&#8221;) 

Our U.S. and International segments each include an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and &#32; e-commerce growth remains one of our top strategic priorities. We are committed to delivering a world class, end-to-end user experience to our customers from product assortment and website design to operations, fulfillment and customer service. We are further committed to delivering these experiences to our customers when, where and how they are looking to access the brand, accounting for cross-channel behavior, growth of mobile devices, and the growing interest in our brand from international audiences. As such, we will continue to make required investments in back-end infrastructure, as well as front-end technology to deliver on this commitment. We believe that the critical investments made in areas such as e-commerce infrastructure and mobile optimization as well as additional front-end website features have improved our customers' experience. 

International Franchises and Wholesale 

We continued our international expansion program with our franchise partners adding 29 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) during Fiscal 2015 bringing our total count to 102, operating in 16 countries. During Fiscal 2015, in India we opened our first retail store, our first ever shop in shop location and also launched an e-commerce business with our partner Arvind Lifestyle Brands. We also announced a new partnership with El Palacio de Hierro to open free-standing stores and shop in shops in Mexico, and we opened our first shop in shop in Mexico during Fiscal 2015. We generate revenues from our franchisees from the sale of products and sales royalties. In our wholesale business, we expanded categories of merchandise available for distribution to our customers during Fiscal 2015. 

Store Operations 

The Children's Place U.S. store operations are organized into five regions. We employ two U.S. Zone Vice Presidents and one Canadian Vice President who oversee our operations of both Place and Outlet stores and to whom regional directors report. A regional director oversees a region and has between 13 and 14 district managers reporting to them. Each district manager is responsible for nine to 16 stores. Our stores are staffed by a store management team and sales associates, with additional part-time associates hired to support seasonal needs. Our store management teams spend a high percentage of their time on the store's selling floor providing direction, motivation, and development to store personnel. To maximize selling productivity, our teams emphasize greeting, replenishment, presentation standards, procedures and controls. In order to motivate our store management, we offer a monthly incentive compensation plan that awards bonuses for achieving certain financial goals. 

Seasonality 

Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with heavier concentrations of sales during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Our first fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, third fiscal quarter results are dependent upon back-to-school sales, and our fourth fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during 

the holiday season. The business is also subject to seasonal shifts due to unseasonable weather conditions. The following table shows the quarterly distribution, as a percentage of the full year, of net sales and operating income (loss):

Marketing 

The Children's Place is a well recognized brand, with a trend right offering and a compelling value proposition. We attempt to build on our brand recognition through a multi-channel marketing campaign that aligns store front windows, in-store marketing, internet marketing, and our customer loyalty program. Our direct marketing program utilizes both on and off-line channels. 

We promote customer loyalty through a loyalty rewards program called MyPLACE Rewards. At the end of Fiscal 2015, our MyPLACE Rewards loyalty program had 7.9 million members who accounted for approximately 67% of sales. We also promote customer loyalty through our private label credit card. Our card is issued to our customers for use exclusively at The Children's Place stores and online at www.childrensplace.com, and credit is extended to such customers through a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to us. Approximately 11% of our net sales during Fiscal 2015 were transacted using our private label credit card. In Fiscal 2015, we entered into an agreement with a new private label credit card provider, with the transition to the new provider expected to occur during Fiscal 2016. The Company also anticipates transitioning to a new customer loyalty program in Fiscal 2016. We promote affinity and loyalty through our marketing programs by utilizing specialized incentive programs. 

Distribution 

In the United States we own and operate a 700,000 square foot distribution center in Alabama which supports both U.S. retail store operations and U.S. e-commerce operations. In Canada we operate a 95,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario for our Canadian retail store operations. We also use a third-party provider to support our Canadian e-commerce operations. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support seasonal warehousing needs. We also use a third-party provider of warehousing and logistics services in Malaysia to support our international franchise business. 

Competition 

The children's apparel, footwear and accessories retail markets are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are specialty stores and mass merchandisers, including Target Corporation and GapKids, babyGap and Old Navy (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Gymboree Corporation, Justice (a division of The Ascena Retail Group, Inc.), Carter's, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and other department stores, as well as other discount stores such as Walmart Stores, Inc. We also compete with regional retail chains, catalog companies and Internet retailers. One or more of our competitors are present in substantially all of the areas in which we have stores. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

&#8220;The Children's Place,&#8221; &#8220;babyPLACE,&#8221; &#8220;Place&#8221; and certain other marks have been registered as trademarks and/or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and other foreign countries. The registration of the trademarks and the service marks may be renewed to extend the original registration period indefinitely, provided the marks are still in use. We intend to continue to use and protect our trademarks and service marks and maintain their registrations. We have also registered our trademarks in other countries where we source our products and where we have established and 

anticipate establishing franchising operations. We believe our trademarks and service marks have received broad recognition and are of significant value to our business. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including product safety, consumer protection, privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and e-commerce. We also are subject to similar international laws and regulations affecting our business. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

Each of our product styles currently covered by the CPSIA and the CCPSA are appropriately tested to meet current standards. 

Virtually all of our merchandise is manufactured by third-party factories located outside of the United States. These products are imported and are subject to U.S. and Canadian customs laws, which impose tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain imported products, including textiles, apparel, footwear and accessories. We currently are not restricted by any such duties in the operation of our business. In addition, custom duties and tariffs do not comprise a material portion of the cost of our products. 

Employees

None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
