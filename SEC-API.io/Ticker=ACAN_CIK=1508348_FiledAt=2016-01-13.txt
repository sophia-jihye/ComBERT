 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

AmeriCann, Inc. develops, will own and supports advanced medical cannabis cultivation and processing facilities nationwide. We have a multi-market portfolio of over 1,000,000 square feet of sustainable cannabis production infrastructure in various stages of development which consists of 125,000 square feet of approved cultivation and processing infrastructure on the 5 acres located at 5280 Monaco St. in Denver, and site approval for 977,000 square feet of cultivation, processing and administration infrastructure at the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center (&#8220;MMCC&#8221;). 

AmeriCann&#8217;s team includes board members, consultants, engineers and architects who specialize in traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, medical research, facility construction, regulatory compliance, security, marijuana cultivation and genetics, extraction processes, and infused product development. 

&#160;

To support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients in their communities we initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. The initial step in becoming a preferred partner involves an application on our website. Based on the initial inquiry, we determine if the location, market, type of project and economics support additional due diligence. Currently, we have one current Preferred Partner in Colorado, which is 4900 Jackson, LLC. Through this program we provide an essential set of resources including advance cultivation facilties, access to a team of experts and in certain cases, capital for our partner&#8217;s businesses. This support is designed to assist our Preferred Partners in newly regulated markets. In addition, AmeriCann&#8217;s team has actively participated in winning cannabis licenses in competitive application processes throughout the country including Massachusetts and Illinois. 

&#160;

AmeriCann plans to lease facilities to its Preferred Partners that will be designed with AmeriCann&#8217;s propriety cultivation and processing system called &#8220;Cannopy.&#8221; Cannopy uniquely combines experience from traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, regulatory compliance and cannabis cultivation to create factilities and procedures. Cannopy includes automation throughout the production life-cycle, customized workflow processes, monitoring and controls, and top-line security systems. Cannopy empowers Preferred Partners to consistently produce medical marijuana for patients at the lowest cost in the most efficient, compliant manner. We provide initial and on-going training, policies, practices and procedures to operate the state-of-the-art facilities. 

The expanding cannabis industry requires extensive real estate to meet the growing needs of patients. AmeriCann assists our Preferred Partners with the identification, design, permitting, acquisition, development and operation of scalable infrastructure to cultivate and to dispense medical marijuana in regulated markets. 

As an early market participant, we seek to leverage our leadership and competitive strengths in a formative industry to increase market share as the cannabis industry expands. 

Company History 

We were incorporated on June 25, 2010 under the laws of Delaware. We were established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP"). Under AP's Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, we were incorporated to: (i) hold any interest which AP retained in the development of an MRI facility in Nevada; and (ii) issue shares of our common stock to AP's general unsecured creditors, administrative creditors, and shareholders in order to enhance their opportunity to recover from the bankruptcy estate. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Since we lacked the resources to effectively develop an MRI facility, in June, 2012 we decided to promote medical tourism by providing information on a website for those seeking to travel abroad for healthcare services. We planned to generate revenue by selling advertising to healthcare providers and related businesses including hotels and travel businesses. 

In September 2013 we abandoned our business plan relating to promoting medical tourism. 

In January 2014, we began operating in accordance with our new business plan. 

On January 17, 2014, Strategic Capital Partners, LLC (&#8220;SCP&#8221;) a firm controlled by Benjamin J. Barton, acquired 14,950,000 shares of our outstanding common stock from a group of our shareholders, resulting in a change of control. 

&#160;

On February 21, 2014 we changed our name from Nevada Health Scan, Inc. to AmeriCann, Inc. and declared a stock dividend in the amount of four shares of common stock for each issued and outstanding share of common stock. 

On February 24, 2014 SCP returned 65,750,000 shares of our common stock to us. 

During March and April 2014 we sold 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to private investors at a price of $0.75 per share. Benjamin J. Barton, one of our officers and directors, purchased 400,000 shares as an investment. 

During July 2014 we raised $2,373,000 through a private sale of 791,000 Units at a price of $3.00 per Unit. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant. Each warrant allows the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $8.00 per share anytime on or before April 30, 2018. Benjamin J. Barton purchased 666,667 Units for cash as an investment. 

During the summer of 2014 we entered into a Financing and Consulting Agreement with Nature's Own Wellness Centers, a licensed Colorado cannabis dispensary owner and grower. Pursuant to the agreement, we loaned Nature's Own $1,000,000. The proceeds of the secured loan will be used by Nature's Own to convert an existing 15,000 square foot warehouse into a new cannabis growing and processing facility. 

The loan had a 30-month term, with interest at 18% annually, and required monthly payments of approximately $50,000 of principal and interest and $10,000 in consulting fees to us. Nature's Own had agreed to pay $300,000 in consulting fees for its cannabis operations over the 30-month period. Over the term of the 30-month loan, the agreement called for us to receive average monthly payments of principal, interest and consulting fees in excess of $56,000. 

Effective January 1, 2015 we modified our loan and consulting agreement with Natures Own. The modification to the loan agreement eliminated required principal payments for January through May 2015 and increased the final principal payment due on December 1, 2016 to $182,531. Principal and interest payments resumed at June 1, 2015 at $32,600 per month. The consulting agreement was modified to extend the term of the consulting agreement by five months to May 31, 2017. 

In early May 2015, Nature's Own's interest in the growing and processing facility was purchased by 4900 Jackson, LLC, and 4900 Jackson, LLC assumed Nature's Own obligations under the loan and consulting agreements. On May 20, 2015, we modified the loan and consulting agreements with 4900 Jackson, LLC to provide for an accelerated principal payment to us of $300,000, a reduction in the interest rate from 18% to 12%, to extend the maturity date to May 1, 2017, and to reduce the monthly fee from $10,000 to $5,000 through May 31, 2017. 

On July 31, 2014 we closed on an all cash purchase of a five-acre parcel of land located in north central Denver, Colorado. The total purchase price for the property was $2,250,000. The property is currently zoned for cannabis cultivation and processing by the City and County of Denver. 

On August 14, 2015 we signed an agreement to sell the five-acre parcel for a total purchase price of $2,500,000. The closing of the transaction was to take place on or before September 14, 2015. The buyer, with our consent extended the closing date to November 1, 2015 and made a loan to the Company of $900,000, which bears interest at 12% per year and is due and payable on March 6, 2016. The buyer failed to close the purchase on November 1, 2015 and the purchase agreement with the buyer was terminated. The land will continue to be held for sale. 

Beginning September 21, 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Wellness Group Pharms LLC (&#8220;WGP&#8217;), an entity that was pursuing licenses to operate marijuana cultivation facilities under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act. As amended on February 22, 2015, these agreements provided for the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

We were to replace WGP as the purchasing party under an existing contract to acquire a 16.1 acre parcel in Anna, Illinois as WGP was to take the necessary legal steps to assign the right to acquire ownership to the property starting February 23, 2015. Subsequent to the amendment WGP purchased the land. To date we have not received title to the land. 

&#9679; 

We were to construct on this parcel a marijuana cultivation facility (consisting of a 27,000 square foot warehouse and a total developable footprint of 285,000 square feet which would be built in future phases according to demand) in accordance with terms specified in WGP&#8217;s license application with the State of Illinois within six months of the award of the licenses on February 2, 2015. As of September 30, 2015, payments of $332,357 had been made. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

WGP was to lease and operate the facility from us at a base monthly rent of $6.00 per square foot plus 25% of gross monthly sales of cannabis and 20% of gross monthly sales of cannabis infused products. The term of the lease contract was 12 years commencing from the month in which both a final and enforceable occupancy certificate is issued for the facility, and WGP has been granted approval by the State of Illinois to commence production operations in the facility. 

&#9679; 

We were to provide working capital advances up to a maximum borrowing amount of $2,772,724, with such advances accruing interest at a rate of 18% per annum. No principal or interest payments were due until WGP had cash on hand of $250,000, but in any event all principal and interest is due December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2015, advances of $673,294 had been made. 

&#9679; 

We were to receive consulting fees of $20,000 per month, with such unpaid amounts accruing interest at a rate of 18% per annum.beginning on March 1, 2015 through the term of the 12 year lease. As of September 30, 2015, $40,000 had been earned and recognized. 

Between February 2015 and April 2015, both parties operated under this agreement. We made working capital advances totaling $673,294 (inclusive of the deposit of $100,000 made under the Initial WGP Agreements) and we recognized consulting revenues of $40,000. We also incurred construction costs totaling $332,357 to begin developing the facility in connection with its obligations under the amended agreement. However, WGP did not assign its rights to acquire the 16.1 acre parcel to us as required under the amended agreement. Instead, WGP acquired the property directly. We have notified WGP that we have fulfilled our obligations pursuant to our agreements with WGP but due to WGP's breach of contract, and repeated lack of good faith and fair dealing, the agreement was terminated. WGP has claimed that our construction costs were unauthorized. The Company disputes WGP&#8217;s claim. To date, there is no change in the dispute with WGP. 

&#160;

Included in Note and Accounts Receivable &#8211; WGP in our balance sheet at September 30, 2015 are working capital advances of $673,294, accrued consulting fees of $40,000, construction advances of $332,357 and accrued interest of $75,619 for a total of $1,121,270. In addition, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $456,470 has been recognized. 

&#160;

We have a formal security agreement covering $600,000 of the advances made to WGP (and related interest), whereby the indebtedness is secured by all real and personal property of WGP. We believe all other amounts owed by WGP are due and payable and that additional security interests are implied in the agreements. However, given the current dispute with WGP, we have established a provision for doubtful accounts of $456,470 during 2015, representing all amounts owed by WGP (including related interest) that are not covered by a formal security agreement. This provision is reflected as a separate component of operating expense within our accompanying statement of operations. 

We have not filed any formal litigation but have provided legal notice that our loans to WGP are immediately due and payable. By contract, our process for resolving any disputes with WGP is to be resolved via binding arbitration. We are aggressively pursuing collection of all amounts owed by WGP. See &#8220;Note 3: Notes Receivable&#8221; in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding our ongoing dispute with WGP. 

&#160; 

On January 14, 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 52.6 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The property is located approximately 47 miles southeast of Boston. We plan to develop the property as the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center "MMCC". Plans for the MMCC may include the construction of sustainable greenhouse cultivation and processing facilities that will be leased or sold to Registered Marijuana Dispensaries under the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Program. Additional plans for the MMCC may include a testing laboratory, a research facility, a training center, an infused product production facility and corporate offices. We paid the seller $100,000 upon the signing of the agreement which amount will be applied toward the purchase price of $4,000,000 at the closing. On May 6, 2015, to address site considerations before finalizing the planned development, the agreement was amended to extend the closing date to September 1, 2015. On August 27th, 2015 after addressing the site considerations, the agreement was amended to extend the closing date to October 30, 2015 to provide additional time for permitting with a payment of $100,000. 

On October 23, 2015, we made an additional payment to the seller of $100,000, which will be applied to the purchase price if the closing occurs. 

On December 8, 2015, The Town of Freetown Planning Board unanimously approved our site plan application for the MMCC. The site plan application requested 977,000 square feet of infrastructure for medical marijuana cultivation, processing, testing and associated administration in Freetown's Industrial Park. Our ability to proceed with the development of the MMCC is contingent upon the approvals by the Department of Public Health (the &#8220;DPH Approval&#8221;) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of our consulting agreement, development agreement and lease agreement relating to the MMCC. 

On December 22, 2015 we and the seller amended the agreement to extend the closing date to the earlier of 5 business days following our receipt of the DPH Approval, or February 29, 2016. &#160; As consideration for the extension of the closing d ate, we agreed to increase the purchase price for the property to $4,100,000 and paid the seller a non-refundable fee of $100,000 which will be applied to the purchase price if the closing occurs.

Market Conditions 

&#160; 

The market research firm ArcView Group estimates the market for the regulated cannabis industry for 2013 was $1.53 billion, for 2014 was $2.4 billion and is expected to grow to $10 billion by 2018. Based on the ArcView analysis, the cannabis industry is projected to grow faster than any other industry in the country over the next decade. 

While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces three major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital that is necessary to build the infrastructure to meet growing demand. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there will be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. T hird, the cultivation, sale and possession of marijuana is illegal under federal law. 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. 

&#160; 

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as &#8220;the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.&#8221; If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2015, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use by adults. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. However, there is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of such federal laws. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government&#8217;s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Currently, there are a number of other companies that are involved in the marijuana industry, many of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these companies provide services similar to those which we provide or plan to provide. We expect that other companies will recognize the value of serving the marijuana industry and become our competitors. 

General 

&#160; 

Our offices are located at 3200 Brighton Blvd., Unit 144 Denver, CO 80216. The Company leased its office space located at 3200 Brighton Boulevard, Denver, Colorado for $2,870 per month commencing June 18, 2014 and ending June 30, 2015. After June 30, 2015 the lease is month-to-month until the Company gives its 30 day notice to terminate the lease. 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2015 we had two employees, that being Timothy Keogh, our Chief Executive Officer and Jane Roach, our Office Manager. As of September 30, 2015, Mr. Keogh was spending approximately 90% of his time on our business and Jane Roach was spending approximately 100% of her time on the business. See Item 11. Ben Barton is the Company&#8217;s CFO and he plans to spend 80% of his time on the Company&#8217;s business, but does not currently draw a salary.
