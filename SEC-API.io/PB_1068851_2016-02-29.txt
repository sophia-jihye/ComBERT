 ITEM 1. BUSINESS General 

Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. &#174; , a Texas corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), was formed in 1983 as a vehicle to acquire the former Allied Bank in Edna, Texas, which was chartered in 1949 as The First National Bank of Edna and is now known as Prosperity Bank. The Company is a registered financial holding company that derives substantially all of its revenues and income from the operation of its bank subsidiary, Prosperity Bank &#174; (&#147;Prosperity Bank &#174; &#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;). The Bank provides a wide array of financial products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank operated 241 full service banking locations; 60 in the Houston area, including The Woodlands; 30 in the South Texas area, including Corpus Christi and Victoria; 36 in the Dallas/Fort Worth area; 22 in the East Texas area; 29 in the Central Texas area, including Austin and San Antonio; 34 in the West Texas area, including Lubbock, Midland-Odessa and Abilene; 16 in the Bryan/College Station area, 6 in the Central Oklahoma area and 8 in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. The Company&#146;s principal executive office is located at Prosperity Bank Plaza, 4295 San Felipe in Houston, Texas and its telephone number is (713) 693-9300. The Company&#146;s website address is www.prosperitybankusa.com . 

The Company&#146;s market consists of the communities served by its banking centers. The diverse nature of the economies in each local market served by the Company provides the Company with a varied customer base and allows the Company to spread its lending risk throughout a number of different industries including professional service firms and their principals, manufacturing, tourism, recreation, petrochemicals, farming and ranching. The Company&#146;s market areas outside of Houston, Dallas, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Lubbock, Austin, Tulsa and Oklahoma City are dominated by either small community banks or branches of larger regional banks. Management believes that the Company, through its responsive customer service and community banking philosophy, combined with the sophistication of a larger regional bank holding company, has a competitive advantage in its market areas and excellent growth opportunities through acquisitions, new banking center locations and additional business development. 

Operating under a community banking philosophy, the Company seeks to develop broad customer relationships based on service and convenience while maintaining its conservative approach to lending and sound asset quality. The Company has grown through a combination of internal growth, the acquisition of community banks and branches of banks and the opening of new banking centers. Utilizing a low cost of funds and employing stringent cost controls, the Company has been profitable in every year of its existence, including the periods of adverse economic conditions in Texas. 

&#160;

In addition to internal growth, the Company completed the following acquisitions within the last ten years (through December 31, 2015):

Recent Acquisitions 

Acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc. &#151; On January 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Tradition Bancshares, Inc. (&#147;Tradition&#148;) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Tradition Bank headquartered in Houston, Texas. Tradition Bank operated 7 banking offices in the Houston, Texas area, including its main office in Bellaire, 3 banking centers in Katy and 1 banking center in The Woodlands. 

As of December 31, 2015, Tradition, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $548.0 million, total loans of $253.3 million, total deposits of $488.9 million and shareholders&#146; equity of $43.1 million. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the Company issued 679,528 shares of Company common stock plus $39.0 million in cash for all outstanding shares of Tradition capital stock, for a total merger consideration of $71.5 million, based on the Company&#146;s closing stock price of $47.86. On the effective date, the Company recognized preliminary goodwill of $27.5 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed compared with the fair value of the assets acquired. The Company is currently in the process of obtaining fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities and, therefore, the estimates are preliminary.

Information contained on the Company&#146;s website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not part of this or any other report. 

Officers and Associates 

The Company&#146;s directors and officers are important to the Company&#146;s success and play a key role in the Company&#146;s business development efforts by actively participating in civic and public service activities in the communities served by the Company. 

The Company has invested heavily in its officers and associates by recruiting talented officers in its market areas and providing them with economic incentives in the form of stock-based compensation and bonuses based on cross-selling performance. The senior management team has substantial experience in the Houston, Dallas, Austin, Bryan/College Station, East Texas, South Texas, West Texas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa markets and the surrounding communities in which the Company has a presence. Each banking center location is overseen by a local president or manager with knowledge of the community and lending expertise in the specific industries found in the community. The Company entrusts its banking center presidents and managers with authority and flexibility within general parameters with respect to product pricing and decision making in order to minimize the bureaucratic structure of larger banks. The Company operates each banking center as a separate profit center, maintaining separate data with respect to each banking center&#146;s net interest income, efficiency ratio, deposit growth, loan growth and overall profitability. Banking center presidents and managers are accountable for performance in these areas and compensated accordingly. Each banking center has its own listed local business telephone number. Customers are served by a local banker with decision making authority. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank had 3,037 full-time equivalent associates, 859 of whom were officers of the Bank. The Company provides medical and hospitalization insurance to its full-time associates. The Company considers its relations with associates to be good. Neither the Company nor the Bank is a party to any collective bargaining agreement. 

Banking Activities 

The Company, through the Bank, offers a variety of traditional loan and deposit products to its customers, which consist primarily of consumers and small and medium-sized businesses. The Bank tailors its products to the specific needs of customers in a given market. At December 31, 2015, the Bank maintained approximately 594,300 separate deposit accounts including certificates of deposit and 55,600 separate loan accounts. At December 31, 2015, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were 29.1% of the Bank&#146;s total deposits. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s average cost of funds was 0.22% and the Company&#146;s average cost of deposits (excluding all borrowings) was 0.21%. 

The Company has been an active real estate lender, with commercial real estate and 1-4 family residential loans comprising 33.2% and 25.0%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s total loans as of December 31, 2015. The Company also offers commercial loans, loans for automobiles and other consumer durables, home equity loans, debit and credit cards, internet banking and other cash management services, mobile banking, trust and wealth management, retail brokerage services, mortgage banking services and automated telephone banking. The Company offers businesses a broad array of loan products including term loans, lines of credit and loans for working capital, business expansion and the purchase of equipment and machinery; land development and 

&#160;

interim construction loans for builders; and owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. 

By offering certificates of deposit, interest checking accounts, savings accounts and overdraft protection at competitive rates, the Company gives its depositors a full range of traditional deposit products. 

The Company also maintains a trust department with $1.50 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. The trust department provides trust services in the Company&#146;s various market areas. 

Business Strategies 

The Company&#146;s main objective is to increase deposits and loans through internal growth, as well as through acquisition opportunities, while maintaining efficiency, individualized customer service and maximizing profitability. To achieve this objective, the Company has employed the following strategic goals: 

Continue Community Banking Emphasis . Although the Company has significantly grown in the last several years, it intends to continue operating as a community banking organization focused on meeting the specific needs of consumers and small and medium-sized businesses in its market areas. The Company provides a high degree of responsiveness combined with a wide variety of banking products and services. The Company staffs its banking centers with experienced bankers with lending expertise in the specific industries found in the given community, and gives them authority to make certain pricing and credit decisions, avoiding the bureaucratic structure of larger banks. 

Expand Market Share Through Internal Growth and a Disciplined Acquisition Strategy . The Company intends to continue seeking opportunities, both inside and outside its existing markets, to expand either by acquiring existing banks or branches of banks or by establishing new banking centers. All of the Company&#146;s acquisitions have been accretive to earnings within 12 months after acquisition date and generally have supplied the Company with relatively low-cost deposits which have been used to fund the Company&#146;s lending and investing activities. However, the Company makes no guarantee that future acquisitions, if any, will be accretive to earnings within any particular time period. Factors used by the Company to evaluate expansion opportunities include (1) the similarity in management and operating philosophies, (2) whether the acquisition will be accretive to earnings and enhance shareholder value, (3) the ability to improve the efficiency ratio through economies of scale, (4) whether the acquisition will strategically expand the Company&#146;s geographic footprint, and (5) the opportunity to enhance the Company&#146;s market presence in existing market areas. 

Increase Loan Volume and Diversify Loan Portfolio . While maintaining its conservative approach to lending, the Company has emphasized both new and existing loan products, focusing on managing its commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios. From December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s commercial and industrial loans decreased from $1.81 billion to $1.69 billion, or 6.3%, and represented 19.5% and 17.9% of the total portfolio, respectively, for the same period. Commercial real estate (including multifamily residential) increased from $3.03 billion to $3.13 billion, or 3.3%, and represented 32.8% and 33.2% of the total portfolio, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. From December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans) increased from $2.52 billion to $2.64 billion, or 4.7%, and represented 27.3% and 27.9% of the total portfolio, respectively. In addition, the Company targets business owners, professional service firms, including legal and medical practices, for loans secured by owner-occupied premises, working capital or equipment and personal loans to their principals. 

Maintain Sound Asset Quality . The Company continues to maintain the sound asset quality that has been representative of its historical loan portfolio. As the Company continues to diversify and increase its lending activities and acquire loans in acquisitions, it may face higher risks of nonpayment and increased risks in the event of prolonged economic downturns. The Company intends to continue to employ the strict underwriting 

&#160;

guidelines and comprehensive loan review process that have contributed to its low incidence of nonperforming assets and its minimal charge-offs in relation to its size. 

Continue Focus on Efficiency . The Company plans to maintain its stringent cost control practices and policies. The Company has invested significantly in the infrastructure required to centralize many of its critical operations, such as data processing and loan processing. For its banking centers, which the Company operates as independent profit centers, the Company supplies complete support in the areas of loan review, internal audit, compliance and training. Management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate additional growth while enabling the Company to minimize operational costs through economies of scale. 

Enhance Cross-Selling . The Company uses incentives and friendly competition to encourage cross-selling efforts and increase cross-selling results among its associates. Officers and associates have access to each customer&#146;s existing and related account relationships and are better able to inform customers of additional products when customers visit or call the various banking centers or use their drive-in facilities. In addition, the Company includes product information in monthly statements and other mailings. 

Competition 

The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of the Company depends principally on its ability to compete in its market areas. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based nonbank lenders and certain other nonfinancial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than the Company. The Company believes it has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service, technology and responsive decision-making with respect to loans, by establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty and by providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of its customers. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of the bank holding company&#146;s shareholders or creditors. The banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. 

The following description summarizes some of the laws to which the Company and the Bank are subject. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. 

&#160;

The Company 

The Company is a financial holding company pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#147;BHCA&#148;). Accordingly, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;). The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the BHCA and other federal laws subject financial and bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Further, since the Company has securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, it is also subject to the supervision and regulation of these organizations. 

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends . The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company&#146;s revenues is dividends received from the Bank. As described in more detail below, federal law places limitations on the amount that state banks may pay in dividends, which the Bank must adhere to when paying dividends to the Company. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected capital needs and financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company&#146;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to limit or prohibit the payment of dividends if, in the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of a bank holding company&#146;s financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that each bank holding company should carefully review its dividend policy, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, which is the maximum dividend amount that may be issued and allow the company to still maintain its target Tier 1 capital ratio, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

Stress Testing . Pursuant to the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), in October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board published its final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The rules require institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, such as the Company and the Bank, to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by bank regulatory agencies. Beginning with the 2016 stress test, institutions with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion use data as of December 31 st and scenarios released by the agencies. The results of these stress tests must be reported to the agencies by July 31 st of the following year. Public disclosure of summary stress test results under the severely adverse scenario will occur between October 15 th and October 31 st . The Company&#146;s capital ratios reflected in the stress test calculations are an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve Board in evaluating the capital adequacy of the Company and the Bank and determining whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Source of Strength . Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company has historically been required to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including support at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed below, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. 

In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and is required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured 

&#160;

depository institution. Any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims. 

Scope of Permissible Activities . Under the BHCA, bank holding companies generally may not acquire a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company or from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, except that it may engage in, directly or indirectly, certain activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers and permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act defines &#147;financial in nature&#148; to include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company, such as the Company, to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. 

The Company&#146;s financial holding company status depends upon it maintaining its status as &#147;well capitalized&#148; and &#147;well managed&#148; under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, it may not acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of the holding company&#146;s depository institutions and/or its non-bank subsidiaries if the deficiencies persist. 

While the Federal Reserve Board is the &#147;umbrella&#148; regulator for financial holding companies and has the power to examine banking organizations engaged in new activities, regulation and supervision of activities which are financial in nature or determined to be incidental to such financial activities will be handled along functional lines. Accordingly, activities of subsidiaries of a financial holding company will be regulated by the agency or authorities with the most experience regulating that activity as it is conducted in a financial holding company. 

Safe and Sound Banking Practices . Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and 

&#160;

reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues. 

Anti-Tying Restrictions . Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. 

Basel III Capital Adequacy Requirements Effective January 1, 2015 . In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#146;s December 2010 framework known as &#147;Basel III&#148; for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, under the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios and replace the prior risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#146; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions. 

The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (1) introduced a new capital measure called &#147;Common Equity Tier 1&#148; (&#147;CET1&#148;), (2) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148; instruments meeting specified requirements, (3) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/ adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (4) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). Under the capital standards in effect as of December 31, 2014, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, banking organizations that do not have $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure, including the Company and the Bank, are able to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company&#146;s available-for-sale securities portfolio. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, trust preferred securities no longer included in Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies may be included as Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis. 

The Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a new capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, that is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and has the effect of increasing the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a &#147;countercyclical capital buffer&#148; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum (4.5% plus the capital conservation buffer and, if applicable, the 

&#160;

countercyclical capital buffer) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 

The initial minimum capital ratios under the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective as of January 1, 2015 are (1) 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (2) 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, (3) 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets, and (4) 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;). As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#146;s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 13.55%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.55%, Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.25% and Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets was 7.97%. 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (1) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, (3) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5% and (4) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; regulations as discussed below under &#147;The Bank&#151;Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies.&#148; 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the previous four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

The federal banking agencies&#146; risk-based and leverage capital ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

Liquidity Requirements . Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, are now required by regulation. 

One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (&#147;LCR&#148;), is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#146;s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (&#147;NSFR&#148;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will provide banking entities with incentives to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. In September 2014, the federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing (1) the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and (2) a modified version 

&#160;

of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations. Neither rule applies to the Company or the Bank. The federal banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR or addressed the scope of banking organizations to which it will apply. The Basel Committee&#146;s final NSFR document states that the NSFR applies to internationally active banks, as did its final LCR document with respect to that ratio. 

Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries . Bank regulators are required to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary&#146;s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution&#146;s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. 

The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#146;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be &#147;adequately capitalized.&#148; The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes &#147;significantly&#148; or &#147;critically&#148; undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates. 

Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies . The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors. 

Control Acquisitions . The Change in Bank Control Act (&#147;CBCA&#148;) prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring &#147;control&#148; of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Company. 

In addition, a person may not acquire 25% (5% in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company&#146;s or bank&#146;s voting securities, or otherwise obtain control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In 2008, the Federal Reserve Board issued a policy statement on equity investments in bank holding companies and banks, which allows the Federal Reserve Board to generally be able to conclude that an entity&#146;s investment is not &#147;controlling&#148; if the entity does not own in excess of 15% of the voting power and 33% of the total equity of the bank holding company or bank. Depending on the nature of the overall investment and the capital structure of the banking organization, the Federal Reserve Board will permit, based on the policy statement, noncontrolling investments in the form of voting and nonvoting shares that represent in the aggregate (1) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (2) less than 15% of any class of voting securities of the banking organization. 

&#160;

The Volcker Rule . The Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds. Since neither the Company nor the Bank engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on the operations of the Company or the Bank. 

The Bank 

The Bank is a Texas-chartered banking association, the deposits of which are insured by the DIF of the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; therefore, the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Such supervision and regulation subject the Bank to special restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and periodic examination by the FDIC and the Texas Department of Banking. Because the Federal Reserve Board regulates the Company, the Federal Reserve Board also has supervisory authority which affects the Bank. Further, because the Bank had total assets of over $10 billion as of December 31, 2015, the Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;). The CFPB is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. 

Equivalence to National Bank Powers . The Texas Constitution, as amended in 1986, provides that a Texas-chartered bank has the same rights and privileges that are or may be granted to national banks domiciled in Texas. To the extent that the Texas laws and regulations may have allowed state-chartered banks to engage in a broader range of activities than national banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#147;FDICIA&#148;) has operated to limit this authority. FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the DIF. In general, statutory restrictions on the activities of banks are aimed at protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions. 

Financial Modernization . Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a national bank may establish a financial subsidiary and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating of satisfactory or better. Subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries. In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better. 

Although the powers of state chartered banks are not specifically addressed in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Texas-chartered banks such as the Bank, will have the same if not greater powers as national banks through the parity provision contained in the Texas Constitution. 

Branching . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are permitted to engage in de novo interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new branch is to be established would permit the establishment of the branch if it were chartered by such state, subject to applicable regulatory review and approval requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also created certain regulatory requirements for interstate mergers and acquisitions, including that the acquiring bank must be well capitalized and well managed.Texas law provides that a Texas-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Texas provided that the branch is approved in advance by the Texas Department of Banking. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. 

&#160;

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders . Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking affiliates, including the Company, are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of such transactions to 10% of the Bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus and requires that such transactions be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. 

Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons. The Federal Reserve Board has also issued Regulation W which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. 

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as &#147;insiders&#148;) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. 

Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets . Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of the Company&#146;s operating funds and for the foreseeable future it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to the Company will continue to be the Company&#146;s principal source of operating funds. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank will be &#147;undercapitalized.&#148; The FDIC may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even though the Bank would continue to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors. In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as the Company) or any shareholder or creditor thereof. 

Consumer Financial Protection . The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws&#146; respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank&#146;s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys&#146; fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which the Bank operates and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in the Bank&#146;s failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater. The CFPB focuses its supervision and regulatory efforts on (1) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; (2) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; (3) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; (4) certain depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and (5) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. 

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#147;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#148; acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer&#146;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#146;s (1) lack of financial savvy, (2) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (3) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#146;s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates. 

Examinations . The FDIC periodically examines and evaluates state non-member banks. The Texas Department of Banking also conducts examinations of state banks, but may accept the results of a federal examination in lieu of conducting an independent examination. In addition, the FDIC and Texas Department of Banking may elect to conduct a joint examination. Further, because the Bank has total assets of over $10 billion as of December 31, 2015, the CFPB has examination authority with respect to the Bank&#146;s compliance with federal consumer protection laws. Compliance with consumer protection laws will be considered when banking regulators are asked to approve a proposed transaction. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements . The FDIC has adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of insured institutions. The FDIC may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. 

The FDIC&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines generally require state banks to have a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. The capital categories have the same definitions for the Bank as for the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets was 13.10%, Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets was 13.10% and its ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets was 13.80%. 

The FDIC&#146;s leverage guidelines require state banks to maintain Tier 1 capital of no less than 4.0% of average total assets. The Texas Department of Banking has issued a policy which generally requires state chartered banks to maintain a leverage ratio (defined in accordance with federal capital guidelines) of 5.0%. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets (leverage ratio) was 7.70%. 

Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies . The federal banking regulators are required to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are &#147;well-capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;under capitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly under capitalized&#148; and &#147;critically under capitalized.&#148; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A bank is &#147;well capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A bank is &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or higher; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher; and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A bank is &#147;under capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A bank is &#147;significantly under capitalized&#148; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%; a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A bank is &#147;critically under capitalized&#148; if it has tangible equity equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. At December 31, 2015, the Bank was classified as &#147;well-capitalized&#148; for purposes of the FDIC&#146;s prompt corrective action regulations in effect as of such date. 

In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. 

As an institution&#146;s capital decreases, the FDIC&#146;s enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The FDIC has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator. 

Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments . Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits (currently $250,000) by the DIF, and the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance protection. A depository institution&#146;s DIF assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment rate by the assessment base, which is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the depository institution. The initial base assessment rate is based on its capital level and CAMELS ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution&#146;s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and, in some cases, additional discretionary adjustments by the FDIC to reflect additional risk factors. For large institutions, including the Bank, the initial base assessment rate ranges from five to 35 basis points on an annualized basis (basis points representing cents per $100 of assessable assets). After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 2.5 to 45 basis points on an annualized basis. The potential adjustments to an institution&#146;s initial base assessment rate include (i) a potential decrease of up to five basis points for certain long-term unsecured debt except for well-capitalized institutions with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2, and (ii) a potential increase of up to 10 basis points for brokered deposits in excess of 10% of domestic deposits. As the DIF reserve ratio grows, the rate schedule will be adjusted downward. Additionally, an institution must pay a premium equal to 50 basis points on every dollar of long-term, unsecured debt held by the depository institution to the extent that such debt exceeds 3% of an institution&#146;s Tier 1 capital held by that depository institution if such debt was issued by another insured depository institution (excluding debt guaranteed under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program). 

&#160;

The FDIC&#146;s current DIF restoration plan is designed to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. In October 2015, the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule that would enable the FDIC to reach the 1.35% DIF reserve ratio by imposing a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The Bank is monitoring developments with respect to the proposed rule and its potential impact on its deposit insurance assessments. 

Interchange Fees . Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are &#147;reasonable and proportional&#148; to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or &#147;swipe&#148; fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Bank and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 

Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations . The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, which was re-emphasized in December 2015. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. 

Community Reinvestment Act . The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#147;CRA&#148;) and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank&#146;s record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (&#147;FIRREA&#148;) requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank&#146;s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance records of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various 

&#160;

requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation . The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (1) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (2) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Privacy. In addition to expanding the activities in which banks and bank holding companies may engage, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also imposed new requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally prohibits disclosure of customer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of customer privacy than the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 

Incentive Compensation . In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into proposed joint compensation regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies under the Dodd-Frank Act. The regulations have not been finalized, but as proposed, would impose limitations on the manner in which the Bank may structure compensation for its executives. 

The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives 

From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Effect on Economic Environment 

The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. 

Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted.
