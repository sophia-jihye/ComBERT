BUSINESS 

Overview 

Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of targeted oncology products. We focus our development programs on drugs intended to treat specific genetically defined subsets of cancer patients with unmet needs. Our clinical pipeline consists of three product candidates: MGCD265, MGCD516 and mocetinostat. MGCD265 and MGCD516 are orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitors with distinct target profiles that are in development to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC") and other solid tumors. MGCD265 is in Phase 2 clinical development and MGCD516 is in Phase 1b clinical development. Mocetinostat is an orally-bioavailable, Class 1 selective histone deacetylase ("HDAC") inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical development in collaboration with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca PLC. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we", "our", "us", "Mirati" or "the Company" refer to Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

We believe that an increased understanding of the genomic factors that drive tumor cell growth can lead to the development of cancer drugs that target these genomic factors, resulting in increased efficacy while reducing side effects. We are leveraging this knowledge to develop targeted cancer therapies to address unmet needs in selected cancer patient populations. Our novel kinase inhibitors are intended to target specific mutations that drive the growth of cancer or are implicated in cancer drug resistance or pathogenic processes such as tumor angiogenesis. Our HDAC inhibitor, mocetinostat, acts through important epigenetic mechanisms that could have potential when used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to identify additional opportunities by leveraging our deep scientific understanding of molecular drug targets and mechanisms of resistance and potentially in-licensing or internally discovering promising, early-stage novel drug candidates. 

Our three clinical stage product candidates are as follows: 

&#8226; 

MGCD265 is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET and Axl receptor tyrosine kinases, ("RTKs"). MGCD265 is in development for the treatment of solid tumors, with an initial focus on NSCLC but including other solid tumors like those found in gastroesophageal cancers and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ("HNSCC"). In September 2015, we reported interim data from the ongoing MGCD265 Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trials disclosing that two of the four NSCLC patients who were then evaluable (having had at least two on-treatment scans) had confirmed partial responses ("PRs"), based upon Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ("RECIST") criteria and two patients had tumor regressions that did not meet the RECIST threshold for a PR. Based upon these early signs of clinical efficacy we initiated a single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic alternations in MET in December of 2015. Based on a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), in the Phase 2 trial of MGCD265, if we observe a response rate that is significantly better than the response rate for currently approved second line therapy, we believe the trial could potentially serve as a registration enabling trial and qualify for submission for accelerated approval under U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart H (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses). 

We have applied for and received a proposed generic name for MGCD265. The proposed generic name is &#8220;glesatinib.&#8221; The proposed generic name will become final once it is published and a comment period expires, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2016. 

&#8226; 

MGCD516 is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of solid tumors with an emphasis on genetic alterations involving RET, DDR and Trk RTK families as well as CHR4q12 amplicons and CBL inactivating mutations. We plan to focus on solid tumors exhibiting genetic alterations which result in dysregulation of these key drivers of tumor growth, initially in NSCLC. In addition, we plan to evaluate other tumor types where the profile of MGCD516 would suggest clinical benefit. MGCD516 is currently in a Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial which includes cohorts for the treatment of patients with genetic alterations involving the RET, DDR and Trk RTK families as well as CHR4q12 amplicons and CBL inactivating mutations. 

We have applied for and received a proposed generic name for MGCD516. The proposed generic name is &#8220;sitravatinib.&#8221; The proposed generic name will become final once it is published and a comment period expires, which we expect will occur in the first half of 2016. 

&#8226; 

Mocetinostat is an orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective HDAC inhibitor that we plan to evaluate in combination with durvalumab, MedImmune&#8217;s immune checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC. We plan to initiate this trial in the second quarter of 2016. By virtue of its specificity for Class 1 HDACs, mocetinostat showed a favorable effect on the 

immune system in preclinical studies. By increasing PD-L1, certain costimulatory molecules, and HLA antigens on the tumor cells, mocetinostat may enhance the immune response to tumors. Mocetinostat may also have a favorable effect on the immune system by decreasing T regulatory cells ("T-regs") and myeloid derived suppressor cells ("MDSCs"). We believe that, overall, these effects on the immune system have the potential to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. We are in the process of completing Phase 2 clinical trials of mocetinostat in patients with bladder cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome ("MDS") and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma ("NHL"), specifically Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ("DLBCL") and Follicular Lymphoma ("FL"). We have not observed activity or a level of patient responses in these trials that justify moving forward as a single agent and at the present time we do not expect to undertake further single agent trials with mocetinostat. 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2013 as Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. On May 8, 2013, we entered into a plan of arrangement with MethylGene, Inc. ("MethylGene Canada") pursuant to which MethylGene Canada became our wholly owned subsidiary and all of its shareholders became proportionate shareholders of ours. Our website address is www.mirati.com.

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be a leading developer of targeted cancer therapies for genetically selected patient populations. The key components of our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Develop a pipeline of targeted cancer therapies. We believe that an increased understanding of the genomic factors that drive tumor cell growth will lead to the development of cancer drugs with increased efficacy while reducing side effects. We are leveraging the prior successful experience of certain members of our management team in the development and approval of multiple oncology and targeted oncology drugs (e.g. Temodar, Sutent, Inlyta, Xalkori, and Ibrance) to develop targeted cancer therapies to address unmet needs in specific cancer populations. Our clinical pipeline is comprised of two novel kinase inhibitors that target specific mutations that drive cancer cell growth and an HDAC inhibitor which is one of the most advanced epigenetic therapies in development. We plan to identify additional targets by leveraging our deep scientific understanding of molecular drug targets and mechanisms of resistance through internal drug discovery activities or potentially in-licensing promising, early-stage novel drug candidates. 

&#8226; 

Employ efficient and flexible approaches to accelerate clinical development. Based on the prior extensive experience of certain members of our management team in oncology drug development, which includes the successful registration of several products, we take an adaptive approach to our clinical trials so that we use the information from the ongoing trials to increase our likelihood of success. We will pursue indications and select specific patient populations in which activity of our product candidates can be assessed in small proof of concept ("POC") clinical trials potentially leading to accelerated clinical development. When designing clinical trials, we structure our clinical development approach to test multiple clinical hypotheses in a single trial and design trials with the flexibility to adapt quickly and accelerate once a signal of clinical benefit is observed. We believe our approach may increase the likelihood of seeing results early in clinical trials with fewer patients, reducing our clinical development risk and development costs and allowing us to potentially accelerate the development of our product pipeline. 

&#8226; 

Advance our two lead kinase inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors have significantly improved the care of many cancer patients and represent a commercially successful category of targeted cancer therapies with global sales of over $29.1 billion in 2011, according to BCC Research. We have two internally discovered novel kinase inhibitors in development: MGCD265 and MGCD516. These product candidates target pathways of high scientific interest, including MET, Axl, RET, DDR, and Trk RTK families and including exploration of novel genetic alterations including CHR4q12 amplicons and CBL inactivating mutations. These pathways are believed to be drivers of tumor growth and to be responsible for the development of tumor resistance to several anti-cancer treatments. MGCD265 is in Phase 2 development and MGCD516 is currently in a Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial. 

&#8226; 

Advance mocetinostat, our HDAC inhibitor. HDAC inhibitors modulate epigenetic events by their potent inhibition of histone deacetylation. This class of agents has been shown to be effective, as single agents, in treating hematologic malignancies, as evidenced by the approvals of Istodax and Zolinza. A growing body of evidence indicates that Class I HDAC inhibitors like mocetinostat have effects directly on tumor cells as well as on immune cells (T-regs and MDSC) 

that may enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab, pemrolizumab, durvalumab and others. We have completed several clinical trials with mocetinostat in more than 400 patients which have provided valuable information on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile of the drug. We are focused on the development of mocetinostat in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC since we believe that is the most promising indication and will create the greatest benefit for the largest number of patients. We plan to initiate a clinical trial evaluating the combination of mocetinostat and durvalumab in patients with NSCLC in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#8226; 

Leverage partnerships to develop our product candidates. We plan to collaborate with third parties and partner certain rights to our product candidates as a means to accelerate their broader clinical development and maximize their therapeutic and market potential. We plan to retain certain key development and commercialization rights in our partnerships. We believe that retaining this strategic flexibility will enable us to maximize shareholder value. Specifically, we recently entered into collaboration agreements with Foundation Medicine, Inc. and Guardant Health, Inc. to explore development of their platforms as companion diagnostics for MGCD265.

Our Targeted Kinase Programs 

Specific genes or pathways that are inappropriately activated in certain types of cancer cells and not in normal tissue are called driver mutations. Targeted therapies selectively inhibit these mutations. RTKs are a family of kinases involved in the transmission of signals that regulate intercellular processes, including those that control cell growth and cell division. RTKs may be inappropriately activated in cancerous tissues resulting in uncontrolled tumor cell growth. Aberrant kinase function, caused by genetic mutations, gene amplification, or over-expression, underlies many cancer cell processes, making the kinome an important source for therapeutic targets in oncology. Discoveries of specific drivers of disease have led to the development of targeted therapies, or the tailoring of therapies to a particular tumor or disease profile. In some cases, these therapies have proven to be more efficacious while having fewer side effects than traditional non-targeted therapies, such as chemotherapy, which kill healthy cells along with cancer cells. Examples of successful development of oral targeted kinase inhibitors include Novartis AG&#8217;s Gleevec, a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia; and GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Tykerb, a HER2 kinase inhibitor for the treatment of a subset of breast cancer patients over-expressing the HER2 kinase. Further examples of oral targeted kinase inhibitors include Pfizer&#8217;s Xalkori and Bosulif and Bristol-Myers Squibb&#8217;s Sprycel. We believe that therapies targeting specific genetic abnormalities in subsets of cancer patients identified through companion diagnostic tests will result in streamlined clinical trials and improved patient outcomes and will be increasingly important in the continued evolution of the treatment of cancer. 

We believe that by selecting patients whose tumors have genetic mutations and alterations in the pathways that are critical for tumor growth and that may be potently inhibited by our drugs, we will increase the potential for clinical benefit. A greater clinical benefit in selected patients would increase the likelihood of demonstrating clinical benefit earlier in development, potentially in Phase 1, which may allow us to move rapidly into registration trials. As a part of our ongoing development activities, we are using commercial diagnostic assays as well as assays developed internally for early clinical trials. We are working with external diagnostic providers to develop validated companion diagnostics for later stage clinical use and for potential registration to ensure that the diagnostic is widely available for commercial use upon approval. In December of 2015 we announced collaborations with Foundation Medicine, Inc., and Guardant Health, Inc. to explore development of their platforms as companion diagnostics for MGCD265. 

The clinical and commercial success of leading small molecule kinase inhibitors demonstrates the potential of new targeted treatments for cancer. The following table lists retail sales figures for selected small molecule kinase inhibitors.

Our kinase inhibitor programs in clinical development, MGCD265 and MGCD516, are kinase inhibitors with distinct target profiles. These new molecular entities are in development for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and other solid tumors that exhibit the mutations and alterations of interest. MGCD265 and MGCD516 were developed internally and we own all global rights. 

MGCD265 - A Multi-targeted Kinase Inhibitor for Solid Tumors 

MGCD265 Overview 

MGCD265 is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule kinase inhibitor of MET and Axl. MGCD265 is currently in development for the treatment of patients with solid tumors with an initial focus on patients with NSCLC. We are also investigating patients with other solid tumors including gastroesophageal cancers and HNSCC. In late 2014 we established the maximum tolerated dose ("MTD") and initiated dose expansion cohorts in patients selected for specific driver mutations which activate the MET or Axl pathways. This patient selection strategy is designed to potentially result in a high response rate that could enable an accelerated development pathway. In September 2015 we reported interim data from the ongoing MGCD265 Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial, disclosing that two of the four NSCLC patients who were then evaluable (having had at least two on-treatment scans) had confirmed PRs, based upon RECIST criteria and the other two patients had tumor regressions that did not meet the threshold to be considered RECIST PRs. Based upon these early signs of clinical efficacy we initiated a single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic alternations in MET in December of 2015. Based on a meeting with the FDA, if we observe a response rate in the Phase 2 trial of MGCD265 that is significantly better than the response rate for currently approved second line therapy, we believe the trial could potentially serve as a registration enabling trial and qualify for submission for accelerated approval under U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart H (Accelerated Approval of New Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses). 

Our development strategy for MGCD265 is based on our understanding of the compound&#8217;s target inhibition profile and, accordingly, our initial focus for this program will be NSCLC although we intend to also explore other solid tumors where genetic alterations in MET or Axl are also known to be present. We intend to undertake patient selection using a targeted next generation sequencing assay to identify patients with certain genetic mutations or alterations of MET or Axl that result in oncogenic activation and are implicated as drivers of tumor progression. 

MGCD265 Market Overview 

The National Cancer Institute ("NCI") estimates that in 2015, approximately 221,200 patients in the United States were diagnosed with lung cancer and 158,040 died due to the disease. Approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLCs. The potential oncogenic mutations of MET and Axl that we are targeting may exist in up to 8% of NSCLC cases. At present, the prevalence of the genetic alterations of MET and Axl is less well characterized in other solid tumors, however, they are known to occur in other solid tumors and we are exploring those additional indications. Although other tumor types may respond to treatment with MGCD265, NSCLC, HNSCC and gastroesophageal cancers are of particular relevance to demonstrate the clinical activity of MGCD265. Key features of these markets are shown in the table below.

Approximately 15% of NSCLC cases have activating EGFR mutations, equating to 28,203 patients each year in the United States. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target EGFR have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with EGFR mutations, tumors eventually become resistant to therapy. Resistance to EGFR therapy is mediated through mutation and/or overexpression of alternative targets and pathways, including MET and Axl in approximately 70% of resistant tumors, or 19,742 patients annually in the United States. 

MGCD265 Background 

MGCD265 is a small molecule, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits MET and Axl. These targets have been shown to play key roles in tumor development, tumor cell survival, therapeutic resistance and blood vessel formation, or angiogenesis. MGCD265 is selective for these two targets at clinically achievable dose levels and shows minimal activity against a panel of over 300 other kinases. We believe this profile provides the following potential advantages for MGCD265: 

&#8226; 

therapeutic action against specific mutations and genetic alterations of MET; 

&#8226; 

therapeutic action against a novel target ("Axl"); 

&#8226; 

high specificity reduces the risk of side effects from off-target activity; and 

&#8226; 

the selection of specific patients whose tumors exhibit genetic alterations of MET or Axl that may be drivers of tumor growth provides an opportunity to demonstrate single agent clinical responses of MGCD265. 

The MET receptor is a member of the RTK protein family that is found on the cell&#8217;s surface that plays a key role in the growth, survival and metastasis of various types of cancers, when not properly regulated. The MET target has generated significant scientific and pharmaceutical interest because of its direct involvement in tumor cell survival and angiogenesis. MET expression is elevated in several major tumor types including NSCLC, gastric cancer, RCC and HCC and is associated with poor prognosis. MET activation may also be associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva, Iressa and Erbitux. In tumors with EGFR mutation or activation, the activation or genetic alteration of MET is implicated as an escape mechanism leading to EGFR-inhibitor resistance. Inhibition of MET may result in clinical benefit by blocking the MET-driven escape mechanism used by some tumor cells when treated with other targeted inhibitors of the EGFR, such as Tarceva or Iressa. 

Axl is also an RTK, and its expression has been shown to correlate with clinical-stage and lymph node status in NSCLC. Axl can be dysregulated in certain cancers through increased protein expression or gene rearrangement, resulting in abnormal tumor growth and tumor cell survival. Axl has also been linked to resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva and Erbitux. Axl is also expressed in other tumor types and may be a clinically significant driver in RCC, ovarian, pancreatic and other tumors. 

MGCD265 is distinguished from many other small molecule inhibitors of MET due in part to its potent activity against Axl, which provides an opportunity against tumors driven by Axl such as NSCLC tumors that exhibit a translocation of Axl that drives tumor growth, thereby increasing the likelihood that these tumors will respond to MGCD265. Further, MET and Axl are 

both overexpressed and/or genetically altered in tumors that are resistant to EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva, Iressa and Erbitux. It is estimated that MET is overexpressed in approximately half of EGFR-resistant tumors, and amplified in 5-20% of EGFR-resistant tumors. It is estimated that Axl is overexpressed in approximately 20-30% of EGFR-resistant tumors. The simultaneous inhibition of both MET and Axl pathways may be required for clinical efficacy in patients developing resistance to EGFR inhibitors or for the prevention of resistance by combining MGCD265 with an EGFR inhibitor as first line treatment. Finally, in preclinical studies MGCD265 has demonstrated inhibition of tumor cells which express mutant forms of MET that appear to be greater than other known small molecule inhibitors of MET. 

The profile of MGCD265 and our clinical development strategy is clearly distinguished from MET antibody antagonists (such as MetMab) that inhibit the MET pathway signaling primarily by preventing the binding of HGF to MET. The inhibition of the catalytic activity of MET via small molecule strategies like MGCD265, as opposed to inhibition of ligand binding by MET antibody antagonists, is an important differentiated strategy in disease settings in which MET is activated by ligand-independent mechanisms including activating mutations, gene amplification, and/or extreme overexpression. Our primary focus in clinical development is on patients with NSCLC or other solid tumors exhibiting driver mutations in the MET and Axl pathways. These driver mutations result in constitutive activation of the MET or Axl receptors so they become independent of normally tightly regulated growth factor signaling. In the case of MET, genetic alterations can result in the activation of MET-dependent signaling independent of binding to HGF. Therefore, patients with these driver mutations would not be responsive to MET antibody antagonists that inhibit HGF binding, but are more likely to respond to MGCD265, which inhibits signaling irrespective of growth factor binding. If we are able to demonstrate single agent POC in select patients, we also plan to explore the combination of MGCD265 with EGFR inhibitors to treat and/or prevent EGFR resistance. 

MGCD265 Preclinical Development 

Our preclinical studies, in a variety of in vivo tumor models, suggest that MGCD265 is well tolerated at dose levels that inhibit MET and Axl and demonstrates tumor regression in experimental cancer models that exhibit genetic mutations and alterations of interest. 

MGCD265 Clinical Trials 

Multiple Phase 1 clinical trials conducted with MGCD265 show evidence of clinical activity as monotherapy and in combination trials. MGCD265 doses have resulted in exposures consistent with greater than 90% inhibition of MET mutations, MET amplifications and Axl fusions. Dosing is ongoing in the expansion cohorts which are enrolling patients selected for specific genetic mutations and alterations of MET and Axl. 

The original IND for MGCD265 was filed in December 2007 and became effective in January 2008. To date, approximately 300 patients have been exposed to MGCD265 in multiple clinical trials in a variety of solid tumor types. MGCD265 has been generally well tolerated at all doses and schedules tested to date, both as monotherapy and in combination with either Taxotere or Tarceva. 

The most frequent treatment-related adverse events observed were diarrhea, fatigue and nausea. Other than as noted below, all of these trials were conducted with prior formulations of MGCD265 that are no longer actively being developed. In addition, none of those prior trials were conducted in patient populations that were selected for genetic alterations or mutations in MET and Axl that we expect are the most likely to respond to treatment with MGCD265, which is our current development focus. 

The historical MGCD265 clinical trials are set forth in the following table.

The MTD of MGCD265 was established as 1050mg administered orally on a BID continuous schedule. The observed dose limiting toxicities ("DLTs"), included one patient who experienced grade 3 fatigue and one patient that experienced grade 3 diarrhea. Clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and nonclinical projections indicate MGCD265 plasma levels consistent with MET and Axl inhibition that we would expect to result in clinical activity. In the fourth quarter of 2014 we initiated the dose expansion portion of the trial and began enrolling patients selected for target alterations of interest in MET or Axl. In September 2015 we reported an interim update on the ongoing MGCD265 Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial, disclosing that two of the four NSCLC patients who were then evaluable (having had at least two on-treatment scans) had confirmed PRs based upon RECIST criteria and the other two patients had tumor regressions that did not meet the threshold to be considered RECIST PRs. Based upon these early signs of clinical efficacy, we initiated a single-arm Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of NSCLC patients with genetic alternations in MET in December of 2015. 

MGCD265 Developmental Initiatives and Objectives 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a single agent Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with genetic alterations of MET in NSCLC. Our initial focus for this program is NSCLC. We are also exploring other solid tumors that also have the genetic mutations and alterations of interest. 

We believe that by selecting patients whose tumors have genetic mutations and alterations that are implicated as oncogenic drivers and that are potently inhibited by MGCD265 we may increase the likelihood of seeing clinical activity earlier in clinical development. We are using commercially available diagnostic assays as well as assays developed internally for early clinical use. We are developing companion diagnostics in collaboration with diagnostic platform providers including Foundation Medicine, Inc. and Guardant Health, that we plan to use in the current Phase 2 trial, later stage trials and commercialization, if approved. 

MGCD516 - A Novel Multi-targeted Kinase Inhibitor for Solid Tumors 

MGCD516 is an orally-bioavailable, potent, small molecule multi-targeted kinase inhibitor. MGCD516 is a potent inhibitor of closely related RTKs including the RET, DDR and Trk kinase families. We plan to focus our initial development efforts on solid tumors in which genetic mutations and alterations of RET, DDR and Trk families are implicated as oncogenic drivers with an initial focus on NSCLC. We are also exploring novel patient selection strategies including patients with CHR4q12 amplicons and CBL inactivating mutations that may be treatable with MGCD516. Genetic alterations in RET, DDR and Trk account for up to 4% of NSCLC cases patients annually in the U.S. and alterations in CHR4q12 and CBL occur in up to 6% of NSCLC cases. We also plan to evaluate other tumor types for which the RTK targets of MGCD516 may suggest activity. We recently established the maximum tolerated dose of MGCD516 as 150mg administered once a day, orally on a continuous schedule. We opened the Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial in December of 2015 and are currently treating selected patients. 

MGCD516 has demonstrated oral bioavailability in preclinical studies, inhibited target-dependent tumor cell growth and survival, and demonstrated broad spectrum antitumor activity in preclinical cancer models including tumor regression in tumor models exhibiting genetic alteration of MGCD516 RTK targets. 

Mocetinostat - A Spectrum-Selective Oral HDAC Inhibitor 

Mocetinostat Overview 

Mocetinostat is an orally-bioavailable, spectrum-selective HDAC inhibitor that we plan to evaluate in combination with checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. By virtue of its specificity for Class 1 HDACs, mocetinostat showed a favorable effect on the immune system in preclinical studies. By increasing PD-L1, costimulatory molecules, and HLA antigens on tumor cells, we believe that mocetinostat may enhance the immune response to tumors. Mocetinostat may also have a favorable effect on the immune system by decreasing T-regs and MDSC. We believe that, overall, these effects on the immune system have the potential to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. We have established an agreement with MedImmune to evaluate their PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in combination with mocetinostat in patients with NSCLC as one of our initial trials to demonstrate the ability of mocetinostat to enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition. 

&#32;&#32;The epigenetic mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in hematologic malignancies and have been approved as single agents. In addition, HDAC inhibition by agents like mocetinostat may be complementary with other epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics is the regulation of gene expression and resulting cellular phenotypes through mechanisms other than primary DNA sequence alterations. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves the regulation of DNA methylation and modification of certain histones via modulation of acetylation or methylation of specific amino acid residues. Epigenetic pathways can become dysregulated during cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms, including the genetic alteration of molecules that participate in DNA methylation and histone modification. 

Mocetinostat Market Overview 

The potential of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of certain cancers has been validated by the approval of Zolinza and Istodax for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma. 

Our current focus for mocetinostat is on the treatment of patients with NSCLC in combination with durvalumab, MedImmune&#8217;s immune checkpoint inhibitor. We believe that the combination has the potential to address all patients with NSCLC. In the United States alone, the estimated annual incidence of NSCLC is approximately 220,000. 

Mocetinostat Background 

Histones are protein components of the structural architecture of DNA known as chromatin (chromatin is the material that chromosomes are made of, and is comprised of DNA and histone proteins). Local gene expression activity can be controlled through epigenetic mechanisms by inducing changes in chromatin conformation through chemical modifications of histones. Acetylated histones are associated with a more open configuration of chromatin that is receptive to gene expression signals. In contrast, decreases in histone acetylation result in a more compact structure where gene expression is restricted or suppressed. Tumor suppressor genes serve to regulate cell growth and cell death, but during oncogenesis these tumor suppressor genes may become silenced due to HDAC-dependent decreases in histone acetylation leading to unrestricted growth of tumor cells. HDACs are a family of 11 enzymes (the individual HDAC enzymes are referred to as isoforms) that appear to act as a master regulator of the expression of genes. HDAC inhibitors modulate inappropriate deacetylation of histones to restore normal acetylation patterns as well as tumor suppressor gene expression. Inhibition of HDACs may result in multiple anti-cancer effects such as (1) the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, (2) the induction of apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells, (3) improved cell cycle regulation, (4) the induction of tumor suppressor genes, and (5) re-establishing normal histone acetylation activity in cells where mutations or alterations may cause a loss of normal function. 

We believe that a key differentiating feature of mocetinostat is its spectrum of activity, targeting HDAC isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 11 which area categorized as Class I (1,2,3) and Class IV (11) HDACs. We believe that these isoforms, and particularly isoforms 1 and 2, are the most relevant HDAC isoforms in cancer therapy and are also the isoforms most potently inhibited by mocetinostat. Compared to other HDAC inhibitors that have a broader spectrum of activity, the profile of mocetinostat may allow us to inhibit the targets relevant to cancer more potently and thereby potentially demonstrate improved clinical efficacy and reduced side effects. Furthermore, the selectivity of mocetinostat for Class I HDACs and the lack of activity against Class II HDACs may have complimentary effects on tumor cells and the immune system that would enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors and potentially expand the utility of checkpoint inhibition to the majority of patients with solid tumors who fail to respond to single agent checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 

Mocetinostat Clinical Development 

The first IND for mocetinostat was submitted in December 2003 and became effective in January 2004. Our current focus for mocetinostat is on the treatment of patients with NSCLC in combination with durvalumab. We plan to initiate a clinical trial evaluating this combination approach in patients with NSCLC in the second quarter of 2016. 

To date, we have evaluated mocetinostat as a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents in more than 400 patients in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials with various malignancies, including MDS, HL, NHL (including DLBCL or FL), acute myeloid leukemia ("AML"), chronic lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as advanced solid tumors. Through these trials, the safety and tolerability of mocetinostat as a single agent and in combination has been well characterized. The clinical trials showed activity as a single agent in HL and NHL and in combination with Vidaza in MDS and AML. 

We have completed several clinical trials with mocetinostat which enrolled more than 400 patients with a variety of advanced malignancies. We are in the process of completing Phase 2 trials in bladder cancer and NHL. In both the bladder cancer and NHL Phase 2 clinical trials patients were selected for inactivating mutations in two histone acetyl transferase genes (CREBBP and EP300) ("HATs"), using a next generation sequencing assay. Preclinical studies have shown that tumor cells carrying these HAT inactivating mutations are more sensitive to mocetinostat. To date we have not seen a level of activity or response to single agent mocetinostat that justifies continuing development in those indications. As a result, at the present time we do not expect to undertake further clinical trials with mocetinostat as a single agent in bladder cancer, NHL or MDS. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and Proprietary Technology 

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our practice is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, intellectual property protection for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of patents, protection of proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and contractual arrangements, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we seek to put in place appropriate internal policies for the management of confidential information, and require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and which require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 

We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2015 , we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including 28 issued U.S. patents as reflected in the following table:

Competition 

Competitors in Oncology - Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors 

A large number of kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, with many more in the early research stage. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are also developing monoclonal antibodies to kinase targets and their ligands. 

Our MGCD265 program is characterized by potential advantages including: a unique kinase spectrum including the emerging RTK target Axl; potent inhibition of MET driver mutations which are not inhibited by other small molecule inhibitors due to a different mode of binding to the MET molecule; a lack of activity against over 300 off-target kinases, supporting a favorable safety profile; and excellent tolerability to date in combination with other anti-cancer agents (including chemotherapy), thus optimizing the potential for combination therapy approaches. 

Companies with MET inhibitors believed to be in late preclinical or clinical development include, but are not limited to: AbbVie, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Exelixis Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Ignyta, Inc., Incyte Corporation, Merck KGaA, NantPharma LLC, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., and Sanofi S. A. 

Companies with Axl inhibitors in clinical development include, but are not limited to, Astellas Pharma Inc., BergenBio AS, Exelixis, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Tolero, Inc. 

Competitors in Oncology - HDAC 

We believe that a key differentiating feature of mocetinostat is its spectrum of activity covering only isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 11, which are the most relevant HDAC isoforms in human cancers. Other companies that are developing spectrum-selective HDAC 

inhibitors include, but are not limited to, Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chroma Therapeutics Ltd., Huya Bioscience International, Shenzen Chipscreen Biosciences Ltd. and Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

Companies with Pan-HDAC inhibitors, which are HDAC inhibitors that have an effect across a broader range of HDAC isoforms and are therefore not as selective as molecules like mocetinostat, include but are not limited to: Celgene Corporation, Curis Inc., MEI Pharma Inc., Merck &#38; Co Inc., Novartis, Pharmacyclics Inc. and others. We expect that these and other companies may continue to pursue research and development in relation to HDAC inhibitors. We continue to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our products. 

Competitors in Oncology - General 

In addition to companies that have HDAC inhibitors or kinase inhibitors addressing oncology indications, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, including, but not limited to, Gilead Sciences Inc. and specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer-Schering Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Taiho and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. 

Many companies have filed, and continue to file, patent applications which may or could affect our program if and when they issue, either because they protect a product that may compete with our product candidates, or because they protect intellectual property rights that are necessary for us to develop and commercialize our product candidates. These companies include, but are not limited to: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Compugen Limited, Exelixis, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Pfizer. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, we expect that these and other companies will continue to publish and file patent applications in this space in the future, as well as pursuing research and development programs in this area. We continue to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our product candidates. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 47 employees located in our offices in San Diego. We also utilize the services of consultants on a regular basis. 30 employees are engaged in product development activities and 17 are in support administration, including business development.
