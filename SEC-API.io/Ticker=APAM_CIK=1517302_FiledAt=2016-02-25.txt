 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Founded in 1994, we are an investment management firm that provides a broad range of U.S., non-U.S. and global investment strategies, each of which is managed by one of our seven distinct and autonomous investment teams. Since our founding, we have pursued a business model that is designed to maximize our ability to produce attractive investment results for our clients, and we believe this model has contributed to our success in doing so. We focus on attracting, retaining and developing talented investment professionals by creating an environment in which each investment team is provided ample resources and support, transparent and direct financial incentives, and a high degree of investment autonomy. Each of our investment teams is led by one or more experienced portfolio managers with a track record of strong investment performance and is devoted to identifying long-term investment opportunities. We believe this autonomous structure promotes independent analysis and accountability among our investment professionals, which we believe promotes superior investment results. 

The following table sets forth our revenues and our ending and average assets under management for the periods noted:

Each of our investment strategies is designed to have a clearly articulated, consistent and replicable investment process that is well-understood by clients and managed to achieve long-term performance. Throughout our history, we have expanded our investment management capabilities in a disciplined manner that we believe is consistent with our overall philosophy of offering high value-added investment strategies in growing asset classes. We have expanded the range of strategies that we offer by launching new strategies managed by our existing investment teams as those teams have developed investment capacity, such as our Global Small-Cap Growth strategy, which we launched in June 2013, as well as by launching new strategies managed by new investment teams recruited to join Artisan. During 2014, we established the Artisan Credit Team, which manages the Artisan High Income strategy, our first fixed income strategy. During 2015, we established the Artisan Developing World Team, which manages the Artisan Developing World strategy. 

We launch a new strategy only when we believe it has the potential to achieve superior investment performance in an area that we believe will have sustained client demand at attractive fee rates over the long term. We strive to maintain the integrity of the investment process followed in each of our strategies by rigorous adherence to the investment parameters we have communicated to our clients. We also carefully monitor our investment capacity in each investment strategy. We believe that management of our investment capacity protects our ability to manage assets successfully, which protects the interests of our clients and, in the long term, protects our ability to retain client assets and maintain our profit margins. In order to better achieve our long-term goals, we are willing to close a strategy to new investors or otherwise take action to slow or restrict its growth, even though our short-term results may be impacted. 

In addition to our investment teams, we have a management team that is focused on our business objectives of achieving profitable growth, expanding our investment capabilities, diversifying the source of our assets under management and delivering superior client service. Our management team supports our investment management capabilities and manages a centralized infrastructure, which allows our investment professionals to focus primarily on making investment decisions and generating returns for our clients. 

We offer our investment management capabilities primarily to institutions and through intermediaries that operate with institutional-like decision-making processes and have longer-term investment horizons, by means of separate accounts and mutual funds. As of December 31, 2015 , separate accounts represented $46.3 billion , or 46% , of our assets under management. 

We serve as the investment adviser to Artisan Partners Funds, Inc., an SEC-registered family of mutual funds that offers shares in multiple classes designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors, and as investment manager of Artisan Partners Global Funds PLC, a family of Ireland-based UCITS funds that began operations in 2011 and offers shares to non-U.S. investors. Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds comprised $53.5 billion , or 54% , of our assets under management as of December 31, 2015 . 

We access traditional institutional clients primarily through relationships with investment consultants. We access other institutional-like investors primarily through consultants, alliances with major defined contribution/401(k) platforms and relationships with financial advisors and broker-dealers. We derive essentially all of our revenues from investment management fees, which primarily are based on a specified percentage of clients&#8217; average assets under management. These fees are derived from investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements that are terminable by clients upon short notice or no notice. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 370 employees. Our employees, including our investment professionals and senior management, to whom we have granted equity collectively owned approximately 29% of the equity ownership interests in our company, based on Class B common stock and unvested restricted shares held by employees as of December 31, 2015 . 

Investment Teams 

We provide clients with multiple long-only, equity investment strategies spanning market capitalization segments and investing styles in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. We also offer one fixed income strategy, the Artisan High Income strategy. Each strategy is managed by one of the investment teams described below. Each team operates autonomously to identify investment opportunities in order to generate strong, long-term investment performance. 

The table below sets forth the total assets under management for each of our investment teams and strategies as of December 31, 2015 , the inception date for each investment composite, the value-added by each strategy since inception date, and the Overall Morningstar Rating&#8482; for the series of Artisan Funds managed in that strategy.

(1) Value-added since inception date is the amount in basis points by which the average annual gross composite return of each of our strategies has outperformed the broad-based market index most commonly used by our clients to compare the performance of the relevant strategy since its inception date. Periods of one year or less are not annualized. The broad-based market indices used to compute the value added since inception date for each of our strategies are as follows: Non-U.S. Growth strategy-MSCI EAFE&#174; Index; Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy-MSCI EAFE&#174; Small Cap Index; Global Equity strategy-MSCI ACWI&#174; Index; Global Small-Cap Growth strategy-MSCI ACWI&#174; Small Cap Index; U.S. Small-Cap Value strategy-Russell 2000&#174; Index; U.S. Mid-Cap Value strategy-Russell Midcap&#174; Index; Value Equity strategy-Russell 1000&#174; Index; U.S. Mid-Cap Growth strategy-Russell Midcap&#174; Index; Global Opportunities strategy-MSCI ACWI&#174; Index; U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy-Russell 2000&#174; Index; Non-U.S. Value strategy-MSCI EAFE&#174; Index; Global Value strategy-MSCI ACWI&#174; Index; Emerging Markets strategy-MSCI Emerging Markets IndexSM; Developing World Strategy-MSCI Emerging Markets Index; High Income strategy&#8212;Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index. Unlike the BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield Master ll Index, the Artisan High Income strategy may hold loans and other security types. At times, this does cause material differences in relative performance. 

(2) The Morningstar Rating&#8482; compares the risk-adjusted performance of the Artisan Funds series to other funds in a category assigned by Morningstar based on its analysis of the funds&#8217; portfolio holdings. The top 10% of funds receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating&#8482; is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with the rated fund&#8217;s three-, five- and 10-year Morningstar Rating metrics. The Artisan Funds, the ratings of which are reflected in the table above, and the categories in which they are rated are: Artisan International Fund-Foreign Large Blend Funds Category; Artisan International Small Cap Fund-Foreign Small/Mid Growth Funds Category; Artisan Global Equity Fund-World Stock; Artisan Small Cap Value Fund-Small Value Funds Category; Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund-Mid Cap Value Funds Category; Artisan Value Equity Fund-Large Value Funds Category; Artisan Mid Cap Fund-Mid Cap Growth Funds Category; Artisan Global Opportunities Fund-World Stock; Artisan Small Cap Fund-Small Growth Funds Category; Artisan International Value Fund-Foreign Small/Mid Funds Category; Artisan Global Value Fund-World Stock; Artisan Emerging Markets Fund-Diversified Emerging Markets Funds Category. Morningstar ratings are initially given on a fund&#8217;s three-year track record and change monthly. 

Global Equity Team 

Our Global Equity team, which was formed in 1996 and is based in San Francisco and New York, manages four investment strategies: Non-U.S. Growth, Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth, Global Equity and Global Small-Cap Growth. Mark L. Yockey is the founder of our Global Equity team and has been portfolio manager of each of the team&#8217;s strategies since their inception. Charles-Henri Hamker and Andrew J. Euretig are associate portfolio managers of the Non-U.S. Growth strategy and portfolio co-managers (with Mr. Yockey) of the Global Equity strategy. Mr. Hamker also serves as portfolio manager of the Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth and Global Small-Cap Growth strategies with Mr. Yockey. The Non-U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy is closed to most new investors and client relationships. We closed the Non-U.S. Growth strategy to most new retail and intermediary investors on February 1, 2016, and we plan to close the strategy to most new institutional investors and employee benefit plans on October 1, 2016. 

The Global Equity team employs a fundamental stock selection process focused on identifying companies within its preferred themes with sustainable growth characteristics at valuations that do not fully reflect their long-term potential. The team&#8217;s objective is to invest in companies that are industry leaders and have meaningful exposure to and will benefit from long-term secular growth trends. To identify long-term, sustainable growth characteristics of potential investments, the team seeks high-quality companies that typically have a sustainable competitive advantage, a superior business model and a high-quality management team. Finally, the team uses multiple valuation metrics to establish a target price range and assesses the relationship between its estimate of a company&#8217;s sustainable growth prospects and the company&#8217;s current valuation.

U.S. Value Team 

Our U.S. Value team, which was formed in 1997 and is based in Atlanta, Georgia, manages three investment strategies: U.S. Small-Cap Value, U.S. Mid-Cap Value and Value Equity. Scott C. Satterwhite, James C. Kieffer, George O. Sertl, Jr. and Daniel L. Kane are the portfolio co-managers for each of these strategies. Mr. Satterwhite plans to retire in September 2016. The U.S. Small-Cap Value and the U.S. Mid-Cap Value strategies are closed to most new investors and client relationships. In late February 2016 we announced that we plan to cease managing assets in the U.S. Small-Cap Value strategy. In connection with that decision, the board of directors of Artisan Funds approved a plan to reorganize Artisan Small Cap Value Fund into Artisan Mid Cap Value Fund. The reorganization is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. We plan to work with separate account clients on the transition or liquidation options available for their accounts. 

The U.S. Value team&#8217;s strategies employ a fundamental investment process used to construct diversified portfolios of companies that the team believes are undervalued, are in solid financial condition and have attractive business economics. The team believes companies with these characteristics are less likely to experience eroding values over the long term compared to companies without such characteristics. 

The team values a business using what it believes are reasonable expectations for the long-term earnings power and capitalization rates of that business. This results in a range of values for the company that the team believes would be reasonable. The team generally will purchase a security if the stock price falls below or toward the lower end of that range. 

The team prefers companies with an acceptable level of debt and positive cash flow. At a minimum, the team seeks to avoid companies that have so much debt that management may be unable to make decisions that would be in the best interest of the companies&#8217; shareholders. The team also favors cash-producing businesses that it believes are capable of earning acceptable returns on capital over the company&#8217;s business cycle.

Growth Team 

Our Growth team, which was formed in 1997 and is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, manages three investment strategies: U.S. Mid-Cap Growth, Global Opportunities and U.S. Small-Cap Growth. James D. Hamel, Matthew H. Kamm, Craigh A. Cepukenas, and Jason L. White are the portfolio co-managers of all three strategies. Mr. Kamm is the lead portfolio manager of the U.S. Mid-Cap Growth strategy; Mr. Hamel is the lead portfolio manager of the Global Opportunities strategy; and Mr. Cepukenas is the lead portfolio manager of the U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategy. The U.S. Mid-Cap Growth and U.S. Small-Cap Growth strategies are currently closed to most new investors and client relationships. 

The Growth team&#8217;s investment process focuses on two distinct areas-security selection and capital allocation. The team&#8217;s investment process begins by identifying companies that have franchise characteristics (e.g. low cost production capability, possession of a proprietary asset, dominant market share or a defensible brand name), are benefiting from an accelerating profit cycle and are trading at a discount to the team&#8217;s estimate of private market value. The team looks for companies that are well positioned for long-term growth, which is driven by demand for their products and services at an early enough stage in their profit cycle to benefit from the increased cash flows produced by the emerging profit cycle. 

Based on the investment team&#8217;s fundamental analysis of a company&#8217;s profit cycle, the investment team classifies each portfolio holding in one of three stages. Garden SM &#32;investments generally are smaller positions in the early part of their profit cycle that may warrant a larger allocation once their profit cycle accelerates. Crop SM &#32;investments are positions that are being increased to or maintained at a full weight because they are moving through the strongest part of their profit cycle. Harvest SM &#32;investments are positions that are being reduced as they near the investment team&#8217;s estimate of full valuation or their profit cycle begins to decelerate. The team overlays the security selection and capital allocation elements of its investment process with a desire to invest opportunistically across the entire global economy. The team seeks broad knowledge of the global economy in order to position it to find growth wherever it occurs.

Global Value Team 

Our Global Value team, which was formed in 2002 and is based in San Francisco, California, manages two investment strategies: Non-U.S. Value and Global Value. N. David Samra and Daniel J. O&#8217;Keefe are the portfolio co-managers of both strategies. Mr. Samra is the lead portfolio manager of the Non-U.S. Value strategy, and Mr. O&#8217;Keefe is the lead portfolio manager of the Global Value strategy. The Non-U.S. Value strategy is closed to most new investors and client relationships. We re-opened the Global Value strategy across pooled vehicles on October 1, 2015. The strategy remains closed to most new separate account clients. 

The Global Value team&#8217;s strategies employ a fundamental investment process used to construct diversified portfolios of companies. The team seeks to invest in what it considers to be high quality, undervalued companies with strong balance sheets and shareholder-oriented management teams. 

Determining the intrinsic value of a business is the heart of the team&#8217;s research process. The team believes that intrinsic value represents the amount that a buyer would pay to own a company&#8217;s future cash flows. The team seeks to invest at a significant discount to its estimate of the intrinsic value of a business. The team also seeks to invest in companies with histories of generating strong free cash flow, improving returns on capital and strong competitive positions in their industries. The team believes that investing in companies with strong balance sheets helps to reduce the potential for capital risk and provides company management the ability to build value when attractive opportunities are available. The team&#8217;s research process also attempts to identify management teams with a history of building value for shareholders. 

The team ranks companies that make it through this analytical process according to the degree of the discount of the current market price of the stock to the team&#8217;s estimate of the company&#8217;s intrinsic value. The team manages its strategies by generally taking larger positions in companies where the discount is greatest and smaller positions in companies with narrower discounts (subject to adjustments for investment-related concerns, including, diversification, risk management and liquidity).

Emerging Markets Team 

Our Emerging Markets team, which was formed in 2006 and is based in New York, New York, manages a single investment strategy. Maria Negrete-Gruson is the portfolio manager for the Emerging Markets strategy. In late February 2016, a client of our Emerging Markets strategy communicated its intent to terminate its account with us during the second quarter of 2016. The client&#8217;s account represents approximately one-half of the assets under management in the Emerging Markets strategy as of the date of this filing. 

The Emerging Markets team employs a fundamental research process to construct a diversified portfolio of emerging market companies. The team seeks to invest in companies that it believes are uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth potential in emerging markets and possess a sustainable global competitive advantage. The team believes that over the long-term a stock&#8217;s price is directly related to the company&#8217;s ability to deliver sustainable earnings, which the team determines based upon financial and strategic analyses. The team also believes that a disciplined risk framework allows greater focus on fundamental stock selection. The team incorporates its assessment of company-specific and macroeconomic risks into its valuation analysis to develop a risk adjusted target price. The risk-rating assessment includes a review of the currency, inflation, monetary and fiscal policy and political risks to which a company is exposed. Finally, the team believes that investment opportunities develop when businesses with sustainable earnings are undervalued relative to peers and historical industry, country and regional valuations. The team values a business and develops a price target for a company based on its assessment of the business&#8217;s sustainable earnings and risk assessment.

Credit Team 

Our Credit team, which was formed in 2014 and is based in Mission Woods, Kansas, manages a single investment strategy. Bryan L. Krug is the portfolio manager for the High Income strategy. The Credit team seeks to invest in issuers with high quality business models that have compelling risk-adjusted return characteristics. The team invests primarily in non-investment grade corporate bonds and secured and unsecured loans of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. The team&#8217;s research process has four primary pillars: business quality; financial strength and flexibility; downside analysis; and value identification. 

The team analyzes the general health of the industry in which an issuer operates, the issuer&#8217;s competitive position, the dynamics of industry participants, and the decision-making history of the issuer&#8217;s management. To understand an issuer&#8217;s financial health, the team believes it is critical to analyze the history and trend of free cash flow. The team also considers an issuer&#8217;s capital structure, refinancing options, financial covenants, amortization schedules and overall financial transparency. The team seeks to manage the risk of loss with what it believes to be conservative financial projections that account for industry position, competitive dynamics and positioning within the capital structure. To determine the value of an investment opportunity the team uses multiple valuation metrics. The team looks for credit improvement potential, relative value within an issuer&#8217;s capital structure, catalysts for business improvement and potential value stemming from market or industry dislocations. 

The Credit team generally determines the amount of assets invested in each issuer based on conviction, valuation and availability of supply. Based on the team&#8217;s analysis it divides the portfolio into three parts. Core investments are generally positions with stable to improving credit profiles and lower loan to value ratios. Spread investments are those where the team has an out-of-consensus view about a company&#8217;s credit improvement potential. Opportunistic investments are driven by market dislocations that have created a unique investment opportunity.

Developing World Team 

Our Developing World team, which was formed in 2015 and is based in San Francisco, California, manages a single investment strategy. Lewis S. Kaufman is the portfolio manager for the Developing World strategy. 

The Developing World team employs a fundamental investment process to construct a diversified portfolio of securities that offers exposure to developing world economies. In pursuit of this goal, the team generally invests substantially in companies domiciled in or economically tied to countries the team considers to have characteristics typical of the developing world. The team generally seeks to emphasize business value compounders, which it defines as financially sound, free cash flow generative companies with sound business models that are exposed to the growth potential of the developing world. The team may seek to mitigate currency volatility by emphasizing investments in countries and currencies that are less dependent on foreign capital. The Developing World team believes a portfolio of companies with these characteristics will be well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. 

The Developing World strategy began operations in June of 2015. Its gross return since composite inception (July 1, 2015) is (11.75)% &#32;compared to (17.35)% &#32;for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over the same period. 

Distribution, Investment Products and Client Relationships 

The goal of our marketing, distribution and client service efforts is to establish and maintain a client base that is diversified by investment strategy, investment vehicle (for example, across mutual funds and separate accounts), distribution channel (for example, institutional, intermediary and retail) and geographic region. 

We focus our distribution and marketing efforts on institutions and on intermediaries that operate with institutional-like, centralized decision-making processes and longer-term investment horizons. 

We have designed our distribution strategies and structured our distribution teams to use knowledgeable, seasoned marketing and client service professionals in a way intended to limit the time our investment professionals are required to spend in marketing and client service activities. We believe that minimizing other demands allows our portfolio managers and other investment professionals to focus their energies and attention on the investment decision-making process, which we believe enhances the opportunity to achieve superior investment returns. 

Our distribution efforts are centrally managed by Dean J. Patenaude, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Distribution, who oversees and coordinates the efforts of our marketing and client service professionals. We are expanding our distribution efforts into non-U.S. markets, with our primary non-U.S. efforts focused currently on the United Kingdom, other European countries, Australia, Canada and certain Asian countries where we believe there is growing demand for global and non-U.S. investment strategies. In our non-U.S. distribution efforts, we use regional specialists who draw on the knowledge and expertise of our strategy-focused professionals. As of December 31, 2015 , 14% of our total assets under management were sourced from clients located outside the United States. 

Institutional Channel 

Our institutional distribution channel includes traditional institutional clients, such as U.S.-registered mutual funds, non-U.S. funds and collective investment trusts we sub-advise; state and local governments; employee benefit plans including Taft-Hartley plans; foundations; and endowments. We offer our investment products to these types of institutional clients directly and by marketing our services to the investment consultants that advise them. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 39% of our assets under management were sourced through investment consultants, and no single consulting firm represented clients (including investors in Artisan Funds) having more than 7% of our assets under management. 

Our institutional distribution channel also includes defined contribution/401(k) plans. An investor in the defined contribution/401(k) marketplace may access our services via Artisan Funds shares and separate accounts (including collective investment trusts). Although the vehicles utilized in the defined contribution marketplace continue to evolve, most of our defined contribution/401(k) assets under management are invested in Artisan Funds, shares of which are offered as an investment option on a number of 401(k) platforms. We include defined contribution/401(k) plan assets in our institutional distribution channel because we access these assets through investment consultants who advise defined contribution/401(k) plans and other institutional decision makers. As of December 31, 2015 , our largest 401(k) plan provider relationship accounted for approximately 4% of our assets under management. 

As of December 31, 2015 , 65% &#32;of our assets under management were sourced through our institutional channel. 

Intermediary Channel 

We maintain relationships with a number of major brokerage firms and larger private banks. More broker-dealers have moved to an open architecture model under which they strive to offer &#8220;best-in-breed&#8221; investment strategies to their clients, as do the larger private banks and trust companies with which we have relationships. In those organizations, the process for identifying which funds to offer has been centralized to a relatively limited number of key decision-makers that exhibit institutional decision-making behavior, which we believe allows us to gain broad exposure to broker-dealer and private bank clients in a manner consistent with our distribution strategy. We also maintain relationships with a number of financial advisory firms that offer our investment products to their clients. These advisors range from relatively small firms to large organizations. We access high net worth individuals and other non-institutional or small institutional investors through these relationships. 

As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 30% &#32;of our assets under management were sourced through our intermediary channel, and our largest intermediary relationship represented approximately 3% of our assets under management. 

Retail Channel 

We primarily access retail investors indirectly through mutual fund supermarkets through which investors have the ability to purchase and redeem shares without another intermediary. The providers of mutual fund supermarkets typically have recommended lists that are effective in promoting purchases of shares of mutual funds included in the list. Investors can also invest directly in the series of Artisan Funds. Our subsidiary, Artisan Partners Distributors LLC, a registered broker-dealer, distributes shares of Artisan Funds. Publicity and reviews and rankings from Morningstar, Lipper and others are important in building the Artisan Partners brand, which is important in attracting retail investors. As a result, we publicize the ratings and rankings received by the series of Artisan Funds and work to ensure that potential retail investors have appropriate information to evaluate a potential investment in Artisan Funds. We do not generally use direct marketing campaigns as we believe that their cost outweighs their potential benefits. 

As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 5% &#32;of our assets under management were sourced from investors we categorize as retail investors. 

Access Through a Range of Investment Vehicles 

Our clients access our investment strategies through a range of investment vehicles, including separate accounts and mutual funds. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 46% of our assets under management were in separate accounts, and Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds accounted for approximately 54% of our total assets under management. 

Separate Accounts 

We manage separate account assets within most of our investment strategies. As of December 31, 2015 , we managed 217 separate accounts spanning 147 client relationships. Our separate account clients include pension and profit sharing plans, corporations, trusts, endowments, foundations, charitable organizations, government entities, insurance companies, investment advisers, and private funds, as well as mutual funds, non-U.S. funds and collective investment trusts we sub-advise. We generally require a minimum account size of $20 million to $100 million, depending on the strategy, to manage a separate account. The separate accounts we manage include all or part of the portfolios of several U.S.-registered mutual funds and non-U.S.-based funds pursuant to sub-advisory agreements with their primary advisers. The institutions with which we enter into sub-advisory relationships include financial services companies supplementing their own product offerings with externally managed products. For these clients, the portfolio or sub-portfolio we manage is managed in accordance with one of our identified investment strategies. We also offer access to our Non-U.S. Growth, Value Equity, Global Equity, Global Opportunities and Developing World strategies through Artisan-branded collective investment trusts. The fees we charge our separate accounts vary by client, investment strategy and the size of the account and are accrued monthly, but generally are paid quarterly in arrears. 

Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds 

U.S. investors that do not meet our minimum account size for a separate account, or who otherwise prefer to invest through a mutual fund, can invest in our strategies through Artisan Funds. We serve as the investment adviser to each series of Artisan Funds, SEC-registered mutual funds that offer no-load, open-end share classes designed to meet the needs of a range of institutional and other investors. Each series of Artisan Funds corresponds to one of the investment strategies we offer to clients. In contrast to some mutual funds, investors in Artisan Funds pay no 12b-1 fees, which are fees charged to investors in addition to management fees to pay for marketing, advertising and distribution services associated with the mutual funds. Expenses for marketing, advertising and distribution services related to Artisan Funds, including payments to broker-dealers and other intermediaries, are paid out of the investment management fees we earn. We earn investment management fees, which are based on the average daily net assets of each Artisan Fund and are paid monthly, for serving as investment adviser to these funds. 

We also serve as investment manager of Artisan Global Funds, a family of Ireland-based UCITS funds. Artisan Global Funds began operations in the first quarter of 2011 and offers shares to non-U.S. investors. Currently we offer a sub-fund of Artisan Global Funds corresponding to each of the Global Opportunities, Global Value, Global Equity, Value Equity and Emerging Markets strategies. As with Artisan Funds, investors in Artisan Global Funds do not pay fees for marketing, advertising and distribution services. Expenses for marketing, advertising and distribution services related to Artisan Global Funds, including payments to broker-dealers and other intermediaries, are paid out of the investment management fees we earn, which are based on the average daily net assets of each sub-fund and are generally paid quarterly. 

Regulatory Environment and Compliance 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level, as well as by self-regulatory organizations and outside the United States. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. 

SEC Regulation 

Artisan Partners Limited Partnership and Artisan Partners UK LLP are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and Artisan Funds and several of the investment companies we sub-advise are registered under the 1940 Act. The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC&#8217;s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and mutual funds. The Securities Act and the Exchange Act, along with the regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose additional restrictions and requirements on mutual funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of those Acts, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser&#8217;s registration. 

As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things: trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of investment opportunities among clients; use of soft dollars; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for our clients on a discretionary basis, with authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. 

All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations including regulations imposed by non-U.S. regulators, our operating expenses would increase. 

As a registered adviser, we are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things, disclosure of information about our business to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge; custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) in a manner that is consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate systems and procedures to ensure compliance. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 68% of our revenues were derived from our advisory services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, including 65% &#32;from our advisory services to Artisan Funds. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of Artisan Funds and the investment portfolios of Artisan Funds and the funds we sub-advise, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by each fund&#8217;s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors must not be &#8220;interested persons&#8221; with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the &#8220;independent director&#8221; requirement). The responsibilities of the board include, among other things, approving our investment management agreement with the fund; approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. 

Our investment management agreements with these funds may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days&#8217; notice, and are subject to annual renewal by each fund&#8217;s board after the initial term of one to two years. The 1940 Act also imposes on the investment adviser to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the adviser&#8217;s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action or by litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action. The number of cases brought by investors pursuant to this private right of action has increased in recent years. 

As required by the Advisers Act, our investment management agreements may not be assigned without the client&#8217;s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment management agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term &#8220;assignment&#8221; is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in us. 

Artisan Partners Distributors LLC, our SEC-registered broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires that at least a minimum part of a registered broker-dealer&#8217;s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. At December 31, 2015 , Artisan Partners Distributors LLC had net capital of $153,664, which was $128,664 in excess of its required net capital of $25,000. 

ERISA-Related Regulation 

Artisan Partners Limited Partnership is a fiduciary under ERISA with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, regulations promulgated thereunder and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. 

Non-U.S. Regulation 

In addition to the extensive regulation we are subject to in the United States, one of our subsidiaries, Artisan Partners UK LLP, is authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which is responsible for the conduct of business and supervision of financial firms in the United Kingdom. The Central Bank of Ireland imposes requirements on UCITS funds subject to regulation by it, including Artisan Global Funds, as do the regulators in certain other markets in which shares of Artisan Global Funds are offered for sale, and with which we are required to comply. We are also subject to regulation internationally by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, where we operate pursuant to orders of exemption, and by various Canadian regulatory authorities in the Canadian provinces where we operate pursuant to exemptions from registration. Our business is also subject to the rules and regulations of the countries in which we conduct investment management activities, including the countries in which our investment strategies make investments. We may become subject to additional regulatory demands in the future to the extent we expand our business in existing and new jurisdictions. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to our Industry&#8212;We are subject to extensive regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to our Industry&#8212;The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change, and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may adversely affect our business.&#8221; 

Competition 

In order to grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Historically, we have competed to attract assets to our management principally on the basis of: 

&#8226; 

the performance of our investment strategies; 

&#8226; 

continuity of our investment professionals; 

&#8226; 

the quality of the service we provide to our clients; and 

&#8226; 

our brand recognition and reputation within the institutional investing community. 

Our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to retain our current investment professionals and employees and to attract highly qualified new investment professionals and employees. We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see &#8220;Risks Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Industry&#8212;The investment management industry is intensely competitive.&#8221; 

Operations, Systems and Technology 

With respect to our equity strategies, we perform middle- and back-office functions internally, generally using third-party software and technology for functions such as trade confirmation, trade settlement, custodian reconciliations, corporate action processing, performance calculation and client reporting, customized as necessary to support our investment processes and operations. With respect to our High Income strategy, which is currently our only fixed income strategy, we outsource most of the middle- and back-office functions to service providers that we supervise. Artisan Funds and Artisan Global Funds outsource the functions of custodian, transfer agent and portfolio accounting agent to third parties whose services to Artisan Funds or Artisan Global Funds we supervise. We also have back-up and disaster recovery systems in place. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 370 full-time and part-time employees. None of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. 

Our Structure and Reorganization 

Holding Company Structure 

We are a holding company and our assets principally consist of our ownership of partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings, deferred tax assets and cash. As the sole general partner of Artisan Partners Holdings, we operate and control all of its business and affairs, subject to certain voting rights of its limited partners. We conduct all of our business activities through operating subsidiaries of Artisan Partners Holdings. Net profits and net losses are allocated based on the ownership of partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned approximately 54% &#32;of Artisan Partners Holdings, and the other 46% &#32;was owned by the limited partners of Artisan Partners Holdings. 

The historical consolidated financial statements presented and discussed elsewhere in this document are the combined and consolidated results of Artisan Partners Asset Management and Artisan Partners Holdings. Because Artisan Partners Asset Management and Artisan Partners Holdings were under common control at the time of our IPO reorganization in March 2013, Artisan Partners Asset Management&#8217;s acquisition of control of Artisan Partners Holdings was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control. Artisan Partners Asset Management has been allocated a part of Artisan Partners Holdings&#8217; net income since March 12, 2013, when it became Artisan Partners Holdings&#8217; general partner as part of the IPO reorganization discussed below. 

IPO Reorganization 

In March 2013, we completed our IPO. In connection with the IPO, we and Artisan Partners Holdings completed a series of reorganization transactions, which we refer to as the IPO Reorganization, in order to reorganize our capital structures in preparation for the IPO. The IPO Reorganization was designed to create a capital structure that preserves our ability to conduct our business through Artisan Partners Holdings, while permitting us to raise additional capital and provide access to liquidity through a public company. Multiple classes of securities at the public company level were necessary to achieve those objectives and maintain a corporate governance structure consistent with that of Artisan Partners Holdings prior to the IPO Reorganization. The IPO Reorganization included, among other changes, the following: 

&#8226; 

Our appointment as the sole general partner of Artisan Partners Holdings. 

&#8226; 

The modification of our capital structure into three classes of common stock and a series of convertible preferred stock. We issued shares of our Class B common stock, Class C common stock and convertible preferred stock to pre-IPO partners of Artisan Partners Holdings. Each share of Class B common stock corresponds to a Class B common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings. Each share of Class C common stock corresponds to either a Class A, Class D or Class E common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings. Subject to certain restrictions, each common unit of Artisan Partners Holdings (together with the corresponding share of Class B or Class C common stock) is exchangeable for a share of our Class A common stock. 

&#8226; 

A corporation (&#8220;H&#38;F Corp&#8221;) merged with and into Artisan Partners Asset Management, which we refer to in this document as the H&#38;F Corp Merger. As consideration for the merger, the shareholder of H&#38;F Corp received shares of our convertible preferred stock, contingent value rights, or CVRs, issued by Artisan Partners Asset Management and the right to receive an amount of cash. In November 2013, the CVRs issued by Artisan Partners Asset Management were terminated with no amounts paid or payable thereunder. In June 2014, the shareholder of H&#38;F Corp converted all of its then-remaining shares of convertible preferred stock into shares of Class A common stock and sold those shares. We no longer have any outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, and Artisan Partners Holdings no longer has any outstanding preferred units. 

&#8226; 

The voting and certain other rights of each class of limited partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings were modified. In addition, Artisan Partners Holdings issued CVRs to the holders of the preferred units. In November 2013, the CVRs issued by Artisan Partners Holdings were terminated with no amounts paid or payable thereunder. 

&#8226; 

We entered into two tax receivable agreements (&#8220;TRAs&#8221;), one with the pre-H&#38;F Corp Merger shareholder of H&#38;F Corp (&#8220;Pre-H&#38;F Merger Shareholder&#8221;) and the other with each limited partner of Artisan Partners Holdings. Pursuant to the first TRA, we will pay to the Pre-H&#38;F Merger Shareholder a portion of certain tax benefits we realize as a result of the H&#38;F Corp Merger. Pursuant to the second TRA, we will pay to certain limited partners of Artisan Partners Holdings a portion of certain tax benefits we realize as a result of the purchase or exchange of their limited partnership units of Artisan Partners Holdings. 

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015 : 

(1) 

Our employees to whom we have granted equity have entered into a stockholders agreement with respect to all shares of our common stock they have acquired from us and any shares they may acquire from us in the future, pursuant to which they granted an irrevocable voting proxy to a stockholders committee currently consisting of Eric R. Colson (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), Charles J. Daley (Chief Financial Officer) and Gregory K. Ramirez (Executive Vice President). The stockholders committee, by vote of a majority of the members, will determine the vote of all of the shares subject to the stockholders agreement. In addition to owning all of the shares of our Class B common stock, our employees owned unvested restricted shares of our Class A common stock representing approximately 7% of our outstanding Class A common stock as of December 31, 2015. 

(2) 

Each share of Class B common stock initially entitles its holder to five votes per share. The stockholders committee holds an irrevocable proxy to vote the shares of our common stock held by the Class B common stockholders. 

(3) 

Each class of common units generally entitles its holders to the same economic and voting rights in Artisan Partners Holdings as each other class of common units, except that the Class E common units have no voting rights except as required by law.
