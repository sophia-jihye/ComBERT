 Item 1. Business 

General 

Frank&#8217;s International N.V. ("FINV") is a Netherlands limited liability company ( Naamloze Vennootschap ) and includes the activities of Frank&#8217;s International C.V. ("FICV") and its wholly owned subsidiaries (either individually or together, as context requires, the "Company," "we," "us" and "our"). We were established in 1938 and are an industry-leading global provider of highly engineered tubular services to the oil and gas industry. We provide our services to leading exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments, with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells. We believe that we are one of the largest global providers of tubular services to the oil and gas industry. 

Our Operations 

Tubular services involve the handling and installation of multiple joints of pipe to establish a cased wellbore and the installation of smaller diameter pipe inside a cased wellbore to provide a conduit for produced oil and gas to reach the surface. The casing of a wellbore isolates the wellbore from the surrounding geologic formations and water table, provides well structure and pressure integrity, and allows well operators to target specific zones for production. Given the central role that our services play in the structural integrity, reliability and safety of a well, and the importance of efficient tubular services to managing the overall cost of a well, we believe that our role is vital to the overall process of producing oil and gas. 

In addition to our services offerings, we design and manufacture certain products that we sell directly to external customers, including large outside diameter (&#8220;OD&#8221;) pipe connectors. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of deep water projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 300 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. Finally, we distribute large OD pipe manufactured by third parties, and generally maintain an inventory of this pipe in order to support our pipe sales and distribution operations. 

We offer our tubular services and tubular sales through our three operating segments: (1) International Services, (2) U.S. Services and (3) Tubular Sales, each of which is described in more detail in "Description of Business Segments."

In June 2013, we sold a component of our Tubular Sales segment and, as a result, the operations from that component have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Our Organizational Structure 

We completed our initial public offering ("IPO") on August 14, 2013. Immediately prior to the completion of our IPO, Mosing Holdings, Inc. ("MHI") contributed all of the outstanding membership interests in each of Frank's International, LLC, Frank's Casing Crew &#38; Rental Tools, LLC and Frank's Tong Service, LLC, which constitute our U.S. operating subsidiaries, to FICV in exchange for 52,976,000 shares of our Series A preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock") and a 25.7% limited partnership interest in FICV. FICV is a partnership that was formed to act as a holding company of various U.S. and foreign operating companies engaged in our business. Excluded from the contribution were certain assets that generated a de minimis amount of revenue, including aircraft, real estate and life insurance policies, which were retained by MHI. 

FINV contributed all of its international operating subsidiaries and a portion of the proceeds from the IPO to FICV. Following the completion of the IPO, FINV's sole material asset consisted of its ownership of 74.2% of the limited partnership interest and the 0.1% general partnership interest in FICV. MHI held the remaining 25.7% limited partnership interest in FICV. 

MHI has the right to convert all or a portion of its Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock by delivery of an equivalent portion of its interest in FICV to us. Accordingly, the increase in our interest in FICV in connection with such conversion will decrease the noncontrolling interest in our financial statements that is attributable to MHI's interest in FICV. 

Description of Business Segments 

International Services 

The International Services segment provides tubular services in international offshore markets and in several onshore international regions in approximately 60 countries on six continents. Our customers in these international markets are primarily large exploration and production companies, including integrated oil and gas companies and national oil and gas companies. 

U. S. Services 

The U.S. Services segment provides tubular services in almost all of the active onshore oil and gas drilling regions in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, Bakken Shale, Barnett Shale, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale , as well as in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Tubular Sales 

The Tubular Sales segment designs, manufactures and distributes large OD pipe, connectors and casing attachments and sells large OD pipe originally manufactured by various pipe mills. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of offshore projects, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 300 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. This segment also designs and manufactures proprietary equipment for use in our International Services and U.S. Services segments. 

Financial Information About Segment and Geographic Areas 

Segment financial and geographic information is provided in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our component parts, products or specific raw materials are only available from a limited number of suppliers. 

Our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings, is critical to our ability to manufacture our drilling products competitively and, in turn, our ability to provide onshore and offshore drilling services. In order to purchase raw materials and components in a cost effective manner we have developed a broad international sourcing capability and we maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components. 

&#160; 

Patents 

We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have a number of pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license as critical or essential to our business as a whole. 

Seasonality 

A substantial portion of our business is not significantly impacted by changing seasons. We can be impacted by hurricanes, ocean currents, winter storms and other disruptions. 

Customers 

Our customers consist primarily of oil and gas exploration and production companies, both U.S. and international, including major and independent companies, national oil companies and, on occasion, other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide casing and handling services. Demand for our services depends primarily upon the capital spending of oil and gas companies and the level of drilling activity in the U.S. and internationally. We do not believe the loss of any of our individual customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Our International Services segment had no single customer that contributed more than 10% of its revenue in 2015. Our U.S. Services and Tubular Sales segments each had three customers which accounted for more than 10% of their revenue in 2015. 

Competition 

The markets in which we operate are competitive. We compete with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours. The principal competitive factors in our markets are the quality, price and availability of products and services and a company&#8217;s responsiveness to customer needs and its reputation for safety. In general, we face a larger number of smaller, more regionally-specific customers in the U.S. onshore market as compared to offshore markets, where larger competitors dominate. 

We believe several factors give us a strong competitive position. In particular, we believe our products and services in each segment fulfill our customer&#8217;s requirements for international capability, availability of tools, range of services provided, intellectual property, technological sophistication, rigorous quality systems and availability of equipment, along with reputation and safety record. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a rapid response to the needs of our customers, a high level of customer service and innovative product development initiatives. Although we have no single competitor across all of our product lines, we believe that Weatherford International represents our most direct competitor across our segments for providing tubular services on an aggregate, global basis. 

Market Environment 

As a result of the dramatic downturn in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and continuing into 2016 to date, many of our customers have reduced their oil and natural gas drilling activities. In addition, we expect oil and gas exploration and production companies to cut capital budgets from 2015 levels globally. A further decrease in project spending from our customers is expected to translate to a similar decrease in our earnings. We believe that we have mitigated in 2015 and going-forward in 2016 will be able to mitigate some of the impact of lower revenues through both previously implemented as well as additional planned cost reductions. We expect continued weakness in the U.S. onshore business segment and lower revenues in International Services as pricing pressure and the scope of our service activity shifts. Additionally, despite the strong margins recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect the adjusted EBITDA contribution from Tubular Sales to decrease in the first quarter of 2016 as visibility on new orders and expected deliveries is significantly lower than the first quarter of 2015. 

Inventories and Working Capital 

An important consideration for many of our customers in selecting a vendor is timely availability of the product. Often customers will pay a premium for earlier or immediate availability because of the cost of delays in critical operations. We aim to stock certain of our consumable products in regional warehouses around the world so we can have these products available for our customers when needed. This availability is especially critical for our proprietary products, causing us to carry substantial inventories for these products. For critical capital items for which demand is expected to be strong, we often build certain items before we have a firm order. Having such goods available on short notice can be of great value to our customers. 

Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance. &#32; 

Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), analogous state agencies and, in certain circumstances, citizens&#8217; groups, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Certain environmental laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 

Hazardous Substances and Waste 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with 

their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA. 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the &#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility from which a discharge occurs. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water from our operations and may be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as &#8220;SPCC plans,&#8221; in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil, including refined petroleum products. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other emission control requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting non-compliant operations. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter air emissions permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state &#8220;minor source&#8221; air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements applicable to air emissions. 

Climate Change 

The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air 

Act. The EPA has proposed various measures regulating the emission of greenhouse gases, including proposed performance standards for new and existing power plants, and pre-construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources already subject to the Clean Air Act. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as onshore oil and gas production facilities, on an annual basis. 

In addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and many of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the state of California has adopted a "cap and trade program" that requires major sources of greenhouse gas emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. 

The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs in the U.S. or abroad designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for methane emissions for certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of the overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent in 2025. These rules have the potential to impose significant costs on our customers. Also, new legislation or regulatory programs related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas produced by our customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice in the oil and gas industry. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production of hydrocarbons. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers utilize this technique. Certain environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies have suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water resources and may cause earthquakes. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly or indirectly. For example, the EPA has already begun to regulate certain hydraulic fracturing operations involving diesel under the Underground Injection Control program of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and is conducting a study to determine if additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing is warranted. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. The draft report is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and a formal review by the EPA's Science Advisory Board. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs that restrict hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect, reduce or delay well drilling and completion activities, increase the cost of drilling and production, and thereby reduce demand for our services. 

Employee Health and Safety 

We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be 

maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 

We also operate in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may impose similar liabilities against us. We do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on us. However, we also believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future. 

Operating Risk and Insurance 

We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. 

Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers&#8217; compensation, and employer&#8217;s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 3,900 employees worldwide. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements or other similar arrangements in certain international areas in which we operate, such as Brazil, Asia Pacific, Africa and Europe. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
