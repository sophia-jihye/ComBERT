 ITEM 1. BUSINESS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 

The Company&#8217;s business began in 1974 when the Company&#8217;s former Chairman of the Board, Vaso Boreta opened a &#8220;Las Vegas Discount Golf and Tennis&#8221; retail store in Las Vegas, Nevada. This store subsequently began distributing catalogs and developing a mail order business for the sale of golf and tennis products. In 1984, the Company began to franchise the &#8220;Las Vegas Discount Golf &#38; Tennis retail store concept and commenced the sale of franchises. As of February 26, 1997 when the franchise business was sold, the Company had 43 franchised stores in operation in 17 states and 2 foreign countries. 

The Company was incorporated in Nevada on March 6, 1984, under the name &#8220;Sporting Life, Inc.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s name was changed to &#8220;St. Andrews Golf Corporation&#8221; on December 27, 1988, to &#8220;Saint Andrews Golf Corporation&#8221; on August 12, 1994, and finally to All-American SportPark, Inc. (&#8220;AASP&#8221;) on December 14, 1998. 

Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. (&#8220;SPEN&#8221;), formerly known as Las Vegas Golf &#38; Tennis, Inc. (&#8220;LVDG&#8221;), which had been a publicly traded company, acquired the Company in February 1988, from Vaso Boreta, who was the Company&#8217;s sole shareholder. Vaso Boreta also served as SPEN&#8217;s Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO until February 2005. 

In December 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering of 1,000,000 Units, each Unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and one Class A Warrant. The net proceeds to the Company from this public offering were approximately $3,684,000. The Class A Warrants expired unexercised on March 15, 1999. 

On July 12, 1996, the Company entered into a lease agreement covering approximately 65 acres of land in Las Vegas, Nevada, on which the Company developed its Callaway Golf Center and All-American SportPark, (&#8220;SportPark&#8221;) properties. The property is located on the world famous Las Vegas &#8220;Strip&#8221; at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sunset Road which is just south of McCarran International Airport and the Mandalay Bay and MGM Resorts. The property is also adjacent to the Interstate 215 beltway that encircles the entire Las Vegas valley. On 42 acres of the property is the golf center (now called the &#8220;TaylorMade Golf Experience&#8221;) that opened for business in October 1997. The remaining 23 acres was home to the discontinued SportPark that opened for business in October 1998 and was disposed of in May 2001. The lease for the golf center was for fifteen years with options to extend for two additional five-year terms. The first five year option to extend was exercised in 2012. 

During June 1997, the Company and Callaway Golf Company (&#8220;Callaway&#8221;) formed All-American Golf LLC (&#8220;LLC&#8221;), a California limited liability company that was owned 80% by the Company and 20% by Callaway; the LLC owned and operated the golf center. In May 1998, the Company sold its 80% interest in LLC to Callaway. On December 31, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of LLC subject to certain liabilities that resulted in the Company owning 100% of the golf center. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

On October 19, 1998, the Company sold 250,000 shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to SPEN for $2,500,000. SPEN had earlier issued 2,303,290 shares of its common stock for $2,500,000 in a private transaction to ASI Group, L.L.C. (&#8220;ASI&#8221;). ASI also received 347,975 stock options for SPEN common stock. ASI is a Nevada limited liability company whose members include Andre Agassi, a former professional tennis player. 

SPEN owned 2,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and 250,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In the aggregate, this represented approximately two-thirds ownership in the Company. On April 5, 2002, SPEN elected to convert its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock into common Stock on a 1 for 1 basis. On May 8, 2002, SPEN completed a spin-off of the Company&#8217;s shares held by SPEN to SPEN&#8217;s shareholders. This resulted in SPEN no longer having any ownership interest in the Company. 

On June 15, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Transfer Agreement with Saint Andrews pursuant to which the Company transferred 49% of the outstanding common stock of All-American Golf Center, Inc. (&#34;AAGC&#34;), a subsidiary of the Company, to Saint Andrews Golf Shop, Ltd. (&#34;Saint Andrews&#34;) in exchange for the cancellation of $600,000 of debt owed by the Company to Saint Andrews. The transfer of 49% of the common stock of AAGC was authorized by the Company's Board of Directors at which all of the Company's Directors voted in favor of the transfer, except that Ronald Boreta abstained from such vote. In connection with this transaction, the Company engaged Houlihan Valuation Advisors (&#34;HVA&#34;) to provide an estimate of the fair market value of a 49% interest in AAGC. As a result of their analysis, HVA was of the opinion that the fair market value of a 49% interest in AAGC was approximately $600,000. The Board of Directors determined to use this value as the amount to be received from Saint Andrews for the 49% interest. 

Saint Andrews is owned by Ronald Boreta, the Company's President and a Director and John Boreta, his brother. John Boreta is a principal shareholder of the Company and became Director of the Company in 2012. The debt owed by the Company to Saint Andrews was from advances made in the past by Saint Andrews to provide the Company with working capital. 

The original Las Vegas Golf and Tennis store closed to the public in May of 2010. The owner, Vaso Boreta who had retired, passed away in October 2013. 

On June 19, 2009, AAGC entered into a Customer Agreement with Callaway Golf Company (&#34;Callaway&#34;) and Saint Andrews pursuant to which Callaway has agreed to make certain cash payments and other consideration to AAGC and Saint Andrews in exchange for an exclusive marketing arrangement for the golf center operated by AAGC. Callaway is a major golf equipment manufacturer and supplier. 

On March 9, 2013, AAGC entered into an amendment to its Customer Agreement with Callaway (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;). The Amendment provided that AAGC was to use all reasonable efforts to negotiate and enter into a non-exclusive written contract with an alternative retail branding partner. In the event that AAGC was successful in executing a written contract with an alternative retail branding partner, the Customer Agreement would terminate on June 30, 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, Callaway was not required to pay any marketing funds or other fees or expenses required under the Customer Agreement during the first two quarters of 2013. The Amendment also provided that Callaway could, at its option, continue to feature its products in a second position at the golf center after termination of the Customer Agreement, under certain terms and conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

On March 27, 2013, AAGC entered into a Golf Center Sponsorship Agreement (&#8220;Sponsorship Agreement&#8221;) with Taylor Made Golf Company, Inc., doing business as TaylorMade-adidas Golf Company (&#8220;TMaG&#8221;) pursuant to which the golf center operated by AAGC was to be rebranded using TaylorMade&#174; and other TMaG trademarks. 

As part of the Sponsorship Agreement, TMaG agreed to reimburse AAGC for the reasonable costs associated with the rebranding efforts, including the costs associated with the build-out of the golf center and a new performance lab (described below), up to a specified maximum amount. In addition AAGC received a payment of $200,000 upon execution of the Sponsorship Agreement and, so long as AAGC continues to operate the golf center and comply with the terms and conditions of the Sponsorship Agreement TMaG was to make additional payments to AAGC on each of March 26, 2014 and March 26, 2015. In March 2015, AAGC received the final payment in the amount of $150,000. 

The Sponsorship Agreement provides that TMaG would install a performance lab at AAGC's facility that would include one nine-camera motion analysis system and one putting lab, and would provide additional services, equipment, supplies and resources for the golf center. The performance lab was installed in 2013. The Sponsorship Agreement includes provisions concerning the display of TMaG merchandise, payment terms, retail sales targets and other related matters. Also, Saint Andrews Golf Shop, a tenant of AAGC which is owned by Ronald Boreta, the Company's President, and John Boreta, a Director of the Company, receives a quarterly rebate based on the wholesale price of the TMaG merchandise purchased at the golf center. In addition, provided that the Las Vegas Golf and Tennis stores owned by Ronald Boreta and John Boreta maintains TMaG as their premier vendor at its locations, TMaG pays such stores a quarterly rebate based on the wholesale price of the TMaG merchandise purchased at those locations. The initial term of the Sponsorship Agreement is for five years. AAGC and TMaG may mutually agree in writing to extend the Sponsorship Agreement for an additional four year period; provided that the option to renew the Agreement shall be determined by the parties not later than ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term and shall be consistent with the AAGC's lease on its golf center property. 

The facility changed its name from &#8220;Callaway Golf Center&#8221; to &#8220;Las Vegas Golf Center&#8221; on July 1, 2013 and subsequently to &#8220;TaylorMade Golf Experience&#8221; in early November 2013. 

TMaG began work on the new &#8220;TaylorMade Golf Experience&#8221; in September of 2013, which involved a complete remodel of the St. Andrews Golf Shop and the inside lobby of the TaylorMade Golf Experience. This included a small increase in space to add an indoor putting green and a consolidation of cash wraps (check-out counters) to allow customers to make multiple purchases from St. Andrews Golf Shop and TaylorMade Golf Experience in a single transaction. During the remodel, the store and golf activities counter operated out of a tent on the property. We began operations in the newly remodeled area in December 2013 and the remodeling was completed in early 2014.

&#160; 

Phase 2 began construction on January 20, 2015 and was completed in March of 2015. This includes FlightScope Technology (which uses Doppler radar to provide 3D tracking of golf shots) in kiosks on the Upper Westside Driving Range, outside performance bays and a mobile shop where custom TaylorMade clubs can be made for customers on the spot. 

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY 

The Company currently operates a golf facility called the &#8220;TaylorMade Golf Experience&#8221; (&#8220;TMGE&#8221;), formerly called the &#8220;Callaway Golf Center&#8221; &#8482;, on approximately forty-two (42) acres of land located on Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas, Nevada. The TMGE opened to the public on October 1, 1997. 

The TMGE is strategically positioned within a few miles of the largest hotels and casinos in the world. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Las Vegas had 42,312,216 visitors in 2015. There are 149,213 hotel rooms in Las Vegas and, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, eighteen of the top twenty-five largest hotels in the world are within five miles of the TMGE. They include the MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, and the City Center. The TMGE is also adjacent to McCarran International Airport, the 25 th busiest airport in the world with passenger traffic of 45,389,074 during 2015 according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The city of Las Vegas population is 619,419 while the Las Vegas valley (Clark County) residential population is 2,102,238. 

The TMGE includes a two tiered, 110-station, driving range. The driving range is designed to have the appearance of an actual golf course with ten impact greens and island greens. Pro-line equipment and popular brand name TaylorMade golf balls are utilized throughout the TMGE. In addition to the driving range, the TMGE has a lighted, nine-hole, par three golf course, named the &#8220;Divine Nine.&#8221; The golf course has been designed to be challenging, with golf cart paths and designated practice putting and chipping areas. At the entrance to the TMGE is a 20,000 square foot clubhouse which includes two advanced state of the art golf swing analyzing systems developed by TMaG, and two tenant operations: (a) the Saint Andrews Golf Shop featuring the latest in TaylorMade Adidas equipment and accessories, and (b) the Flight Deck Bar and Grill, which features an outdoor patio overlooking the golf course and driving range with the Las Vegas &#8220;Strip&#8221; in the background. 

The Company subleases space in the clubhouse to Saint Andrews. Base rent was initially $13,104 per month through July 2012 with a 5% increase for each of the two 5-year options to extend in July 2012 and July 2017. Saint Andrews exercised its first option to extend the lease through July 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized rental income totaling $166,779 and $163,800 respectively from this tenant. 

LIABILITY INSURANCE 

The Company has a comprehensive general liability insurance policy to cover possible claims for injury and damages from accidents and similar activities, with a limit of $2 million per occurrence, and an umbrella policy that provides an addition at $2 million per occurrence for any amounts that exceed the limits of the general liability policy. Although management of the Company believes that its insurance levels are sufficient to cover all future claims, there is no assurance it will be sufficient to cover all future claims. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

MARKETING 

The marketing program for the TMGE has a two-fold focus. The first is on local residents and the second is on tourists. The emphasis on the tourist market has been increasing because of the close proximity that TMGE has to the Las Vegas hotels located on the strip. In 2012 the Company hired a staff member to work as our &#8220;Director of Business&#8221; whose primary function was to network with hotel guests, hotel concierges, VIP hosts and groups visiting Las Vegas in order to bring more business to our facility. That position was vacated in October of 2013. In 2014 the Company hired a local golf expert, Brian Hurlburt, as a Marketing Consultant. During his tenure the TMGE rolled out a new website and added the ability to request event information through it as well as buy merchandise and apply for employment. The Company also has a taxi advertising program, advertising cards placed in hotel lobbies and rooms, and print media in local tourist publications. The TMGE's marketing efforts in the local resident market has principally relied on print media including the Las Vegas Review Journal, Seven Magazine and a taxicab publication. Also, the TMGE has implemented programs to attract more group events, clinics, and other special promotional events. A 30 foot high pylon sign with a reader board is located in front of the TMGE. The sign makes the general public aware of various programs, specials and information on events and other activities taking place within the TMGE. The TMGE has undertaken random surveys of its customers about how they heard about the TMGE. Over half of the customers stated that they came into the TMGE because they saw the sign. 

The TMGE, which includes a nine-hole par 3 golf course, driving range, and clubhouse, is designed to provide a country club atmosphere for the general public. 

The TMGE uses social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, and also uses its own website to keep guests abreast on specific events and current pricing. The TMGE also utilizes email blasts to its customer base. All of these help to keep the name of the TMGE before its guests and potential guests creatively. 

FIRST TEE PROGRAM 

Since March 2002, the golf center has been the official home in southern Nevada for the national First Tee program. The First Tee program is a national initiative started in November 1997 by the World Golf Foundation. First Tee is a program sponsored by the PGA Tour, the LPGA, the PGA of America, the United States Golf Association, and Augusta National Golf Club. The First Tee program was formed to eliminate access and affordability issues for children, especially economically disadvantaged children, to participate in the game of golf. In research conducted by the National Golf Foundation, it was noted that only two percent of children through age 17 ever try golf and only five percent of our nation&#8217;s golfers were minorities. The TMGE believes its participation in this program offers opportunities for greater public exposure. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

COMPETITION 

In the Las Vegas market, the Company has competition from other golf courses, family entertainment concerts, and entertainment provided by hotel/casinos. The Company&#8217;s management believes that the TMGE has a competitive advantage in the Las Vegas market because of its strategic location, product branding, alliances, and extent of facilities balanced with competitive pricing that is unlike any competitor in the market. 

The Company&#8217;s competition includes other golf facilities within the Las Vegas area that provide a golf course and driving range combination and/or a night lighted golf course. Management believes that the TMGE is able to compete because it is unique in providing a branded partnership with TaylorMade and giving the Las Vegas community one of the largest golf training facilities in the western United States. In addition, several Las Vegas hotel/casinos own their own golf courses that cater to high-roller/VIP tourists. The TMGE is able to compete against these facilities because it offers a competitively priced golf facility with close proximity to the Las Vegas &#8220;Strip&#8221; properties where a non-high-roller/VIP tourist can come to enjoy a Las Vegas golf experience. 

Top Golf, a national golf chain, has announced plans to move into the Las Vegas market with a facility scheduled to open in 2016. This would result in additional competition for the TMGE. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of March 7, 2016, there were 3 full-time and 2 part-time employees at the Company&#8217;s executive offices, and 4 full-time and 23 part-time employees at the TMGE.
