 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

&#160; National Beverage Corp. proudly refreshes America with a distinctive portfolio of Sparkling Waters, Juices, Energy Drinks and Carbonated Soft Drinks. We believe our ingenious product designs, innovative packaging and imaginative flavors, along with our corporate culture and philosophy, makes National Beverage unique in the beverage industry. The Company&#8217;s primary market focus is the United States, but our products are also distributed in various other countries. National Beverage Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991. In this report, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Company&#8221; and &#8220;National Beverage&#8221; mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise. 

&#160;

National Beverage is in an ongoing transition to meet the healthy hydration demands of the American consumer. Health and wellness awareness has increased significantly, resulting in growing demand for beverages with little or no calories and wholesome natural ingredients. Our brands emphasize distinctly-flavored beverages in attractive packaging that appeal to multiple demographic groups. The attentive, conscious and discriminating consumer is ever more alert to healthy choices and better-for-you ingredients that align to this transition and strategic focus. 

&#160;

We believe the combination of our business strategies and philosophies is key to greater competitive advantage and differentiation from competitors. Points of differentiation include the following:

&#160; 

Healthy Transformation &#8211; We focus on developing healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits. We are committed to tailoring the variety and types of beverages in our portfolio to satisfy the preferences of a diverse mix of &#8216;crossover consumers&#8217; &#8211; a growing group desiring a change to better-for-you beverages. 

&#160; 

F lavor Innovation &#8211; Throughout our product lines and brands, we emphasize distinctly flavored beverages. Building on a rich tradition of flavor and brand innovation with over a 125 year history of development with iconic brands such as Shasta&#174; and Faygo&#174;, we consider ourselves a leader in flavor and essence technology. Proprietary flavors and essences are developed and tested in-house and only made commercially available after extensive concept and sensory evaluation. Our variety of flavors provides us a unique advantage with today&#8217;s consumers who demand variety and refreshing beverage alternatives. 

&#160; &#160;

Quality Ethic &#8211; We believe consumers demand quality, and we are committed to producing and developing products of the highest quality that also appeal to the value expectations of the consumer. We believe we can leverage our efficient production and distribution systems, and our cost-effective social media and regionally focused marketing programs, to profitably deliver products at optimal consumer price-points. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Creative Dynamics &#8211; In a beverage industry that is dominated by the &#8220;cola giants&#8221;, we pride ourselves on our ability to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than competitors who are burdened by production and distribution complexity as well as legacy costs. The ability to identify consumer trends and create new product concepts to lead the market defines our new product development model. Speed to market with the right concept, unique flavor creation and trend forward &#8216;better-for-you&#8217; continues to be our goal. As with flavor development, internal development teams are responsible for concept creation, packaging and design, which allows for rapid &#8216;go to market&#8217; timing and reduced development costs. 

&#160; &#160;

We believe our unique brands and speed-to-market are key factors to our success. 

&#160;

Power+ Brands &#8211;

&#160; 

&#160;

Carbonated Soft Drinks &#8211; 

&#160; 

&#160; More than 125 years old , Shasta is recognized as a bottling industry pioneer and innovator. Shasta features multiple flavors, including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets, and continues to earn consumer loyalty by delivering value, convenience and such unique tastes as California Dreamin&#8217;, Very Cherry Twist and Fiesta Punch. 

&#160; 

More than 100 years old, Faygo products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including Red Pop&#174;, Moon Mist&#174;, and Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Rye&#174;. We also produce and market Ritz &#174; soft drinks and seltzers, primarily in the southeastern U.S., distribute Big Shot &#174; in New Orleans and surrounding areas, and offer St. Nick&#8217;s &#174; soft drinks during the holiday season. During recent years, we reformulated many of our brands to reduce the caloric content while still preserving their time-tested flavor profiles. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Although typical cola drinks account for approximately 48% of the soft drink industry&#8217;s domestic grocery channel volume, colas account for less than 15% of our total volume. We tailor our marketing and promotion programs by locale; many of our carbonated soft drink brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and make them less vulnerable to competitive substitution. In addition, products produced locally often generate more aggressive retailer-sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.

&#160; 

&#160;

Our brands, optically and ingredient-wise, are always a work in process. We are continually striving to make all our soft drinks healthier beverages while still maintaining their iconic taste profiles. As often as innovation develops, we endeavor to significantly improve our products, always seeking quality and authenticity over cost. 

&#160;

PRODUCTION 

&#160; 

We employ a philosophy that emphasizes vertical integration; our production model integrates the procurement of raw materials and crafting of concentrates with the production of finished products. Our twelve strategically located production facilities are near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States. The locations of our facilities enable us to efficiently produce and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas. Each facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes. We utilize numerous package types and sizes, including cans ranging from eight to sixteen ounces and bottles ranging from ten ounces to three liters. 

&#160; 

We believe that the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our bottling facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely upon independent third party bottlers to manufacture and market their products. Since we control the national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage product quality and customer service and respond quickly to changing market conditions. 

&#160; 

We produce a substantial portion of the flavor concentrates used in our branded products. By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we can craft our products in accordance with uniform quality standards while tailoring flavors to regional taste preferences. We believe that the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers. We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations. These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors. 

&#160; 

DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers, as well as thousands of smaller &#8220;up-and-down-the-street&#8221; accounts, we utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service. 

&#160; 

The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, warehouse clubs, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers and dollar stores. We distribute our products to this channel through the warehouse distribution system and the direct-store delivery system. Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our production facilities to the retailer&#8217;s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its outlet locations with other goods. Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer&#8217;s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors. 

&#160; 

We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors. The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller &#8220;up-and-down-the-street&#8221; accounts. Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken several measures to expand convenience channel distribution. These include development of products, packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers. Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers. 

&#160; 

Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands. We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers. We believe vending and cooler equipment increases beverage sales, enhances brand awareness and develops brand loyalty. 

&#160; 

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160; 

We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks. Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines. We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets. 

&#160; 

The emphasis of our sales and marketing programs is to maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty, typically through a combination of regional advertising, special event marketing, endorsements, sponsorships and social media, along with consumer coupon distribution and product sampling. We retain agencies to assist with social media engagement and advertising programs for our brands. Additionally, we offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, in-store advertising materials and other incentives. These elements allow tailored marketing and advertising programs to meet local and regional economic conditions and demographics. Additionally, we sponsor special holiday promotions which feature St. Nick&#8217;s soft drinks and special holiday flavors and packaging. 

&#160; 

In recent years, we&#8217;ve expanded our programs to reach consumers directly through innovative digital marketing, social media engagement and content creation. We are focused on increasing our digital presence and capabilities to further enhance the consumer experience across our brands. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of raw materials and packaging goods. By consolidating the purchasing function for our production facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as a low-cost producer of beverages. 

&#160; 

The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including sweeteners, juice and flavor concentrates, carbon dioxide, water, glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans, paper, cartons and closures. Most of our low-calorie soft drink products use sucralose, aspartame, stevia or acesulfame potassium. We craft a substantial portion of our flavor concentrates and purchase remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials. A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities. Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

The majority of our sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer and warmer months. Additionally, our sales can be influenced by weather conditions. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position varies in each of our market areas. Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including soft drinks, water products, juices, fruit drinks, powdered drinks, coffees, teas, energy drinks, sports drinks, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages. We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products. Several competitors, including the two that dominate the soft drink industry, PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products can adversely affect sales of our brands. Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods. We believe our Company differentiates itself through a diversified product portfolio, strong brand recognition, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, focused advertising and social media, and, for some product lines, value pricing. 

&#160; &#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business. We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation. 

&#160; 

Certain states and localities require a deposit or tax on the sale of certain beverages. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position. We believe that our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law. Compliance with or violation of any current or future regulations and legislation could require material expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of April 30, 2016, we employed approximately 1,200 people, of which approximately 300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.
