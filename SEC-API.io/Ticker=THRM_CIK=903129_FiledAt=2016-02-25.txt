Research and Development 

Our research and development activities are an essential part of our efforts to develop new, innovative products and introduce them to the market. Through both internal and external research and development programs, we are working to develop a comprehensive knowledge of thermal management systems and demonstrate functionality and performance. These activities are critical to optimizing energy and production efficiencies and to improving effectiveness in our products, making them less complex, easier to package and less expensive to manufacture and install. 

We perform advanced research and development on thermal management systems, including the development and testing of new materials, to achieve increased efficiency and reliability. We engineer new applications of our existing products in order to meet 

&#160;

design criteria of a particular customer&#8217;s needs. We believe there are substantial prospects for the design and development of innovative thermal management systems in applications outside of the industries served by our current product lines. 

Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. These expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials and services associated with particular engineering activities, net of reimbursements from customers and research sponsors. Any related reimbursements for costs, whether for advanced research or a specific product application, are accounted for as a reduction of research and development expense. 

Research and development is conducted at our global headquarters in Northville, Michigan, our advance materials research facilities in Azusa, California, our European research facility in Odelzhausen, Germany, our industrial application research facility in Calgary, Canada and our electronics design and advanced testing facility in Shanghai, China. We are currently relocating and expanding our North American test facility to improve our ability to test and showcase product capabilities to potential customers. Additional product development is performed at all of our manufacturing facilities to support customers. We believe the localized development model employed at our global design and manufacturing facilities improves our ability to effectively serve our customers and increases our innovative capacity in the future.

Net research and development expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $59,604,000, $57,526,000, and $49,873,000, respectively. Because of changing levels of research and development activity, our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period. 

Technologies

Gentherm&#8217;s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects and managing the thermal energy conversion to electrical energy. 

Thermoelectric Technologies

Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device (&#8220;TED&#8221;) technology. A TED is a solid state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. For the last 15 years, our work on this technology has yielded great improvements in areas of efficiency, durability and performance. 

Thermoelectric generator (&#8220;TEG&#8221;) technologies have the reciprocal capability to the Peltier effect, known as the Seebeck effect, whereby thermal energy is converted into electrical power. Our current research and development activities are concentrated on improving the efficiency of this process, by improving design and adapting new materials that are better suited for TEG commercialization. These efforts, together with previously sponsored research which focused on the recovery of waste heat from vehicle exhaust and other sources, has led us to introduce this technology to certain specialty markets. 

Resistive Heaters

Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (&#8220;PTC&#8221;) heating elements which quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex TM or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application.

Electronics

Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core thermal seat comfort, interior comfort and thermal convenience products. We also supply electronics for products outside this core set and are looking to supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior. Our electronics will also be incorporated into consumer and commercial products currently under development.

Automotive Cable Systems 

Gentherm produces automotive cable systems to be used to connect automotive components to sources of power. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of virtually all of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors. Our cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Sales of products that utilize 

&#160;

our automotive cable systems technology represent 10%, 10% and 12% of our total product revenues for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Air Moving Devices

Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. Production of air moving devices is an example of our expanding manufacturing capabilities and is an important step toward our goal of becoming a full service provider of sub-systems.

Products 

Seat Comfort 

Climate Control Seats 

Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device.

A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products substantially improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger. A heated and ventilated only variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, the vent only system is supplemented with resistive heating elements. 

Heated and ventilated CCS products have a lower price and have versatile cooling capability targeted for certain lower cost vehicle models, geographical markets and customers who prefer the heated and ventilated product. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 47%, 45% and 40% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Since each vehicle model&#8217;s seats are different, we must tailor the CCS components to match each seat design. Since we first developed the CCS in the late 1990&#8217;s, we have supplied prototype seats containing our CCS product to virtually every major automobile manufacturer and seat supplier. If a manufacturer wishes to integrate our CCS product into a seat, it provides us with automotive seats to be modified so that we can install a unit in a prototype. The seat is then returned to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacturer accepts our CCS product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include our CCS product in a vehicle model to actual volume production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. 

Heated Seats 

Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 32%, 37% and 43% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our heated seat revenue has grown in absolute dollars during each of the last three years but is declining as a percent of our overall product revenue as more customers choose to install CCS systems in their vehicles. 

Battery Thermal Management (&#8220;BTM&#8221;) 

Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries. The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as 48V electrical networks, start-stop systems, regenerative braking systems and other micro-hybrid battery implementations, have drastically increased the demand for BTM systems solutions which enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery. Gentherm&#8217;s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, 

&#160;

making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm&#8217;s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy budget for an electrified vehicle. The performance improve ments realized with this product have been validated through the award of production BTM systems by two flagship OEMs. We are currently working with other OEMs in an effort to secure more production contracts. 

Remote Power Generation 

Gentherm is the world&#8217;s leading provider of remote electric power generation systems, primarily serving large upstream and midstream oil and gas markets. Using our unique industrial TEG technologies, our generation systems deliver ultra-reliable power for long-term unattended operation in geographically remote applications that are critical to our customers&#8217; operations, such as wellhead automation, valve automation and cathodic protection of pipelines. We design and produce turnkey systems that are highly customized for application, load, power and fuel source, and location requirements. Other applications for our remote power generation systems include mobile telecommunications, security and surveillance and scientific monitoring. Revenues from the sale of remote power generation systems are reported within the industrial segment. Our revenues from this product include large custom systems projects ranging from $200,000 to over $2,000,000. While this revenue is generally growing, quarterly results can vary significantly due to delivery timing of these custom systems to customers.

Thermal Convenience 

Heated and Cooled Cup Holder 

The heated and cooled cup holder applies Gentherm&#8217;s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage. Over the past year we have improved the technology in this product resulting in reduced noise and power consumption and improved heating and cooling. The heated and cooled cupholder will launch on several new vehicle platforms during the next three years. 

Thermal Storage Bin

Gentherm&#8217;s newest thermal convenience product is our thermal storage bin designed for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market. Using patented TED and other key technologies, the thermal storage bin provides temperature control independently from a vehicle&#8217;s heating and air conditioning system. The thermal storage bin can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers. The thermal storage bin is available in the front floor console of several large SUV vehicles produced by a major North American Automotive manufacturer. We are currently working with other automotive manufactures to develop and integrate thermal storage bins in their vehicles.

Interior Comfort 

Heated Steering Wheel

Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive wire elements, similar to those used in our seat heater products. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. 

Heated Door and Armrest 

Gentherm&#8217;s thermally conductive door panel armrest and center console armrest are powered by technologies used in our advanced seat heating products. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discreetly located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests are a perfect complement to our climate controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. 

Heated and Cooled Mattress 

Our heated and cooled mattress incorporates our proprietary Climate Control Sleep System&#8482; (&#8220;CCSS&#8221;) technology. The CCSS represents an adaptation of the TED technology in our active CCS system. The CCSS directs warmed or cooled air to the surface of a mattress through our proprietary air distribution system. Two independently controlled temperature zones have their own heat or cool settings for a personalized microclimate sleep environment. There are five available settings in each of the heat and cool modes as well as an ambient setting. The sleep system uses a Master Control Unit or hand-held remote controls. Integration solutions exist for 

&#160;

foam, innerspring and air bed mattresses and we continue to work with mattress manufacturers and retailers to bring CCSS technology t o markets around the world. Mattress Firm, the nation&#8217;s largest mattress retailer, launched the Atmos Sleep System in select test markets during the spring of 2015, with plans for a national roll-out in 2016. In addition, Gentherm continues development of the next generation sleep system products, complementary accessories and new channel partners. 

Sponsored Research 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Gentherm was selected by the U.S. Navy to lead the development of an energy efficient, portable patient warming system based on proprietary thermal management technologies. The objectives for the program include improving the current standard of care for patient warming in support of expeditionary health services and advanced medical development. The patient warming system is intended to be compatible with existing medical care systems and be used for treating patients in field hospitals or in transport by ground, ship or air to traditional, better-equipped treatment centers. Our approach, which is based on new research, leverages the body&#8217;s natural methods for thermal exchange and temperature management. The two-year, $2.75 million project will be fully funded by the U.S. Navy. Total funding received from this program during 2015 was $140,000. 

Marketing, Customers and Sales 

We supply automobile and light truck manufacturers with products from our seat comfort and interior comfort businesses, as well as products which utilize our automotive cable system and electronics technology. Our power generation systems are applied to oil and gas customers for cathodic pipeline protection and other remote applications around the world. We supply heated and cooled mattresses to the largest mattress and specialty bed retailer in North America. We also directly supply CCS and seat heaters to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. 

Our marketing efforts, focused primarily on automotive manufacturers and their first-tier suppliers, explain that our products represent an attractive feature that will be embraced by consumers and have favorable economics, including high profitability, to these customers. If interested, the manufacturers then direct us to work with their suppliers who then become our direct customers by incorporating our products into their designs. As automobile products comprise a majority of our current revenue, the volume of products we sell is directly affected by the levels of new vehicle sales and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. 

Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. This is due in part to automotive manufacturers requiring the design, coordination and testing of proposed new components and sub-systems. Revenues from these expenditures are typically not realized for two to three years due to this development cycle. These customers in turn sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. 

For our most recent fiscal year, our revenues from sales to our three largest customers, Johnson Controls, Lear Corporation and Bosch Automotive were $193,381,000, $192,335,000, and $74,736,000, respectively, representing 23%, 22%, and 9% of our total revenues, respectively. Revenues from Johnson Controls and Lear Corporation represent sales of our seat comfort, thermal convenience and interior comfort products. Revenues from Bosch represent product sales based on our automobile cable system technology and are used primarily in the production of automotive oxygen sensors. The loss of any one of these customers is likely to have a material adverse impact on our business; however, as noted above, our strategy is to market our seat comfort products to the OEMs who then direct their suppliers, such as Johnson Controls and Lear Corporation, to work with us. Therefore it is relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. 

&#160;

Our revenues for each of the past three years were divide d among automotive OEMs as follows:

Outsourcing, Production and Suppliers 

Our global manufacturing facilities are located close to our key customers. Our European manufacturing operations are located at our Hungarian, Macedonian and Ukrainian sites. In North America, we operate two manufacturing production sites in Acu&#241;a, Mexico and one in Alberta, Canada. A new manufacturing facility in Celaya, Mexico is expected to open in the third quarter of 2016. In Asia, we operate production facilities in Langfang, China, and Ha Nam, Vietnam and an electronics production facility in Shenzhen, China. We continue to grow our in-house manufacturing capabilities, reducing the number of components outsourced to contract manufacturers. 

We rely on various vendors and suppliers to supply components for our products through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Components for certain products, including TEDs, are only available from a limited number of suppliers in the world. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows. Our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by delays in deliveries from our suppliers. 

Proprietary Rights and Patents 

The development of new technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. 

As of December 31, 2015, Gentherm held 471 issued patents, of which 197 were U.S. patents and 274 were non-U.S. patents. A total of 24 patents were held jointly with other companies. Gentherm held 343 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies, 100 patents directed at heating elements and technologies and 28 patents directed to air moving devices.

We are actively involved in on-going patent infringement actions. During the year, we wrote-off $317,000 related to patents because certain claims made under specific previously issued patents we own were determined to be unpatentable retroactively by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We determined, however, that the loss of this patent protection did not cause a significant change in our projected future cash flows, and therefore determined that no other assets were impaired due to the ruling. 

&#160;

Competition 

The automotive components and systems business is highly competitive. We have several important competitors in the heated seat business and certain vehicle manufacturers have, for some time, offered options on certain models that combine heated seats with circulation of ambient air or cooled air from the car&#8217;s air conditioning system which works similar to our heated and ventilated seat system products. It is possible that our competitors will be able to expand or modify their current products to more directly compete with our CCS products. We believe that there are other potential competitors that are working to develop systems for heating and cooling of automotive car seats. 

We may experience additional competition directly from automobile manufacturers or other major suppliers, most of which have the capability to manufacture competing products. We believe that our products will compete successfully on the basis of performance, quality, and price.

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for further information regarding the significant competition in the automotive industry.

Our power generation systems compete with other technologies, such as photovoltaic solar panels, and fuel cells, to deliver power to different types of oil and gas market applications. Our products have earned a reputation for delivering highly reliable power under extreme climatic and weather conditions to locations that do not offer access to an electrical grid. In addition to quality and performance, our ability to design and support custom solutions that integrate directly with an application&#8217;s existing infrastructure give our products a competitive advantage over products based on other technologies.

Risk Attendant to Foreign Operations

We internally manufacture the majority of our products at our production facilities in foreign countries. Other products we sell are manufactured by third parties in foreign countries. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations.

See Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company&#8217;s segment revenues by geographic composition.

Seasonality 

Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. See Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for selected quarterly financial data. &#160;
