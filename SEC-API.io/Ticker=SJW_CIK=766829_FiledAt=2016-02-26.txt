Business 

General Development of Business 

SJW Corp. was incorporated in California on February 8, 1985. SJW Corp. is a holding company with five subsidiaries: 

&#8226; 

San Jose Water Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., with its headquarters located at 110 West Taylor Street in San Jose, California 95110, was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1866. As part of a reorganization on February 8, 1985, San Jose Water Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp. San Jose Water Company is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 229,000 &#32;connections that serve a population of approximately one million &#32;people in an area comprising approximately 138 &#32;square miles in the metropolitan San Jose, California area. 

&#8226; 

SJWTX, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., was incorporated in the State of Texas in 2005. SJWTX, Inc. is doing business as Canyon Lake Water Service Company (&#8220;CLWSC&#8221;). CLWSC is a public utility in the business of providing water service to approximately 12,500 &#32;connections that serve approximately 37,000 &#32;people. CLWSC's service area comprises more than 243 &#32;square miles in western Comal County and southern Blanco County in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. SJWTX, Inc. has a 25% interest in Acequia Water Supply Corporation (&#8220;Acequia&#8221;). The water supply corporation has been determined to be a variable interest entity within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 810&#8212;&#8220;Consolidation&#8221; with SJWTX, Inc. as the primary beneficiary. As a result, Acequia has been consolidated with SJWTX, Inc. 

&#8226; 

SJW Land Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., was incorporated in 1985. SJW Land Company owns undeveloped land in the states of California and Tennessee, owns and operates commercial buildings in the states of California, Arizona and Tennessee, and has a 70% limited partnership interest in 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P. 

&#8226; 

Texas Water Alliance Limited (&#8220;TWA&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW Corp., is undertaking activities that are necessary to develop a water supply project in Texas. On February 22, 2016, SJW Corp. entered into an agreement with the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (&#8220;GBRA&#8221;), pursuant to which SJW Corp. agreed to sell all of its equity interest in TWA to GBRA for $31.0 million in cash (the &#8220;TWA Agreement&#8221;). The TWA Agreement is subject to specified closing conditions, including the completion of a financing by GBRA to fund the purchase price. 

&#8226; 

SJW Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 2015 for the sole purpose of effectuating a change in the state of incorporation of SJW Corp. from California to Delaware (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;). The Reincorporation requires the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;CPUC&#8221;) and Public Utilities Commission of Texas (&#8220;PUCT&#8221;) and will not become effective until after we obtain such approvals. In July and September 2015, applications were filed with the CPUC and PUCT, respectively, to seek such approvals and decisions are expected in the first quarter of 2016. &#32; 

Together, San Jose Water Company, CLWSC and TWA are referred to as &#8220;Water Utility Services.&#8221; 

&#32;3 

SJW Land Company and its consolidated variable interest entity, 444 West Santa Clara Street, L.P., which operates commercial building rentals, are collectively referred to as &#8220;Real Estate Services.&#8221; 

Regulation and Rates 

San Jose Water Company's rates, service and other matters affecting its business are subject to regulation by the CPUC. 

Generally, there are three types of rate adjustments that affect San Jose Water Company's revenue collection: general rate adjustments, cost of capital adjustments, and offset rate adjustments. General rate adjustments are authorized in general rate case decisions, which usually authorize an initial rate adjustment followed by two annual escalation adjustments. General rate applications are normally filed and processed during the last year covered by the most recent general rate case as required by the CPUC in order to avoid any gaps in regulatory decisions on general rate adjustments. 

Cost of capital adjustments are rate adjustments resulting from the CPUC's usual tri-annual establishment of a reasonable rate of return for San Jose Water Company's capital investments. 

The purpose of an offset rate adjustment is to compensate utilities for changes in specific pre-authorized offsettable capital investments or expenses, primarily for purchased water, groundwater extraction charges and purchased power. Pursuant to Section 792.5 of the California Public Utilities Code, a balancing account must be maintained for each expense item for which such revenue offsets have been authorized. The purpose of a balancing account is to track the under-collection or over-collection associated with such expense changes. 

On September 15, 2014, San Jose Water Company filed an application for rehearing of 2012 General Rate Case Decision No. 14-08-006 to address a limited set of issues from San Jose Water Company's General Rate Case Decision No. 14-08-006. Specifically, San Jose Water Company sought rehearing on the duration of the interim rate period used to determine the General Rate Case true-up recovery and rehearing on the treatment of excess capacity labor in the provision of non-tariffed products and services. On March 27, 2015, the CPUC issued Decision No. 15-03-048 granting a limited rehearing and modifying Decision No. 14-08-006 to recover over 12 months lost revenue in the amount of $1.9 million &#32;related to the extension of interim rates from the date of the 2012 General Rate Case Decision (August 14, 2014) to the date 2014 rates became effective (September 29, 2014). Decision No. 15-03-048 also provided for a limited rehearing on the treatment of excess capacity labor in the provision of non-tariffed products and services. On August 13, 2015, San Jose Water Company and the CPUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates (&#8220;ORA&#8221;) submitted a settlement that resolved all outstanding issues related to the rehearing. On October 1, 2015, the CPUC issued Decision No. 15-10-005 adopting the submitted settlement and closed the proceeding. The settlement agreement did not affect authorized revenues or rates. 

On January 5, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed General Rate Case Application No. 15-01-002 requesting authority for an increase of revenue of $34.9 million , or 12.22% , in 2016, $10.0 million , or 3.11% , in 2017 and $17.6 million , or 5.36% , in 2018. This General Rate Case filing also includes several requests, including but not limited to: (1) recovery of the under-collected balance of $4.8 million &#32;in balancing accounts, (2) disbursement of the over-collected balance of $976 thousand &#32;accrued in various memorandum accounts, and (3) implementation of a full revenue decoupling Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism and associated Modified Cost Balancing Account. The ORA submitted testimony on April 23, 2015, recommending increases of $23.5 million , or 8.54% , in 2016, $13.8 million , or 4.42% , in 2017 and $16.3 million , or 4.95% &#32;in 2018. San Jose Water Company and the ORA reached a settlement agreement on a range of issues, including full settlement on all contested utility plant in-service items. Evidentiary hearings to address all remaining unsettled items took place in June 2015 and briefs were submitted in July 2015. Since a decision was not reached by the end of 2015, the CPUC has authorized San Jose Water Company to implement interim rates, effective January 1, 2016, until such time as decision is adopted. Interim rates have been set equal to calendar year-end 2015 rates and will remain in effect until a decision is adopted. Any difference between interim rates and the rates ultimately approved will be tracked in a memorandum account and will be submitted to the CPUC for recovery or refund. A final General Rate Case is expected in the first half of 2016. 

On March 26, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 468 with the CPUC. With this advice letter San Jose Water Company requested authorization to recover an under-collection balance of $9.6 million &#32;in the Mandatory Conservation Revenue Adjustment Memorandum Account (&#8220;MCRAMA&#8221;), using a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (&#8220;WRAM&#8221;) methodology, that accumulated during the period April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. On December 3, 2015, the CPUC adopted Resolution W-5071. The resolution authorized recovery of $4.3 million &#32;in lost revenues based on the use of a Water Conservation Memorandum Account (&#8220;WCMA&#8221;) calculation methodology. The WCMA calculation methodology allows San Jose Water Company to track lost revenue associated with reduced sales due to the ongoing drought and the associated calls for water use reduction from the Santa Clara Valley Water District (&#8220;SCVWD&#8221;). The lost revenues are to be recovered over a 12-month period via a surcharge of $0.08 &#32;per hundred cubic feet (&#8220;CCF&#8221;) beginning December 9, 2015. The MCRAMA was subsequently renamed the WCMA in Advice Letter No. 479. See &#8220;Balancing and Memorandum Accounts&#8221; under Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on recognition of the approved recovery amount. 

&#32;4 

On May 1, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 471 with the CPUC requesting to recover the cumulative balance of $1.9 million &#32;in the 2013 General Rate Case Interim Rates Memorandum Account for the period of August 15, 2014 through September 28, 2014. The recovery of the balance for this 45-day period was authorized in the GRC rehearing Decision No. 15-03-048. San Jose Water Company's request was authorized effective May 6, 2015. 

On May 11, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letters No. 472 and No. 473 with the CPUC. With Advice Letter No. 472, San Jose Water Company sought to modify the existing Water Shortage Contingency Plan in Tariff Rule 14.1, so that the plan reflects examples put forward by the CPUC and so that the restrictions provided within the plan more closely matched the restrictions adopted by local government agencies. Advice Letter No. 473 was filed pursuant to Executive Order B-29-15 by the Governor of the State of California, and by orders of the State Water Resources Control Board (&#8220;State Water Board&#8221;) and the CPUC. With Advice Letter No. 473, San Jose Water Company requested authority from the CPUC to activate Stage 3 of Tariff Rule 14.1 and activate the Water Shortage Contingency Plan in Schedule No. 14.1 with staged mandatory reductions in water usage and drought surcharges. Both Advice Letters No. 472 and No. 473 became effective on June 15, 2015. The drought surcharges will be recorded in a drought account authorized by the CPUC to track lost revenues from conservation. The amount collected will offset future rate increases that would be necessary to recover lost revenue due to drought conservation efforts. 

On May 29, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 474 with the CPUC requesting authorization to increase revenues by $18.4 million , or approximately 6.44% . This filing covered increased costs that went into effect on July 1, 2015 for purchased water and groundwater production charged to San Jose Water Company by the SCVWD. As directed by the CPUC's Water Division, the revenue increase is recovered via surcharges on the existing quantity rate. San Jose Water Company's request was authorized and became effective July 1, 2015. 

On July 30, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Application No. 15-07-027 with the CPUC seeking the authorization to change the state of incorporation of SJW Corp., the parent holding company of San Jose Water Company, from California to Delaware. A decision in this matter is anticipated in the first quarter of 2016. 

On August 21, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Application No. 15-08-016 with the CPUC seeking authority to issue additional debt and equity securities of up to $150 million &#32;in aggregate for general purposes including property acquisition, construction, completion, extension or improvement of facilities. On December 18, 2015, the CPUC issued Decision No. 15-12-018 authorizing San Jose Water Company to issue the requested debt and equity securities. 

On August 21, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter 476 with the CPUC. San Jose Water Company requested authorization for a rate base offset for improvements to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant. In Decision No. 13-07-028 the CPUC authorized San Jose Water Company to file annual advice letters to include in rate base costs of the Montevina Water Treatment Plant upgrade project. The advice letter filing requested authorization for a revenue increase of approximately $275 thousand &#32;or about 0.09% . The advice letter was approved and the increase in rates became effective September 20, 2015. Revenue will be recorded through rates on a prospective basis. This filing was the second such advice letter related to the Montevina Water Treatment Plant. San Jose Water Company intends to continue to file similar annual advice letters until the project has been completed. 

On December 11, 2015, San Jose Water Company along with three other California water utilities (the &#8220;Joint Parties&#8221;), filed a request for a one year postponement of their 2016 Cost of Capital (&#8220;COC&#8221;) filings scheduled for March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the CPUC's rate case plan, the Joint Parties are required to file their COC applications on a triennial basis with the next scheduled filing due on March 31, 2016. Postponing the filing for one year would alleviate administrative processing costs on the Joint Parties as well as the CPUC staff. On February 1, 2016, the CPUC's executive director approved the Joint Parties request for a one year postponement. Joint Parties are now required to file their next COC applications on March 31, 2017. 

On December 15, 2015, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 481 with the CPUC requesting authorization to re-implement a previously existing surcharge of $0.0492 &#32;per CCF to amortize the remaining uncollected balancing account recovery authorized in General Rate Case Decision 14-08-006. In Decision No. 14-08-006 the CPUC authorized San Jose Water Company to recover the $2.6 million &#32;under-collection in various balancing accounts over a 12-month period beginning in August of 2014. However, at the end of the 12-month period $590 thousand &#32;of the originally authorized $2.6 million &#32;remained uncollected. This under-collection is due primarily to actual sales being substantially lower than the commission authorized sales estimate which was used to calculate the surcharge level. The advice letter was approved and effective on January 15, 2016. 

On February 5, 2016, San Jose Water Company filed Advice Letter No. 482 with the CPUC. With this advice letter San Jose Water Company requested authorization to recover the $7.7 million &#32;balance accumulated in the WCMA during the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The WCMA is used to track the revenue impact of mandatory conservation upon 

&#32;5 

San Jose Water Company&#8217;s quantity revenue resulting from mandatory conservation instituted by the State of California and the SCVWD. The requested $7.7 million &#32;recovery is the net amount of the total drought related revenue reduction calculated in the WCMA offset by the drought surcharges collected during 2015. If approved, the under-collection will be recovered via a surcharge of $0.1441 &#32;per CCF on the existing quantity rate for a period of 12 months from the date of CPUC approval. San Jose Water Company has requested the recovery begin on or about April 7, 2016. 

Effective September 1, 2014, CLWSC became subject to the economic regulation of the PUCT. Prior to that time, CLWSC was subject to economic regulation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;). Both the PUCT and TCEQ authorize rate increases after the filing of an Application for a Rate/Tariff Change. Rate cases may be filed as they become necessary, provided there is no current rate case outstanding. Further, rate cases may not be filed more frequently than once every 12 months. 

On September 16, 2015, CLWSC filed an application with the PUCT requesting approval of the reincorporation of SJW Corp., Inc. from a California corporation to a Delaware corporation. The application is currently being reviewed by PUCT and a decision in this matter is anticipated in the first quarter of 2016.

Financial Information about Industry Segments 

See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding SJW Corp.'s business segments. 

Description of Business 

General 

The principal business of Water Utility Services consists of the production, purchase, storage, purification, distribution, wholesale, and retail sale of water. San Jose Water Company provides water service to approximately 229,000 &#32;connections that serve customers in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno, Saratoga and the Town of Los Gatos, and adjacent unincorporated territories, all in the County of Santa Clara in the State of California. San Jose Water Company distributes water to customers in accordance with accepted water utility methods. CLWSC provides water service to approximately 12,500 &#32;connections that serve approximately 37,000 &#32;people in a service area comprising more than 243 &#32;square miles in the growing region between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. TWA has entered into arrangements with certain landowners in Gonzales County, Texas that provide for the development of a water supply project. In connection with the project, TWA applied for groundwater production and transportation permits to meet the future water needs in CLWSC's service area and to the central Texas hill country communities and utilities adjacent to this area. In January of 2013, TWA's permits were approved by the groundwater district in Gonzales County. The permits were subsequently received in March 2013. 

San Jose Water Company also provides non-tariffed services under agreements with municipalities and other utilities. These non-tariffed services include water system operations, maintenance agreements and antenna leases. 

In October 1997, San Jose Water Company commenced operation of the City of Cupertino municipal water system under the terms of a 25-year lease. The system is adjacent to the San Jose Water Company service area and has approximately 4,600 service connections. Under the terms of the lease, San Jose Water Company paid an up-front $6.8 million concession fee to the City of Cupertino that is amortized over the contract term. San Jose Water Company assumed responsibility for all maintenance and operating costs, while receiving all payments for water service. 

Among other things, operating results from the water business fluctuate according to the demand for water, which is often influenced by seasonal conditions, such as summer temperatures or the amount and timing of precipitation in Water Utility Services' service areas. Revenue, production expenses and income are affected by changes in water sales and the availability of surface water supply. Overhead costs, such as payroll and benefits, depreciation, interest on long-term debt, and property taxes, remain fairly constant despite variations in the amount of water sold. As a result, earnings are highest in the higher demand, warm summer months and lowest in the lower demand, cool winter months. 

&#32;6 

Water Supply 

San Jose Water Company's water supply consists of groundwater from wells, surface water from watershed run-off and diversion, reclaimed water, and imported water purchased from the SCVWD under the terms of a master contract with SCVWD expiring in 2051. Purchased water provides approximately 40% to 50% of San Jose Water Company's annual production. San Jose Water Company pumps approximately 40% to 50% of its water supply from the underground basin and pays a groundwater extraction charge to SCVWD. Surface supply, which during a year of normal rainfall satisfies about 6% to 8% of San Jose Water Company's annual needs, provides approximately 1% of its water supply in a dry year and approximately 14% in a wet year. In dry years, the decrease in water from surface run-off and diversion, and the corresponding increase in purchased and pumped water, increases production expenses substantially. 

The pumps and motors at San Jose Water Company's groundwater production facilities are propelled by electric power. Over the last few years, San Jose Water Company has installed standby power generators at 33 of its strategic water production sites. In addition, the commercial office and operations control centers are outfitted with standby power equipment that allow critical distribution and customer service operations to continue during a power outage. SCVWD has informed San Jose Water Company that its filter plants, which deliver purchased water to San Jose Water Company, are also equipped with standby generators. In the event of a power outage, San Jose Water Company believes it will be able to prevent an interruption of service to customers for a limited period by pumping water with its standby generators and by using purchased water from SCVWD. 

In 2015, the level of water in the Santa Clara Valley groundwater basin, which is managed by the SCVWD, experienced a slight recovery due to: (1) a reduction in groundwater pumping by various water retailers in the region, and (2) a modest increase in groundwater recharge efforts on the part of the SCVWD. As reported by the SCVWD at the end of 2015, groundwater level in the Santa Clara Plain was slightly higher compared to the same time in 2014, but lower than the five-year average and the total groundwater storage at the end of 2015 was within Stage 3 (Severe) of the SCVWD's Water Shortage Contingency Plan. On January 8, 2016, SCVWD's 10 reservoirs were 31.3% full with 52,862 acre-feet of water in storage. As of December 31, 2015, San Jose Water Company's Lake Elsman contained 571 acre-feet or approximately 36% of the five-year seasonal average. In addition, the rainfall at San Jose Water Company's Lake Elsman was measured at 9.35 inches for the period from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, which is 55% of the five-year average. Local surface water is a less costly source of water than groundwater or purchased water and its availability significantly impacts San Jose Water Company's results of operations. San Jose Water Company believes that its various sources of water supply will be sufficient to meet customer demand in 2016 after consideration of implemented water restrictions and conservation activities in response to the continuing drought. 

In response to the ongoing drought in California, on March 17, 2015, the State Water Board adopted an expanded emergency conservation regulation that became effective on March 27, 2015. The regulation prohibits certain outdoor water uses for all Californians and also places water usage restrictions on businesses in the restaurant and hospitality sectors. On March 25, 2015, SCVWD increased their conservation target from 20% &#32;to 30% &#32;through the end of 2015. On April 1, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued an executive order imposing restrictions to achieve a statewide 25% &#32;reduction in potable urban water usage through February 28, 2016 based on 2013 usage. On November 13, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown issued Executive Order B-36-15 that calls for an extension of restrictions on urban potable water usage until October 31, 2016, should drought conditions persist through January of 2016. On February 2, 2016, the State Water Board approved a resolution to extend the existing emergency conservation regulation as directed in the November 2015 executive order. &#32; 

On April 9, 2015, CPUC issued a resolution ordering its regulated water utilities to comply with the State Water Board's emergency conservation regulation, conduct additional customer outreach and implement restrictions on outdoor water use. Effective June 15, 2015, San Jose Water Company was authorized by the CPUC to activate Stage 3 of Tariff Rule 14.1 which is a water shortage contingency plan with mandatory water usage reductions and drought surcharges. Tariff Rule 14.1 focuses primarily on restrictions of outdoor water use which accounts for 50% of a typical customer's water usage. The drought surcharges are recorded in a drought account authorized by the CPUC. The amount collected will offset future surcharges that would be necessary to recover lost revenue due to drought conservation efforts. San Jose Water Company is continually working to remain in compliance with the various drought rules and regulations and is also working with local governments as well as the SCVWD to communicate consistent messages to the public about use restrictions and other matters related to the ongoing drought. 

California also faces long-term water supply challenges. San Jose Water Company actively works with SCVWD to meet the challenges by continuing to educate customers on responsible water use practices and conducting long-range water supply planning. 

CLWSC's water supply consists of groundwater from wells and purchased treated and raw water from the GBRA. CLWSC has long-term agreements with the GBRA, which expire in 2037, 2040, 2044 and 2050. The agreements, which are 

&#32;7 

take-or-pay contracts, provide CLWSC with an aggregate of 6,900 &#32;acre-feet of water per year from Canyon Lake at prices that may be adjusted periodically by GBRA. 

Please also see further discussion under Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Franchises 

Franchises granted by local jurisdictions permit Water Utility Services to construct, maintain, and operate a water distribution system within the streets and other public properties of a given jurisdiction. San Jose Water Company holds the necessary franchises to provide water in portions of the cities of San Jose and Cupertino and in the cities of Campbell, Monte Sereno and Saratoga, the Town of Los Gatos and the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County. None of the franchises have a termination date, other than the franchise for the unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County, which terminates in 2020. 

CLWSC holds the franchise for water and wastewater service to the City of Bulverde, which terminates in 2029. The unincorporated areas that CLWSC serves in Comal and Blanco Counties do not require water service providers to obtain franchises. 

Seasonal Factors 

Water sales are seasonal in nature and influenced by weather conditions. The timing of precipitation and climatic conditions can cause seasonal water consumption by customers to vary significantly. Demand for water is generally lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when the temperature rises and rain diminishes. 

Competition 

San Jose Water Company and CLWSC are public utilities regulated by the CPUC and PUCT, respectively, and operate within a service area approved by the regulators. The statutory laws provide that no other investor-owned public utility may operate in the public utilities' service areas without first obtaining from the regulator a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Past experience shows such a certificate will be issued only after demonstrating that service in such area is inadequate. 

California law also provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend utility service to the service area of a privately-owned public utility, like San Jose Water Company, such an act constitutes the taking of property and is conditioned upon payment of just compensation to the private utility. 

Under the California law, municipalities, water districts and other public agencies have been authorized to engage in the ownership and operation of water systems. Such agencies are empowered to condemn properties operated by privately-owned public utilities upon payment of just compensation and are further authorized to issue bonds (including revenue bonds) for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. To the Company's knowledge, no municipality, water district or other public agency has pending any proceeding to condemn any part of its water systems. 

Environmental Matters 

Water Utility Services' produces potable water in accordance with all applicable county, state and federal environmental rules and regulations. Additionally, public utilities are subject to environmental regulation by various other state and local governmental authorities. 

Water Utility Services is currently in compliance with all of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) surface water treatment performance standards, drinking water standards for disinfection by-products and primary maximum contaminant levels. These standards have been adopted and are enforced by the California State Water Board, Division of Drinking Water and the TCEQ for San Jose Water Company and CLWSC, respectively. 

Other state and local environmental regulations apply to our Water Utility Services' operations and facilities. These regulations relate primarily to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and discharges to the environment. In 2008, as part of routine replacement of infrastructure, San Jose Water Company identified legacy equipment containing elemental mercury which was released into the surrounding soil. San Jose Water Company has determined the release posed no risk of contamination to the water supply, notified the appropriate authorities and remediated the affected area. San Jose Water Company also identified 10 other potentially affected sites. Six of these sites have been remediated and San Jose Water Company is continuing its assessment of the remaining sites in conjunction with its infrastructure replacement program. SJW Corp. believes there will be no material financial impact related to this matter. In 2013, as part of routine maintenance and replacement of infrastructure, San Jose Water Company identified certain non-soluble contaminants that could become a hazard if released into the environment. As a precautionary measure, San Jose Water Company developed and implemented a plan to remove the source of the contaminants and expects to complete the plan in 2018. SJW Corp. believes there will be no material financial impact related to this matter. 

&#32;8 

San Jose Water Company is currently in compliance with all state and local regulations governing hazardous materials, point and non-point source discharges and the warning provisions of the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. Please also see Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;
