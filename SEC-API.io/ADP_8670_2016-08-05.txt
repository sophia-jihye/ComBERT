CORPORATE BACKGROUND 

General 

ADP &#174; &#32;was founded in 1949 on an innovative idea: to help business owners focus on core business activities by relieving them of certain administrative tasks such as payroll. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961. A pioneer in business process outsourcing, today we are one of the world&#8217;s leading providers of human capital management (&#8220;HCM&#8221;) solutions to employers, offering solutions to businesses of all sizes, whether they have simple or complex needs. We serve more than 650,000 clients in more than 110 countries and territories. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market&#174; under the symbol &#8220;ADP.&#8221; 

When we refer to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ADP,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

&#8226; 

Outside the United States, ADP offers comprehensive HCM solutions on local, country-specific platforms. These suites of services offer various combinations of payroll, HR management, time and attendance management, and talent management, depending on the country in which the solution is provided. 

Payroll Services . ADP provides flexible payroll services to employers of all sizes, including the preparation of employee paychecks, pay statements, supporting journals, summaries, and management reports. ADP provides employers with 

a wide range of payroll options, including entering their payroll data online with an internet-based solution or via a mobile device, and outsourcing their entire payroll process to ADP. ADP also enables its clients to connect their major enterprise resource planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) applications with ADP&#8217;s outsourced payroll services. Employers can choose a variety of payroll payment options ranging from professionally printed checks to ADP&#8217;s electronic wage payment and, in the United States, payroll card solutions. On behalf of our clients, ADP prepares and files federal, state and local payroll tax returns and quarterly and annual Social Security, Medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports in the United States, and prepares and files similar reports internationally . In addition, as part of our payroll services globally, ADP supplies year-end regulatory and legislative tax statements and other forms to our clients&#8217; employees. For those clients who choose to process payroll in-house, in the United States, ADP also delivers our Payment and Compliance Solutions described below.

Employee benefits administration options in the United States include health and welfare administration, spending account management (health care spending accounts, dependent care spending accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, health savings accounts, commuter benefits, and employee reimbursement services), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (&#8220;COBRA&#8221;) administration, direct bill services, leave administration services, insurance carrier enrollment services, employee communication services, and dependent verification services. In addition, ADP benefits administration solutions offer employers an efficient cloud-based eligibility and enrollment system that provides their employees with tools, communications, and other resources they need to understand their benefits options and make informed choices. 

Talent Management . ADP&#8217;s Talent Management solutions simplify the talent acquisition and performance management process from recruitment to ongoing employee development. ADP&#8217;s proprietary recruiting automation platform helps employers find, recruit, and hire talent quickly and cost effectively. Employers can also meet their hiring needs by outsourcing their internal recruitment function to ADP. ADP&#8217;s pre-employment services enable employers to track candidates, screen candidate backgrounds, and integrate data to facilitate the onboarding process for new hires. ADP&#8217;s performance and compensation management applications provide tools to automate the entire performance management process, from goal planning to employee evaluations and help employers align compensation with employee performance within budgetary constraints. When combined with ADP&#8217;s performance management applications, ADP&#8217;s career development and succession management solutions offer tools that allow employees to build and update their employee profiles, search for potential positions within the organization, and create forward-looking career paths, while enabling managers to identify and mitigate potential retention risks. In addition, ADP&#8217;s learning management solutions provide a single point of access to learning and knowledge management capabilities via multiple online delivery methods. 

Human Resources Management . Commonly referred to as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), ADP&#8217;s Human Resources Management Solutions provide employers with a single system of record to support the entry, validation, maintenance, and reporting of data required for effective HR management, such as employee names, addresses, job types, salary grades, employment history, and educational background. ADP&#8217;s Human Resources Management Solutions can also be combined with ADP&#8217;s Talent Management Solutions and other HCM offerings. 

Time and Attendance Management . ADP offers multiple options for employers of all sizes to collect employee time and attendance information, including electronic timesheets, badge cards, biometric and touch-screen time clocks, telephone/interactive voice response, and mobile smartphones and tablets.

Insurance Services . ADP&#8217;s Insurance Services business, in conjunction with our licensed insurance agency, Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc., facilitates access in the United States to workers&#8217; compensation and group health insurance for small and mid-sized clients through a variety of insurance carriers. ADP&#8217;s automated Pay-by-Pay &#174; &#32;premium payment program calculates and collects workers&#8217; compensation premium payments each pay period in order to simplify this task for employers.

ADP Retirement Services offers a full service 401(k) plan program, which provides recordkeeping and administrative services, combined with an investment platform offered through ADP Broker-Dealer, Inc. that gives our clients&#8217; employees access to a wide range of non-proprietary investment options and online tools to monitor the performance of their investments.

ADP&#8217;s specialized teams use the data and work with clients to help them manage changing regulatory landscapes and improve business processes. ADP SmartCompliance integrates several HCM-related compliance processes, including health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, employment tax, wage payments, tax credits, wage garnishments, unemployment claims, and employment verifications.

In connection with these services, ADP collects federal, state, and local employment taxes from clients and remits these taxes, as appropriate, to approximately 7,100 federal, state, and local tax agencies. ADP also responds to inquiries from tax agencies. In addition to our full service employment tax solution, ADP offers a software solution for do-it-yourself employment tax management that can complement a client&#8217;s in-house payroll system. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2016 &#8221;), ADP in the United States processed and delivered approximately 60 million employee year-end tax statements and approximately 53 million &#32; employer payroll tax returns and deposits, and moved approximately $1.7 trillion in client funds to taxing and other agencies and our clients&#8217; employees and other payees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, and check. 

ADP SmartCompliance Wage Payments . In the United States, in addition to ADPCheck, ADP&#8217;s traditional payroll check offering, ADP offers electronic payroll disbursement options that can be integrated with the client&#8217;s payroll systems and ERP applications. With ALINE Pay by ADP&#174;, payroll can be disbursed via ALINE Check by ADP&#174;, direct deposit, or the ALINE Card by ADP&#174;, a network-branded payroll card.

Using the ALINE Card by ADP, employees can access their payroll funds immediately in several ways, including via a network member bank, an ATM or a point of sale terminal. The ALINE Card by ADP can also be used to make purchases or pay bills. Additional features of the ALINE Card by ADP include the ability to load additional funds onto the card, receive electronic payments such as government benefits or tax refunds, and transfer funds from the card to a bank account in the United States.

MARKETS AND SALES 

Employer Services&#8217; HCM solutions are offered in more than 110 countries and territories. The most material markets for our HCM solutions are the United States, Canada and Europe and, for each market, we have both country-specific solutions and solutions based on our multi-country offerings, for employers of different sizes and complexities. The major components of our HCM offering throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and time and attendance management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Australia, India, and China. PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States. 

We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and certified public accountants, among others. None of ADP&#8217;s major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client or industry group is material to ADP&#8217;s overall revenues. ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk. 

COMPETITION 

The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services competes with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions. PEO Services competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions. Other competitive factors include a company&#8217;s in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems. 

Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on service and product quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of services and products, and price. We believe that ADP is competitive in each of these areas and that our commitment to service excellence, together with our leading-edge technology, distinguishes us from our competitors. 

INDUSTRY REGULATION 

Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs. 

As one of the world&#8217;s largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws. For instance, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our COBRA, flexible spending account and insurance services businesses, and ADP TotalSource. We are also subject to federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data. Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, including the invalidation in the European Union of the Safe Harbor Principles for the transfer of personal data between the European Union and the United States and the adoption by the European Union of a general data protection regulation, will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. 

As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients&#8217; employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck. Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements. In addition, our U.S. prepaid access offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;). Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar licensing and anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services. Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements. Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients&#8217; worksite employees, we may be subject to certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws. 

In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services. For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services in the United States are designed to help our clients comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers&#8217; benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits. 

The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for 

information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences. 

CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS 

ADP provides its services to more than 650,000 clients. In fiscal 2016, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of ADP&#8217;s annual consolidated revenues. 

ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business. This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients. In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years. However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of ADP&#8217;s expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not used by management internally to estimate ADP&#8217;s future revenue. 

Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP. ADP&#8217;s client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in Employer Services, and approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period. 

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its solutions and services. In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on ADP's revenues. ADP believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles. 

SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING 

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , ADP invested approximately $818 million, $767 million, and $686 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms, the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses. 

LICENSES 

ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADP&#8217;s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP&#8217;s business as a whole. 

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES 

ADP employed approximately 57,000 persons as of June 30, 2016 .
