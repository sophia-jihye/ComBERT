Overview 

&#160;

We are a developer, manufacturer and marketer of a proprietary line of nutritional supplements addressing basic nutrition, specific wellness needs, weight management and sports nutrition. We sell our products through an international network marketing system using independent distributors. We have sold products in the United States since 1988 and in selected international markets since 1991.

&#160;

We currently offer 17 nutritional supplements, and our product offering has selectively evolved over our history. Our core line of nutritional supplements which represented 63.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, included the following five products:

&#160;

&#8226; Reliv Classic and Reliv NOW &#8212; two basic nutritional supplements containing a full and balanced blend of vitamins, minerals, protein and herbs &#8226; Innergize! &#8212; an isotonic sports supplement in two flavors &#8226; FibRestore &#8212; a high-fiber and antioxidant supplement &#8226; LunaRich X &#8212; a soy concentrate with elevated levels of lunasin, in capsule form &#160;

Following the introduction of our LunaRich X capsules in 2013, we experienced a gradual shift in our product sales mix reflecting an increasing emphasis on Reliv NOW and LunaRich X capsules. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Reliv NOW constituted 23.2% of net sales, and LunaRich X capsules represented 17.5%. The combination of Reliv NOW and LunaRich X capsules have increasingly become the focus of our product strategy. As a result of this strategy, in March 2014 we launched our Super Pack product kit that contains four cans of Reliv NOW and two bottles of LunaRich X each containing 120 capsules. The Super Pack was designed as a simple, focused approach that capitalizes on our two most popular products and provides an entry point at a 25% discount for new distributors who want to build a business. Super Packs constituted 5.5% of net sales in 2015. A Super Pack containing Reliv Classic and LunaRich X is also available for our distributors and customers that prefer Reliv Classic.

&#160;

We periodically refine our products and introduce related new products and product categories. Our internal research and development team has developed most of our products, and we hold U.S. patents on five of these products &#8212;Arthaffect, ReversAge, GlucAffect, ProVantage and 24K. In addition, we have applied for a U.S. patent on our CardioSentials product. We also hold the exclusive license to patents and patent applications related to lunasin through a Technology License Agreement we entered into in July 2013.

&#160;

We believe that our network marketing model is the best method for the marketing and sale of our products because it utilizes ongoing personal contact among our distributors and their retail customers. This enables our distributors to communicate directly regarding the products, the business opportunity we offer and their personal experiences with both. We provide our distributors with a financially rewarding and entrepreneurial business opportunity, affording them the ability to earn compensation both from the direct sale of products and from sales volume generated by distributors they sponsor. We actively support our distributors by providing marketing materials, a dependable product fulfillment system and frequent educational, training and motivational programs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The majority of our sales traditionally has been, and is expected to continue to be, made through our distributors in the United States. We also currently generate sales through distributor networks in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In each country in which we conduct business, our distributors operate under a uniform business and compensation model that maintains consistent marketing, sales, fulfillment, and compliance procedures. As of December 31, 2015, our network consisted of approximately 44,590 distributors &#8212;32,270 in the United States and 12,320 across our international markets.

&#160;

We manufacture all of our powdered nutritional supplements and our LunaRich X capsules at our facility in Chesterfield, Missouri. We believe our ability to formulate and manufacture all but one of our own nutritional supplements enables us to produce our products efficiently while maintaining our high standards of quality assurance and proprietary product composition.

&#160;

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Nutritional Supplement Market 

&#160;

We operate primarily in the $34.8 billion U.S. nutritional supplement market, which is part of the broader $140 billion U.S. nutrition industry according to data published by the Nutrition Business Journal , or NBJ, and an estimated $320.0 billion global nutrition industry, also according to the NBJ. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans, or 68% of all U.S. adults, take dietary supplements annually according to the Council for Responsible Nutrition.

&#160;

A combination of demographic, healthcare and lifestyle trends are expected to drive continued growth in the nutritional supplement market. These trends include:

&#160; 

&#183; Aging Population: The older population (persons 65 years or older) numbered 44.7 million in 2013 according to latest information from the Department of Health and Human Services. They represented 14.1% of the U.S. population, about one in every seven Americans. By 2060, there will be approximately 98 million older persons living in the United States, more than twice their number in 2013. Recent data from the Council for Responsible Nutrition shows that 74% of adults aged 55 and over take dietary supplements. We believe this ever-growing population, living longer lives than in previous decades, will continue to focus on their nutritional needs as they age. &#160;

&#183; Rising Healthcare Costs and Commitment to Health: The cost of healthcare in the United States continues to increase rapidly each year and grew at an annual rate of 5% in 2014 according to the Alatrum Institute. In 2014, U.S. healthcare spending reached $3.0 trillion or $9,523 per person according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). As reported from Frost and Sullivan, approximately 75% of total U.S. health care expenditures are spent on preventable health issues. Many studies have demonstrated that dietary supplements have a positive effect on reducing the potential for health issues and consumers are reacting to this by taking charge of their personal health. In a recent survey conducted by Harris Poll, taking vitamins was in the top five commitments to health and wellness habits. We believe more consumers will seek the use of nutritional supplements to maintain quality of life as well as reduce medical costs. &#160;

&#183; Continued Focus on Weight Management: According to a report published by The State of Obesity in August 2015, almost 35%, or more than one-third of U.S. men and women were obese, as were almost 17% of U.S. children. It is estimated that 86.3% of Americans will be overweight or obese by 2030. Health care costs related to obesity are expected to grow, from $860.7 billion to $956.9 billion by 2030 and currently account for almost 21% of U.S. health care costs according to a report by Cornell University. Being overweight is linked to more than 60 chronic diseases and can lead to more serious health concerns such as diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, weight loss supplement sales totaled $2 billion in 2013 which is up 11.6% from 2012. Bearing these facts in mind, we believe that there will be a continual need not only for weight loss products but also for wellness products. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Direct Selling Market 

&#160;

Health and nutrition products are distributed through various market means, including retailers such as supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants and specialty retailers; direct marketers such as mail order companies and Internet retailers; and direct sellers such as network marketers and healthcare practitioners. We distribute our products through the direct selling channel via our network marketers.

&#160;

Direct selling involves the marketing of products and services directly to consumers in a person-to-person manner. Direct selling is a significant global industry largely utilized for the sale of a wide range of consumer products from companies such as Avon Products Inc., Alticor Inc. (Amway Corp.) and Tupperware Brands Corporation. According to the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations, or WFDSA, the 2014 global direct selling market (for all product categories) was estimated to be $182.8 billion, an increase from $178.5 billion in 2013. The WFDSA estimates that the number of individuals engaged in direct selling more than doubled between 1999 and 2014, from 35.9 million sellers to 99.7 million in 2014. The United States had 18.2 million direct sellers in 2014, the most of any country. Globally, wellness products came in as the 2 nd top selling category, just a mere 5% behind cosmetics and personal care.

&#160;

While the United States is currently the largest direct selling market with $34.4 billion in annual sales in 2014, international markets account for 81% of the entire industry, according to the WFDSA. Twenty-three countries (including the United States) have annual direct sales revenue of at least $1 billion and another twenty-seven countries have annual direct sales revenue of at least $100 million, according to the WFDSA.

&#160;

We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the world-wide growth trends in direct sales, as both a developer and manufacturer of proprietary nutritional products, utilizing our network marketing distribution system.

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we possess a number of competitive strengths that are key to our growth and profitability in the future.

&#160;

Leading Marketer of Bioavailable Lunasin-Containing Products . As a result of our Technology License Agreement with Soy Labs LLC, we control certain technology and proprietary testing and manufacturing processes that allow us to produce LunaRich X, to our knowledge, the only commercial source of soy concentrate with elevated levels of bioactive lunasin. One 310 mg capsule of LunaRich X contains an amount of lunasin equivalent to 25 grams of high quality soy protein. In addition to our LunaRich X capsules, we fortified six other nutritional supplements with LunaRich X so that a serving of those products yields an amount of lunasin equivalent to consuming 25 grams of soy protein. The products fortified with LunaRich X are Reliv NOW, Reliv NOW for Kids, ProVantage, GlucAffect, SoySentials, and Slimplicity.

&#160;

Complete, Simple Nutrition. We focus on the completeness, balance and simplicity of our basic nutritional supplements &#8212; Reliv Classic or Reliv NOW &#8212; combined with LunaRich X. Our recommended daily regimen for any new distributor or customer is one shake of either Reliv NOW or Reliv Classic and two capsules of LunaRich X. Our two basic nutritional supplements each contain a full and balanced blend of vitamins, minerals, proteins and herbs supporting an individual&#8217;s daily nutritional needs and our LunaRich X capsules support an individual&#8217;s wellness at the epigenetic level. The combination of Reliv NOW or Reliv Classic and LunaRich X makes supplementation simple and effective for the consumer. Consistent with this focus, in 2014 we launched Reliv Super Packs containing a four-month supply of Reliv NOW or Reliv Classic and LunaRich X based on the one shake and two capsules per day regimen. For more specific individual needs, we provide 14 additional supplements. We believe that our two basic nutritional supplements, together with LunaRich X and our additional supplements and other products, enhance the ability of our distributors to build their businesses by providing a comprehensive, simple product offering.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Nutritional Supplements Consumed in Liquid Form. We believe that our nutritional supplements which are consumed in liquid form, except for our LunaRich X capsules, provide a competitive advantage over other supplements such as vitamins, minerals and herbs in pill or tablet form. Our powder-based nutritional products are consumed with water, milk or juice and 24K is a ready-to-drink product. Our products provide an effective means of delivering nutrients to the body. We believe nutrients taken orally in liquid form lead to better absorption at the cellular level, or &#8220;bioavailability.&#8221; Where serving sizes mandate, as with our LunaRich X capsules, we will use easily digestible capsules as a convenient and effective way of delivering small serving sizes of our powdered nutritional supplements.

&#160;

In-House Development and Production. We have developed substantially all of our nutritional supplement and food products utilizing nutrition science as the basis for product formulation. We maintain an ongoing research and development effort led by Carl W. Hastings, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer and Vice Chairman. In addition, we consult regularly with other industry professionals with respect to developments in nutritional science, product enhancements and new products. Since 1993, we have manufactured substantially all of our nutritional products at our facility in Chesterfield, Missouri. In 2015, we installed an encapsulator and bottling line to produce our LunaRich X capsules. We outsource our ready-to-drink product, 24K. We believe our ability to formulate and manufacture all but one of our own nutritional supplement products enables us to maintain our high standards of quality assurance and proprietary product composition.

&#160;

Experienced Ambassador Team. Our Ambassador corps consists of distributors who have achieved the level of Master Director, have earned royalty payments of at least $4,000 in consecutive months and meet our leadership and character criteria necessary to garner our invitation to be an Ambassador. Our Ambassadors generally are our most productive distributors and are essential in recruiting, motivating and training our entire distributor network. We, and our Ambassadors, lead hundreds of annual events throughout all of our markets to motivate and train distributors, including regular recruiting meetings, trainings, conference calls, training schools for Master Affiliates and higher levels and regional, national and international distributor conferences. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 376 Ambassadors worldwide.

&#160;

Experienced and Incentivized Management Team. Our management team is led by our founder, Robert L. Montgomery, who has been our Chief Executive Officer since the inception of our company in 1985. Our executive officers have been employed by our company for an average of 20 years and are experienced in their areas of focus, which include manufacturing, sales, finance, marketing and operations. As of March 7, 2016, our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately 37.6% of our common stock.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our basic objective is to increase our net sales by increasing the number and productivity of our distributors and by periodically improving our existing products and introducing new products. We also intend to invest in our infrastructure to improve our operating efficiencies, provide better service to our distributors and leverage our current operating facilities to improve our profitability. We seek to accomplish these objectives by employing the following strategic initiatives:

&#160;

Leverage and Expand our Existing Distributor Base Throughout the United States. The United States has been and will continue to be our largest market. Our growth strategy in the United States involves multiple initiatives, such as continued investment in company-sponsored events and distributor training and better utilization of our upper-level distributors across different geographical areas to increase our distributor base.

&#160;

Increase Appeal to Broader Demographic. Traditionally, our customer and distributor demographic has skewed towards baby boomers and older individuals searching for nutritional solutions to supplement their diet and support overall wellness. While continuing to maintain our focus on the needs of this important segment, we believe there is an opportunity to expand our sales and distributor base by increasing our appeal to younger generations interested in nutrition and an active healthy lifestyle. We believe the nutritional aspects and convenience of 24K, our healthy energy and mental focus drink, will attract health conscious on-the-go individuals, many of whom fall within the under-40 demographic. Further, we maintain an active presence on popular social media sites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and several other social networks that are popular with younger generations. Our internal social media team is comprised of Gen X and Gen Y staffers who regularly interact with distributors, customers and prospects. We plan to continue to develop products and programs and expand our technology offerings in an effort to further appeal to younger generations interested in healthy active lifestyles and a vibrant evolving business opportunity.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Expand in Existing and New International Markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our net sales in international markets. We have a business model that is compatible across all of our markets and encourages our distributors to pursue their business in multiple markets. We believe this business model supports expansion of our distributor network in our existing international markets and will provide a framework that facilitates our entry into new international markets. To that end, we continue to monitor business conditions in potential new markets and will selectively expand as timing and conditions are appropriate.

&#160;

Invest in Improved and New Products. As a developer of nutritional supplements, it is vital to continue to invest in the research and development of new and innovative products. For example, in January 2013 we launched LunaRich X to support heart health and overall wellness and in February 2011 we launched 24K, our first ready-to-drink product, to support energy production and mental focus. Additionally, we will continue to improve and validate the efficacy of our existing product line. These types of investments should facilitate customer and distributor retention, as well as the recruitment of new distributors.

&#160;

Expand and Improve our Manufacturing and Distribution Capabilities. We currently manufacture all of our powdered nutritional supplements and LunaRich X capsules at our facility in Chesterfield, Missouri. This allows us to precisely control product composition and quality assurance as well as better manage inventory levels. Periodically, we make appropriate investments that enhance our manufacturing capabilities and capacity to further leverage our existing facilities and trained production staff. In the second half of 2014, we purchased and installed an encapsulation production line in our facility in Chesterfield, Missouri. We expect to continue to make appropriate investments in our manufacturing and fulfillment facilities.

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160;

Product Overview 

&#160;

Our product line includes nutritional supplements that address basic nutrition, specific wellness needs, weight management and sports nutrition. We combine ingredients from science and nature in targeted, well-balanced, easy-to-use formulas that are specifically designed to enhance wellness and increase performance and energy in specific applications. All but two of our supplements are in powdered form that the consumer mixes with water, juice or other liquid. 24K is a ready-to-drink nutritional supplement, and LunaRich X is available in capsule form.

&#160;

We currently offer 17 nutritional supplements. Our basic nutritional supplements are formulated to provide a balanced and complete level of supplementation for the consumer. For more specific needs, we provide other focused product formulations. We have purposely been selective in the number and types of products that we offer. By providing a line of targeted products, we make it simple for our distributors and consumers to choose products appropriate for their objectives. We consider four of our oldest and best selling products &#8212; Reliv Classic, Reliv NOW, Innergize!, and FibRestore &#8212; along with LunaRich X capsules, our newest product, to be our primary or &#8220;core&#8221; products.

In October 2013, Reliv ReShape was launched in our Australian and New Zealand markets, at which time Slimsimply was discontinued in those markets.

Research and Development 

&#160;

We maintain an ongoing research and development effort, led by Carl W. Hastings, Ph.D., and consult with other industry professionals with respect to developments in nutritional science, product enhancements and new products. Since 2005, we have introduced four nutritional supplement products, including CardioSentials, Slimplicity meal replacement, 24K, and LunaRich X. From time to time, we have also reformulated and enhanced our products, including the addition of LunaRich soy powder to Reliv NOW, Reliv NOW for Kids, ProVantage, SoySentials, GlucAffect and Slimplicity in 2012. Our research and development team consistently evaluates product advancements in the marketplace and advancements in raw materials and ingredients available for new product ideas and developments.

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our research and development expenses were $765,000 and $618,000, respectively.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

SL Technology, Inc. 

&#160;

In mid-2013, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, SL Technology, Inc. (&#8220;SLTI&#8221;) for the purpose of entering into a Technology License Agreement (the &#8220;License Agreement&#8221;) with Soy Labs, LLC (&#8220;Soy Labs&#8221;). Pursuant to this License Agreement, Soy Labs granted SLTI an exclusive license for its intellectual property related to its soy concentrate with elevated levels of bioactive lunasin and other soy-related ingredients. The license covers an issued patent and several patent applications related to lunasin and soy-related peptides, proprietary information and manufacturing processes of Soy Labs. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the terms of the License Agreement.

&#160;

SLTI has agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to market the products covered by the License Agreement. In addition, SLTI hired Soy Labs staff and we agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase all of our requirements of soy concentrate from SLTI.

Network Marketing Program 

&#160;

General Overview 

&#160;

We market and sell our products through a network marketing system of independent distributors, who purchase our products from us, or from other distributors, and who then sell our products directly to consumers. In addition to selling our products, our distributors also recruit others to distribute our products. Distributors receive compensation from both the sale of the products they have purchased at wholesale and, in the case of Master Affiliates and above, commissions on the volume of products sold by their downline organization. We believe network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows and relies on personal contact, education and endorsement of products which are not as readily available through other distribution channels.

&#160;

We recognize that our sales growth is based on the continued development and growth of our independent distributor force and we strive to maintain an active and motivated distributor network through a combination of quality products, and a business opportunity with distributor discounts, commissions and bonus payments, sales conventions, training, personal recognition and a variety of publications and promotional materials.

&#160;

Program Structure 

&#160;

Individuals who desire to market and sell our products may become distributors by being sponsored into the program by an existing distributor, and becoming part of that distributor&#8217;s &#8220;downline.&#8221; We offer a tiered discount and commission, or royalty, format that consists of four principal levels and several sub-levels, which are designed to compensate and motivate distributors to increase their networks and sales volumes.

&#160;

Our distributors consist principally of individuals, although we also permit entities such as corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and trusts to become distributors. A new distributor is required to complete a distributor application and, in most areas, to purchase a package of distributor materials (for $40 plus sales tax in the United States, as of February 1, 2016) consisting of a Distributor Guide and CD, business forms and promotional materials. The Distributor Agreement, when accepted by us, becomes the contract between us and the distributor and obligates the distributor to the terms of the agreement, which includes our Policies and Procedures for conduct of their business. All distributors are independent contractors and are not our employees.

&#160;

In each country in which we conduct business, distributors operate under a compensation system pursuant to which distributors generally are compensated based on their sales volumes. On the basis of sales volume or commission volume, distributors may achieve the following successive levels of achievement and compensation:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Designation &#160; Discount &#160; Retail Distributor (1) &#160; &#160; 20 % Affiliate &#160; &#160; 25 % Key Affiliate &#160; &#160; 30 % Senior Affiliate &#160; &#160; 35 % Master Affiliate &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) Director &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) Key Director &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) Senior Director &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) Master Director/Ambassador &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) Presidential Director/Ambassador &#160; &#160; 40 % (2) &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(1) Effective February 1, 2016, we made adjustments to our distributor compensation plan. Among the changes made, we reduced the purchasing discount of a Retail Distributor to 10%; however, the distributor is able to reach the Affiliate level through cumulative purchases totaling $750 at suggested retail. (2) In addition to discounts, these levels also receive commissions based on sales in their downline organization. &#160;

Distributors purchase products from us at a discount from the suggested retail price for the products and then may sell the product at retail to customers, sell the product to other distributors at wholesale or consume the product. The amount of the discount varies depending on the distributor&#8217;s level of achievement, as indicated above.

&#160;

Distributors generate income equal to the difference between the price at which they sell the product to customers and the discounted price they pay for the product. Distributors also earn wholesale commissions on products purchased by downline distributors in the distributor&#8217;s sponsored group equal to the difference between the price at which the distributor is entitled to purchase product and the price at which downline distributors purchase product. We calculate payments and issue a check directly to the qualified distributor once a month. For example, assume Distributor A is a 40% discount Master Affiliate who signs up Distributor B, a 30% discount Key Affiliate, who signs up Distributor C, a 10% discount Retail Distributor. If Distributor C purchases directly from us, a 10% wholesale profit check will be sent to Distributor A and a 20% wholesale profit check will be sent to Distributor B.

&#160;

Upon achieving the level of Master Affiliate, distributors begin to receive additional compensation &#8212; &#8220;generation royalty&#8221; &#8212; payments of 8%, 6%, 4%, 3% and 2% of the retail volume of product purchased from us by Master Affiliates and above (and their personal groups) whom they have sponsored, and for each of five downline levels of sponsorship. To qualify for these additional compensation payments, Master Affiliates and above are required to maintain certain monthly sales volumes.

&#160;

Master Affiliates who sponsor other distributors that achieve the level of Master Affiliate are entitled to become part of the Director Program. Advancement at the Director level is based upon achieving increasing levels of royalties based on sales generated by other distributors in the Director&#8217;s downline organization. Distributors achieving each level receive recognition for their achievements at our company-sponsored events and in our publications. We also have a Star Director Program under which distributors achieving the level of Director and above receive additional compensation based on the number of Master Affiliates they have sponsored into the program. Directors receive an additional 1% to 3% royalty on the retail sales volume of Master Affiliates in their downline organization for an unlimited number of levels of sponsorship, until reaching a level that includes a Master Affiliate who also has achieved Star Director status.

&#160;

Master Directors and Presidential Directors may also be invited to participate in the Ambassador Program. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 376 Ambassadors worldwide. Qualifications to be invited by us to participate in the Ambassador Program include demonstrated competence and leadership qualities. Ambassadors receive recognition and awards for achieving Ambassador status and can then achieve additional levels of accomplishment. We utilize our Ambassadors to lead meetings and conferences, and to provide training and education to our distributors. Ambassadors achieving the level of Silver and higher also participate in the &#8220;Reliv Inner Circle,&#8221; which may entitle them to receive additional compensation, paid participation in our sponsored events, health insurance and car allowances.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the levels of compensation described, we also provide a variety of incentives, bonuses, awards and trips to distributors who achieve high sales volumes and who advance in the distributor ranks.

&#160;

Distributor Training, Motivation and Management 

&#160;

Our marketing efforts are focused on the development, training, motivation and support of our independent distributors. We support an active training program for our distributors in which our representatives and experienced distributors, usually Ambassadors, lead group training sessions. We provide distributors with manuals, brochures and other promotional, training and informational publications. We encourage distributors to hold regular weekly recruiting meetings and training sessions. We sponsor weekly training conference calls in which a significant number of distributors participate.

&#160;

Our sponsorship generally includes the following:

&#160;

&#8226; During 2015, we sponsored numerous special events in cities across all of our markets led by corporate executives and/or experienced Ambassadors; &#160;

&#8226; For each market in which we operate, we sponsor an annual conference for distributors; and &#160;

&#8226; In the United States during 2015, we sponsored an annual International Conference in the summer for all worldwide distributors and winter conferences on each coast for U.S. distributors. &#160;

During 2015, we invested approximately $1.96 million in training, conferences and promotional events for our distributors worldwide compared with $1.97 million in 2014.

&#160;

Distributor Compliance 

&#160;

Our distributor organization and business model are designed and intended to promote the sale of our products to consumers by distributors. Sales training and promotional efforts emphasize that intention. To that end, we monitor purchases by distributors to identify potentially excessive individual purchases and keep detailed information regarding customer purchases through our corporate shopping cart and as part of our autoship program. Distributors are not required at any time to purchase product, although Master Affiliates and above are required to maintain certain minimum sales levels in their personal groups to continue receiving generation royalty compensation payments.

&#160;

Distributors may create their own advertising provided that it is within our advertising rules. Unless a distributor is using our designed and approved advertisements, the distributor must submit for approval in writing all advertising (e.g. brochures, flyers, audio tapes, classified or display ads, radio scripts) to our Compliance Department before placing it or arranging for placement.

&#160;

Pursuant to our Policies and Procedures, which are incorporated by reference into our Distributor Agreement, distributors are permitted to make only those claims about our products that have been approved by us and/or provided in sales and training materials. Distributors acknowledge that our products are not represented as drugs and they are not authorized to make any diagnosis of any medical condition, make drug-type claims for, or prescribe our products to treat or cure, any disease or condition. We do not authorize or permit our distributors to make any express or implied references with regard to our products that they cure, prevent or relieve disease, replace or augment medication, provide therapy, promote healing, alleviate illnesses or symptoms of illnesses, or make any other medical claims for specific ailments.

&#160;

In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our distributors, we conduct considerable research into the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify all necessary licenses and approvals and applicable limitations on operations in that market. We devote substantial resources to obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals and maintaining operations that are in compliance with the applicable limitations. We also research laws applicable to distributor operations and revise or alter distributor materials and products, as required by applicable regulations in each market.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. In addition, regulations affecting our business often change and are subject to varying interpretation and application. We make every effort to monitor and comply with changes in laws and regulations as they occur.

&#160;

We have a Compliance Department that receives and reviews allegations of distributor misconduct. If we determine that a distributor has violated our Policies and Procedures, we may take a number of disciplinary actions. For example, we may impose sanctions such as warnings or suspensions until specific conditions are satisfied, or take other appropriate actions at our discretion, including termination of the distributor&#8217;s agreement.

&#160;

Geographic Presence 

&#160;

Markets 

&#160;

We currently sell our products throughout the United States and in 14 other countries around the world. We have sold products in the United States since 1988 and our first product outside of the United States in 1991 when we entered Australia. In 2015, approximately 22.0% of our net sales were generated outside of the United States.

&#160;

The table below shows the countries in which we operate and the year we commenced selling products:

&#160;

Country &#160; Year Entered &#160; Country &#160; Year Entered United States &#160; 1988 &#160; Ireland &#160; 2003 Australia &#160; 1991 &#160; Singapore &#160; 2004 New Zealand &#160; 1992 &#160; Germany &#160; 2005 Canada &#160; 1992 &#160; Austria &#160; 2006 Mexico &#160; 1993 &#160; Netherlands &#160; 2006 United Kingdom (1) &#160; 1995 &#160; Indonesia &#160; 2009 Philippines &#160; 2000 &#160; France &#160; 2013 Malaysia &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(1) Includes Great Britain, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. &#160;

Within the United States, we sell our products to distributors in all 50 states. We derived 41.5% of our domestic net sales in 2015 in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Texas, Ohio, and Florida, with each state contributing at least 4% of net sales. We believe that there is the opportunity to increase the number of our distributors in all markets where we sell our products.

&#160;

We organize all of our international operations under our wholly owned subsidiary, Reliv&#8217; World. As of December 31, 2015, Reliv&#8217; World consisted of the following market-specific entities: Reliv&#8217; Australia, Reliv&#8217; New Zealand, Reliv&#8217; Canada, Reliv&#8217; Mexico, Reliv&#8217; Europe, Reliv&#8217; Philippines, Reliv&#8217; Malaysia, Reliv&#8217; Singapore, and PT Reliv&#8217; Indonesia. We have utilized this method of separate corporations in most of our markets, as local business licensing and product approvals require a local legal entity.

&#160;

We believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase sales in our current international markets, as a whole. We have established a consistent business model and compensation plan across all of our markets, and we continue to support our international markets with additional marketing programs and materials.

&#160;

In addition to increasing sales in current international markets, our expansion strategy targets selected new foreign markets. Our presence in the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, as well as market performance, regional interest and distributor activity, have led to an increased focus on expansion in the European Union. We opened for business in France in 2013 and are evaluating other expansion opportunities within the European Union.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

New Market Entry Process 

&#160;

When conditions warrant, we evaluate new markets for our products. In order to do so, we perform an analysis of synergies between new and existing countries and distributor presence or interest in new markets, market conditions, regulatory conditions, product approval procedures and competition before selecting markets to enter. Once we decide to enter a new market, we first hire local legal counsel and/or a consultant with appropriate expertise to:

&#160;

&#8226; help ensure that our network marketing system and products comply with all applicable regulations; &#160;

&#8226; help establish favorable public relations in the new market by acting as an intermediary between us and local regulatory authorities, public officials and business people; and &#160;

&#8226; explain our products and product ingredients to appropriate regulators and, when necessary, to arrange for local technicians to conduct required ingredient analysis tests of the products. &#160;

Where regulatory approval in a foreign market is required, we utilize local counsel and/or consultants to work with regulatory agencies to confirm that all of the ingredients in our products are permissible within the new market. Where reformulation of one or more of our products is required, we attempt to obtain substitute or replacement ingredients. During the regulatory compliance process, we may alter the formulation, packaging, branding or labeling of our products to conform to applicable regulations as well as local variations in customs and consumer habits, and we may modify some aspects of our network marketing system as necessary to comply with applicable regulations.

&#160;

Following completion of the regulatory compliance phase, we undertake the steps necessary to meet the operations requirements of the new market. In the majority of our new markets, we establish a sales center in a major city and provide for product purchases by telephone and/or pick up. Product is shipped to the purchaser from a warehouse located in the general geographic market or the distributor may walk in to the local office and purchase products, if a pick up center is available. In addition, we initiate plans to satisfy inventory, personnel and transportation requirements of the new market, and we modify our distributor materials, recordings, videos and other training materials as necessary to be suitable for the new market.

&#160;

In some countries, regulations applicable to the activities of our distributors also may affect our business because in some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our distributors&#8217; conduct. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our distributors comply with local regulations.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We established a manufacturing line at our headquarters facility in Chesterfield, Missouri and began to manufacture all of our nutritional supplements in early 1993. We expanded our Chesterfield facility in 1997 to now include 126,000 square feet of total space. At this facility, we manufacture all of our powdered nutritional supplements and LunaRich X capsules for distribution both domestically and internationally. Only our 24K product is manufactured by a third party.

&#160;

Our ability to manufacture most of our nutritional supplements is a competitive advantage over competitors not engaged in manufacturing and contributes to our ability to provide high-quality products. Our product manufacturing includes identifying suppliers of raw materials, acquiring the finest quality raw materials, blending exact amounts of raw materials into batches, and canning and labeling the finished products. Since we carefully select our ingredient suppliers, we are able to control the quality of raw materials and our finished products. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining supplies of raw materials for our nutritional supplements or finished product of our 24K. By monitoring and testing products at all stages of the manufacturing process, we precisely control product composition. In addition, we believe we can more efficiently control costs by manufacturing all but one of our own nutritional supplements.

&#160;

In 1996, we received approval from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, to manufacture products sold in Australia at our Chesterfield plant. The certification of our Chesterfield site by the Australian TGA also satisfied Canadian requirements. In 2013, our Chesterfield plant was audited by the Australian TGA. Our current certification is valid until April 2017.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Fulfillment 

&#160;

Distributors order product in case lots of individual quantities and pay for the goods prior to shipment. We offer a program for distributors and their retail customers to order product in less than case lots directly from us by phone or internet order. Direct Advantage, an automatic monthly reorder program available for distributors and customers, provides a simple and convenient ordering process for consumers as well as distributors wanting to satisfy maintenance requirements. Product is shipped directly to the distributor or customer and upline distributors earn wholesale profits or, if applicable, a commission on all Direct Advantage sales.

&#160;

In the United States, our products are warehoused at our Chesterfield facility and shipped by common carrier to distributors upon order. Our facility in Chesterfield, Missouri serves all parts of the country. Our products are also warehoused in, and shipped to local distributors from: Sydney, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; Oakville, Canada; Guadalajara, Mexico; Redditch (Birmingham), England; Makati (Manila), Philippines; Subang Jaya (Kuala Lumpur), Malaysia; Singapore; and Jakarta, Indonesia. With the exception of our Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore subsidiaries, each of our subsidiaries maintains an office and personnel to receive, record, and fill orders from distributors. Distributors in Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands order and receive product from our UK-based subsidiary.

&#160;

We maintain a policy that unused product may be returned by a customer to the selling distributor for a full refund or exchange within 30 days after purchase. We also maintain a policy that any distributor who terminates his or her distributorship may return saleable product which was purchased from us within twelve months of the termination for a refund of 90% of the purchase price less any compensation received relating to the purchase of the products. We believe this buyback policy addresses and satisfies a number of regulatory compliance issues pertaining to network marketing systems.

&#160;

Historically, product returns and buy backs have not been significant. Product returns and buy backs have been approximately 0.24% and 0.25% of net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Information Technology Systems 

&#160;

In order to facilitate growth in the future and support our distributor activities, we continually upgrade our management information and telecommunication systems, along with increasing our internet-based capabilities. These systems include: (1) a centralized host computer in our Chesterfield headquarters, which is linked to our international offices via secure data connections that provide real-time order entry and information to respond to distributor inquiries, as well as financial and inventory management systems; (2) local area networks of personal computers within our markets, serving our local administrative staffs; (3) an international e-mail system through which our employees communicate; and (4) internet capabilities that provide a variety of online services to distributors, including product ordering, product information, event information and other related announcements, and tools to assist distributor leaders in managing their downline distributor group. We continue to pursue initiatives to increase the percentage of distributor orders placed via the internet. To accomplish this goal, we continue to make improvements to our shopping cart platform, and we have run periodic incentives to encourage distributors to place their orders via the internet. As a result of these initiatives, approximately 55% of our order volume in the United States is placed via internet.

&#160;

These systems are designed to provide financial and operating data for management, timely and accurate product ordering, generation royalty payment calculation and processing, inventory management, and detailed distributor records. We intend to continue to invest in our systems in order to help meet our business strategies.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our formulas are protected as trade secrets and, to the extent necessary, by confidentiality agreements. In addition, we have obtained U.S. patents on five products as set forth below:

&#160;

Product &#160; Patent Expiration Date &#160; &#160; &#160; Arthaffect &#160; March 2018 ReversAge &#160; May 2021 ProVantage &#160; April 2025 GlucAffect &#160; November 2029 24K &#160; February 2032 &#160;

Currently, we have 22 trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, including Reliv and the names of 14 of our 17 nutritional products. Reliv NOW for Kids, LunaRich X and ReShape are not registered with the USPTO. Trademark registrations for selected marks have been issued or applied for in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Germany and several other foreign countries that offer network marketing opportunities. We consider our trademarks to be an important asset of our business.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Product Regulation 

&#160;

The formulation, manufacturing, labeling and advertising or promotion of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which regulates our products under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various agencies of the states or countries into which our products are shipped or sold. FDA regulations include requirements and limitations with respect to the labeling of our food products and also with respect to the formulation of those products. FDA regulations also limit and control the extent to which health or other claims can be made with respect to the efficacy of any food or cosmetic. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most recently by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, or NLEA, and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, and related regulations. Such legislation governs the formulation, manufacturing, marketing and sale of nutritional supplements, including the content and presentation of health-related information included on the labels or labeling of nutritional supplements.

&#160;

The majority of the products we market are classified as dietary supplements under the FDCA. Dietary supplements such as those we manufacture and sell, for which no &#8220;drug&#8221; claim is made, are not subject to FDA approval prior to their sale. However, DSHEA established a pre-market notification process for dietary supplements that contain a &#8220;new dietary ingredient,&#8221; or NDI, a term that is defined as &#8220;a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994,&#8221; the date on which DSHEA was signed into law. Certain NDIs that have been &#8220;present in the food supply&#8221; are exempt from the notification requirement. For those NDIs that are not exempt, DSHEA requires the manufacturer or distributor of a dietary supplement containing an NDI to submit to the FDA, at least 75 days prior to marketing, a notification containing the basis for concluding that the dietary supplement containing the NDI will &#8220;reasonably be expected to be safe.&#8221; Dietary supplement products can be removed from the market if shown to be unsafe, or if the FDA determines, based on the labeling of products, that the intended use of the product is for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease. The FDA can regulate those products as &#8220;drugs&#8221; and require premarket approval of a &#8220;new drug application.&#8221; Manufacturers of dietary supplements that make any claims for dietary supplements, including product performance and health benefit claims, must have substantiation that the statements are truthful and not misleading.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In January 2000, the FDA published a final rule that defines the types of statements that can be made concerning the effect of a dietary supplement on the structure or function of the body pursuant to DSHEA. Under DSHEA, dietary supplement labeling may bear &#8220;structure/function&#8221; claims, which are claims that the products affect the structure or function of the body, without prior FDA approval. They may not, without prior FDA approval, bear a claim that they can prevent, treat, cure, mitigate or diagnose disease, otherwise known as a &#8220;drug claim.&#8221; The final rule describes how the FDA will distinguish drug claims from structure/function claims. Dietary supplements, like conventional foods, are also permitted to make &#8220;health claims,&#8221; which are claims that are exempt from regulation as &#8220;drug&#8221; claims pursuant to the amendments to the FDCA established by the NLEA in 1990. A &#8220;health claim&#8221; is a claim, ordinarily approved by FDA regulation, on a food or dietary supplement product&#8217;s labeling that &#8220;characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.&#8221; To help assure that foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics comply with the provisions of the FDCA and FDA&#8217;s regulations, the FDA has numerous enforcement tools, including the ability to issue warning letters, initiate product seizures and injunctions and pursue criminal penalties.

&#160;

The manufacture of dietary supplements is subject to existing FDA current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations for food. In June 2007, the FDA issued regulations relating to more detailed cGMP specifically for dietary supplements. Under these regulations, we qualify as a small business and became subject to the regulations in June 2009. We are periodically audited by the FDA and believe our systems and facilities in Chesterfield are in full compliance with cGMP.

&#160;

Advertisements for our products are subject to regulation by the FTC. The FTC prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce and provides that the dissemination of any false advertisement pertaining to drugs, cosmetics or foods, including dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive practice. Under the FTC&#8217;s substantiation doctrine, an advertiser must have a &#8220;reasonable basis&#8221; for all claims made about a product. The failure to be able to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. In order to avoid a violation of the FTC standards, we endeavor to assure that we have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made for our products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of distributor testimonials. Although it is impossible for us to monitor all the product claims made by our independent distributors, we make efforts to monitor distributor testimonials and restrict inappropriate distributor claims. The FTC has been more aggressive in pursuing enforcement against dietary supplement products since the passage of DSHEA in 1994, and has brought numerous actions against dietary supplement companies, some resulting in several million dollar civil penalties and/or restitution as well as court-ordered injunctions.

&#160;

We are aware that there is adverse publicity in many markets, including the United States, concerning foods that are grown from genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. In some markets, the possibility of health risks thought to be associated with GMOs has prompted proposed or actual governmental regulation. Nearly all ingredients in our formulas are non-GMO. We use non-GMO ingredients when required by governmental regulations and strive to use non-GMO ingredients in every other instance when commercially feasible and available. We believe compliance with regulatory requirements in this area should not have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Sales Program Regulation 

&#160;

Our distribution and sales program is subject to regulation by the FTC and other federal and state regulation as well as regulations in several countries in which we conduct business. Various state agencies regulate multi-level distribution services. We are required to register with, and submit information to, certain of such agencies and we believe we have complied fully with such requirements. We actively strive to comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations affecting our products and our sales and distribution programs. The Attorneys General of several states have taken an active role in investigating and prosecuting companies whose compensation plans they claim violate local anti-pyramid and/or consumer protection statutes. We are unable to predict the effect such increased activity will have on our business in the future nor are we able to predict the probability of future laws, regulations or interpretations which may be passed by state or federal regulatory authorities.

&#160;

Federal and state laws directed at network marketing programs have been adopted throughout the years to prevent the use of fraudulent practices often characterized as &#8220;pyramid schemes.&#8221; Illegal pyramid schemes compensate participants primarily for the introduction or enrollment of additional participants into the program. Often these schemes are characterized by large up-front entry or sign-up fees, over-priced products of low value, little or no emphasis on the sale or use of products, high-pressure recruiting tactics and claims of huge and quick financial rewards with little or no effort. Generally, these laws are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within such sales organizations is based on sales of products.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that our network marketing system satisfies the standards and case law defining a legal marketing system. It is an ongoing part of our business to monitor and respond to regulatory and legal developments, including those that may affect our network marketing system. However, the regulatory and legal requirements concerning network marketing systems do not include &#8220;bright line&#8221; rules and are inherently fact-based.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The business of developing and distributing nutritional products such as those we offer is highly competitive. Numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers compete for consumers and, in the case of other network marketing companies, for distributors. Our competitors include both network marketing companies such as Alticor Inc. (Amway Corp.), Avon Products Inc., Herbalife Ltd., Mary Kay Inc., Melaleuca, Inc., Mannatech, Inc., Nature&#8217;s Sunshine Products Inc., NuSkin Enterprises Inc. and USANA Health Sciences Inc., as well as specialty and mass retail establishments. Our ability to remain competitive depends on the underlying science and high quality of our products and our success in recruiting and retaining distributors. The pool of individuals interested in network marketing tends to be limited in each market and may be reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses. We believe that we offer a rewarding compensation plan with attractive financial benefits to compete for the time, attention and commitment of distributors. Our compensation plan is seamless, permitting international expansion.
