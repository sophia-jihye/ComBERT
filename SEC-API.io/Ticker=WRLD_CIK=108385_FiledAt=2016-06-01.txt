 Item 1. 

Description of Business 

General. The Company is one of the nation's largest small-loan consumer finance companies, offering short-term small installment loans, medium-term larger installment loans, related credit insurance and ancillary products and services to individuals. The Company offers standardized installment loans generally between $300 and $4,000 through 1,339 &#32;branches in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Mexico as of March 31, 2016 . The Company generally serves individuals with limited access to other sources of consumer credit, such as banks, credit unions, other consumer finance businesses and credit card lenders. In our U.S. branches, the Company also offers income tax return preparation services to its loan customers and other individuals. 

The small-loan consumer finance industry is a highly fragmented segment of the consumer lending industry. Small-loan consumer finance companies generally make loans to individuals of less than $2,000 with maturities of 18 months or less. These companies approve loans on the basis of the personal creditworthiness of their customers and maintain close contact with borrowers to encourage the repayment or, when appropriate to meet the borrower&#8217;s needs, the refinancing of loans. By contrast, commercial banks, credit unions and other consumer finance businesses typically make loans of more than $5,000 with maturities of more than one year. Those financial institutions generally approve consumer loans on the security of qualifying personal property pledged as collateral or impose more stringent credit requirements than those of small-loan consumer finance companies. As a result of their higher credit standards and specific collateral requirements, commercial banks, savings and loans and other consumer finance businesses typically charge lower interest rates and fees and experience lower delinquency and charge-off rates than do small-loan consumer finance companies. Small-loan consumer finance companies generally charge higher interest rates and fees to compensate for the greater credit risk of delinquencies and charge-offs and increased loan administration and collection costs. 

The majority of the participants in the industry are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches. We believe that competition between small-loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships, customer service and reputation in the local community rather than pricing, as participants in this industry generally charge interest rates and fees at, or close to, the maximum permitted by applicable state laws. We believe that our relatively large size affords us a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing our access to, and reducing our cost of, capital. 

Small-loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal and state statutes, ordinances and regulations. Consumer loan offices are licensed under state laws, which, in many states, establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees and other charges. In addition, state laws govern other aspects of the operation of small-loan consumer finance companies. Periodically, constituencies within states seek to enact stricter regulations that would affect our business. Furthermore, the industry is subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect lending operations. These federal laws require companies to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower in accordance with specified standards prior to the consummation of the loan transaction. Federal laws also prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices and proscribe unfair, deceptive or abusive credit practices. 

Expansion. During fiscal 2016 , the Company opened 37 new branches. No branches were purchased and 18 branches were merged into existing branches due to their inability to grow to profitable levels. In fiscal 2017 , the Company currently plans to open or acquire at least 15 &#32;new branches in the United States by increasing the number of branches in its existing market areas or commencing operations in new states where it believes demographic profiles and state regulations are attractive. In addition, the Company plans to open approximately 10 &#32;new branches in Mexico in fiscal 2017 . The Company's ability to continue existing operations and expand its operations in existing or new states is dependent upon, among other things, laws and regulations that permit the Company to operate its business profitably and its ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses; however, there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not change in ways that adversely affect the Company or that the Company will be able to obtain any such approvals or consents. See Part 1, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a further discussion of risks to our business and plans for expansion. 

The Company's expansion is also dependent upon its ability to identify attractive locations for new branches and to hire suitable personnel to staff, manage and supervise new branches. In evaluating a particular community, the Company examines several factors, including the demographic profile of the community, the existence of an established small-loan consumer finance market and the availability of suitable personnel. The Company generally locates new branches in communities already served by at least one other small-loan consumer finance company.

Loan and Other Products. In each state in which we operate, as well as in Mexico, we primarily offer pre-computed consumer installment loans that are standardized by amount and maturity. Consumer installment loans are our principal product and accounted for 88.8%, 85.9% and 87.4% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our loans are payable in fully-amortizing monthly installments with terms generally from 6 to 36 months, and are prepayable at any time without penalty. In fiscal 2016 , the Company's average originated gross loan size and term were approximately $1,376 and 13 months, respectively. As of March 31, 2016 , small loans generated in our U.S. branches averaged $926, ranged in size from $200 to $3,600 and had an average term of 11 months. Large loans originated in the U.S. averaged $3,438, ranged in size from $1,500 to $13,500 and had an average term of 23 months. State laws regulate various aspects of lending terms, including the maximum loan amounts, the types and maximum amounts of fees and other costs that may be charged, and, in most cases, interest rates. In addition to installment loans, we also offer payroll deduct loans in Mexico. Payroll deduct loans are originated through state unions and exhibit lower loss rates than installment loans. As of March 31, 2016 , payroll deduct loans originated in our Mexico branches averaged $1,688, ranged in size from $290 to $11,599 and had an average term of 32 months. Installment loans originated in Mexico averaged $412, ranged in size from $232 to $1,160 and had an average term of 12 months. 

Specific allowable interest, fees and other charges vary by state and, consistent with industry practice, we generally charge at, or close to, the maximum rates allowable under applicable state law in those states that limit loan rates. The finance charge is a combination of origination or acquisition fees, account maintenance fees, monthly account handling fees, interest and other charges permitted by the relevant state laws. As of March 31, 2016 , the annual percentage rates on loans we offer in the U.S., including interest, fees and other charges as calculated in accordance with the Federal Truth in Lending Act, ranged from 25% to 199%, depending on the loan size, maturity and the state in which the loan was made. 

As of March 31, 2016 , annual percentage rates applicable to our gross loans receivable, as defined by the Truth in Lending Act were as follows:

The Company, as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company, markets and sells credit life, credit accident and health, credit property, and unemployment insurance in connection with its loans in selected states where the sale of such insurance is permitted by law. Credit life insurance provides for the payment in full of the borrower's credit obligation to the lender in the event of death. Credit accident and health insurance provides for repayment of loan installments to the lender that come due during the insured's period of income interruption resulting from disability from illness or injury. Credit property insurance insures payment of the borrower's credit obligation to the lender in the event that the personal property pledged as security by the borrower is damaged or destroyed by a covered event. Unemployment insurance provides for repayment of loan installments to the lender that come due during the insured&#8217;s period of involuntary unemployment. The Company offers credit insurance for all loans originated in Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, and Mississippi and on a more limited basis in Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Texas. Customers in those states typically obtain such credit insurance through the Company. Charges for such credit insurance are made at filed, authorized rates and are stated separately in the Company's disclosure to customers, as required by the Truth in Lending Act and by various applicable state laws. In the sale of insurance policies, the Company, as an agent, writes policies only within limitations established by its agency contracts with the insurer. The Company does not sell credit insurance to non-borrowers. 

The Company also offers automobile club memberships to its borrowers in Georgia, Tennessee, New Mexico, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Mississippi as an agent for an unaffiliated automobile club. Club memberships entitle members to automobile breakdown, towing reimbursement and related services. The Company is paid a commission on each membership sold, but has no responsibility for administering the club, paying benefits or providing services to club members. The Company does not market automobile club memberships to non-borrowers but occasionally sells memberships to non-borrowers.

&#160;(1) Credit insurance is offered for certain loans. 

Another service offered by the Company is income tax return preparation and electronic filing. This program is provided in all but a few of the Company&#8217;s U.S branches. The Company prepared approximately 63,000 , 56,000 &#32;and 55,000 &#32;returns in each of the fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Net revenue generated by the Company from this program during fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;amounted to approximately $11.9 million , $9.9 million &#32;and $9.1 million , respectively. The Company believes that this is a beneficial service for its existing customer base, as well as non-loan customers, and it plans to continue to promote this program. 

The Company's World Class Buying Club program offered certain electronic products and appliances to its borrowers in Texas, 

Georgia, Tennessee, New Mexico, and Missouri. Borrowers participating in this program could purchase a product from a limited selection of items maintained in the branches or offered through a catalog available at a branch and could finance the purchase with a retail installment sales contract provided by the Company. Other than the limited product samples maintained in the branches, products sold through this program were shipped directly by the suppliers to the Company's customers and, accordingly, the Company was not required to maintain a large inventory to support the program. The Company decided to wind down the World Class Buying Club program during our fiscal 2015 third quarter. As of March 31, 2015, the Company is no longer financing the purchase of products through the program. We will continue to service the outstanding retail installment sales contracts.

For further information regarding potential risks associated with the Company&#8217;s operations in Mexico, see Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8211;Our continued expansion into Mexico may increase the risks inherent in conducting operations internationally and in Mexico, contribute materially to increased costs and negatively affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition,&#8221; and &#8220;&#8211;Our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk,&#8221; as well as Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#8211;Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.&#8221; 

Seasonality . The Company's highest loan demand occurs generally from October through December, its third fiscal quarter. Loan demand is generally lowest and loan repayment highest from January to March, its fourth fiscal quarter. Consequently, the Company experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in its operating results and cash needs. Operating results from the Company's third fiscal quarter are generally lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are generally higher than in other quarters. 

Lending and Collection Operations. The Company seeks to provide short-term consumer installment loans to the segment of the population that has limited access to other sources of credit. In evaluating the creditworthiness of potential customers, the Company primarily examines the individual's discretionary income, length of current employment and/or sources of income, duration of residence and prior credit experience. Loans are made to individuals on the basis of their discretionary income and other factors and are limited to amounts we believe that customers can reasonably be expected to repay from that income given our assessment of their stability, ability and willingness to pay. All loan applicants are required to complete standardized credit applications in person or by telephone at local Company branches. Each of the Company's local branches are equipped to perform rapid background, employment and credit checks and approve loan applications promptly, often while the customer waits. The Company's employees verify the applicant's sources of income and credit histories through telephone checks with employers, other employment 

references and verification with various credit bureaus. Substantially all new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will serve as collateral to secure the loan, but the Company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral. Accordingly, if the customer were to default in the repayment of the loan, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding loan balance by resorting to the sale of collateral. 

The Company believes that development and continual reinforcement of personal relationships with customers improve the Company's ability to monitor their creditworthiness, reduce credit risk and generate customer loyalty. It is not unusual for the Company to have made a number of loans to the same customer over the course of several years, many of which were refinanced with a new loan after the borrower had reduced the existing loan's outstanding balance by making multiple payments. In determining whether to refinance existing loans, the Company typically requires loans to be current on a recency basis, and repeat customers are generally required to complete a new credit application if they have not completed one within the prior two years. 

In fiscal 2016 , approximately 81.5% of the Company's loans were generated through refinancings of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers. A refinancing represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer. The Company markets the opportunity for qualifying customers to refinance existing loans prior to maturity. In many cases the existing customer&#8217;s past performance and established creditworthiness with the Company qualifies that customer for a larger loan. This, in turn, may increase the fees and other income realized for a particular customer. For fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the percentages of the Company's loan originations that were refinancings of existing loans were 69.4%, 71.5% and 73.5%, respectively. 

The Company allows refinancing of delinquent loans on a case-by-case basis for those customers who otherwise satisfy the Company's credit standards. Each such refinancing is carefully examined before approval in an effort to avoid increasing credit risk. A delinquent loan may generally be refinanced only if the customer has made payments which, together with any credits of insurance premiums or other charges to which the customer is entitled in connection with the refinancing, reduce the balance due on the loan to an amount equal to or less than the original cash advance made in connection with the loan. The Company does not allow the amount of the new loan to exceed the original amount of the existing loan. The Company believes that refinancing delinquent loans for certain customers who have made periodic payments allows the Company to increase its average loans outstanding and its interest, fees and other income without experiencing a significant increase in loan losses. These refinancings also provide a resolution to temporary financial setbacks for these borrowers and sustain their credit rating. Because they are allowed on a selective basis only, refinancings of delinquent loans represented 1.4% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s loan volume in fiscal 2016 . 

To reduce late payment risk, local branch staff encourage customers to inform the Company in advance of expected payment problems. Local branch staff also promptly contact delinquent customers following any payment due date and thereafter remain in close contact with such customers through phone calls or letters until payment is received or some other resolution is reached. Company employees are instructed not to accept payment outside of the Company's branches except in unusual circumstances. In Georgia, Oklahoma, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Indiana and Idaho the Company is permitted under state laws to garnish customers' wages for repayment of loans, but the Company does not otherwise generally resort to litigation for collection purposes, and rarely attempts to foreclose on collateral. 

Insurance-related Operations. In certain states, the Company sells credit insurance to customers in connection with its loans as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company. These insurance policies provide for the payment of the outstanding balance of the Company's loan upon the occurrence of an insured event. The Company earns a commission on the sale of such credit insurance, which, for most products, is directly impacted by the claims experience of the insurance company on policies sold on its behalf by the Company. In states where commissions on certain products are capped, the commission earned is not directly impacted by the claims experience. 

The Company has a wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary that reinsures a portion of the credit insurance sold in connection with loans made by the Company. Certain coverages currently sold by the Company on behalf of the unaffiliated insurance carrier are ceded by the carrier to the captive insurance subsidiary, providing the Company with an additional source of income derived from the earned reinsurance premiums. In fiscal 2016 , the captive insurance subsidiary reinsured approximately 7.0% of the credit insurance sold by the Company and contributed approximately $3.6 million to the Company's total revenue. 

Non-Filing Insurance. The Company typically does not perfect its security interest in collateral securing its smaller loans by filing Uniform Commercial Code (&#8220;UCC&#8221;) financing statements. Statutes in Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Kentucky and Alabama permit the Company to charge a non-filing or non-recording insurance premium in connection with certain loans originated in these states. These premiums are equal in aggregate amount to the premiums paid by the Company to purchase non-filing insurance 

coverage from an unaffiliated insurance company. Under its non-filing insurance coverage, the Company is reimbursed for losses on loans resulting from its policy not to perfect its security interest in collateral securing the loans. 

Information Technology. &#32;ParaData Financial Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is a financial services software company headquartered near St. Louis, Missouri. Using the proprietary data processing software package developed by ParaData, the Company is able to fully automate all of its loan account processing and collection reporting. The system provides thorough management information and control capabilities. ParaData also markets its financial services data processing system to other financial services companies, but experiences significant fluctuations from year to year in the amount of revenues generated from sales of the system to third parties. Such revenues have historically not been material to the Company. 

Monitoring and Supervision. The Company's loan operations are organized into Southeastern, Central, and Western Divisions, and Mexico. The Southeastern Division consists of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee; the Central Division consists of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin; and the Western Division consists of Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. Several levels of management monitor and supervise the operations of each of the Company's branches. Branch managers are directly responsible for the performance of their respective branches. District supervisors are responsible for the performance of 8 to 11 branches in their districts, typically communicate with the branch managers of each of their branches at least weekly and visit the branches at least monthly. The Vice Presidents of Operations monitor the performance of all branches within their states (or partial state in the case of Texas), primarily through communication with district supervisors. These Vice Presidents of Operations typically communicate with the district supervisors of each of their districts weekly and regularly visit branches. 

Senior management receives daily delinquency, loan volume, charge-off, and other statistical reports consolidated by state and has access to these daily reports for each branch. At least six times per fiscal year, district supervisors examine the operations of each branch in their geographic area and submit standardized reports detailing their findings to the Company's senior management. At least once per year, each branch undergoes an audit by the Company's internal auditors. These audits include an examination of cash balances and compliance with Company loan approval, review and collection procedures and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. 

Staff and Training. Local branches are generally staffed with three to four employees. The branch manager supervises operations of the branch and is responsible for approving all new and former borrower loan applications and requests for increases in the amount of credit extended. Each branch generally has one or two branch service representatives who take loan applications, process loan applications, apply payments, and assist in the preparation of operational reports, in collection efforts, and in marketing activities. Larger branches may employ additional branch service representatives. 

New employees are required to review detailed training materials that outline the Company's operating policies and procedures. The Company tests each employee on the training materials during the first year of employment. In addition, each branch provides in-office training sessions once every week and periodic training sessions outside the branch. The Company has also implemented an enhanced training tool known as World University, which provides continuous, real-time, effective, on-line training to all locations. This allows for more training opportunities to be available to all employees throughout the course of their career with the Company. 

Advertising. The Company actively advertises through direct mail, targeting both its present and former customers and potential customers who have used other sources of consumer credit. The Company obtains or acquires mailing lists from third party sources. In addition to the general promotion of its loans for vacations, back-to-school needs and other uses, the Company advertises extensively during the October through December holiday season and in connection with new branch openings. The Company also advertises on-line, by email and to existing customers via SMS/text. The Company believes its advertising contributes significantly to its ability to compete effectively with other providers of small-loan consumer credit. Advertising expenses were approximately 3.0% of total revenues in fiscal 2016 , 2.8% in fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2.7% in fiscal 2014 . 

Competition . The small-loan consumer finance industry is highly fragmented, with numerous competitors. The majority of the Company's competitors are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches. Competition from community banks and credit unions is limited because they typically do not make loans of less than $5,000. While it is hard to surmise exactly what impact our competitors have on our business, we believe that factors such as online lending could be affecting the business market within which we operate. Additionally, although online lenders appear to be marketing to a different customer segment than that of our primary customers, some of our customers may in fact overlap. 

The Company believes that competition between small-loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships, customer service and reputation in the local community, rather than pricing, as participants in this industry generally charge interest rates and fees at or close to the maximum permitted by applicable laws. The Company 

believes that its relatively larger size affords it a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing its access to, and reducing its cost of, capital. 

Several of the states in which the Company currently operates limit the size of loans made by small-loan consumer finance companies and prohibit the extension of more than one loan to a customer by any one company. As a result, many customers borrow from more than one finance company, enabling the Company, subject to the limitations of various consumer protection and privacy statutes including, but not limited to, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to obtain information on the credit history of specific customers from other consumer finance companies. 

Employees . As of March 31, 2016 , the Company had 3,345 U.S. employees, none of whom were represented by labor unions and 1,091 employees in Mexico, all of whom were represented by a Mexico-based labor union. The Company considers its relations with its personnel to be good. The Company seeks to hire people who will become long-term employees. The Company experiences a high level of turnover among its entry-level personnel, which the Company believes is typical of the small-loan consumer finance industry. 

Executive Officers of the Company . The names and ages, positions, terms of office and periods of service of each of the Company's executive officers (and other business experience for executive officers who have served as such for less than five years) are set forth below. The term of office for each executive officer expires upon the earlier of the appointment and qualification of a successor or such officers' death, resignation, retirement or removal.

Government Regulation . 

U. S. Operations . Small-loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal and state statutes, ordinances and regulations. In many cases, these statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees and other charges. In addition, state laws regulate collection procedures, the keeping of books and records and other aspects of the operation of small-loan consumer finance companies. Generally, state regulations also establish minimum capital requirements for each local branch. Accordingly, the ability of the Company to expand by acquiring existing branches and opening new branches will depend in part on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. 

For example, Texas regulation requires the approval of the Texas Consumer Credit Commissioner for the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company. A Louisiana statute prohibits any person from acquiring control of 50% or more of the shares of stock of a licensed consumer lender, such as the Company, without first obtaining a license as a consumer lender. The overall effect of these laws, and similar laws in other states, is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of an unregulated corporation. 

All of the Company's branches are licensed under the laws of the state in which the branch is located. Licenses granted by the regulatory agencies in these states are subject to renewal every year and may be revoked for failure to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. In the states in which the Company currently operates, licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing. 

The Company and its operations are regulated by several state agencies, including the following: 

&#8226; 

The Industrial Loan Division of the Office of the Georgia Insurance Commissioner 

&#8226; 

The Consumer Finance Division of the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions and the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs 

&#8226; 

The Texas Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner 

&#8226; 

The Oklahoma Department of Consumer Credit 

&#8226; 

The Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Missouri Division of Finance 

&#8226; 

The Consumer Credit Division of the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Financial Institutions Division of the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department 

&#8226; 

The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Alabama State Banking Department 

&#8226; 

The Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions 

&#8226; 

The Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance 

&#8226; 

The Idaho Department of Finance. 

These state regulatory agencies audit the Company's local branches from time to time, and each state agency performs an annual compliance audit of the Company's operations in that state. 

Insurance . The Company is also subject to state regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which it sells credit insurance. State insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed, govern the commissions that may be paid to agents in connection with the sale of credit insurance and limit the premium amount charged for such insurance. The Company's captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the Turks and Caicos Islands of the British West Indies, where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled. 

Consumer finance companies are affected by changes in state and federal statutes and regulations. &#32;The Company actively participates in trade associations and in lobbying efforts in the states in which it operates and at the federal level. There have been, and the Company expects that there will continue to be, media attention, initiatives, discussions, proposals and legislation regarding the entire consumer credit industry, as well as our particular business, and possible significant changes to the laws and regulations, or the authority exercised pursuant to those laws and regulations that govern our business. In some cases, proposed or pending legislative or regulatory changes have been introduced that would, if enacted, have a material adverse effect on, or possibly even eliminate, our ability to continue our current business. We can give no assurance that the laws and regulations that govern our business, or the interpretation or administration of those laws and regulations, will remain unchanged or that any such future changes will not materially and adversely affect or in the worst case, eliminate, the Company&#8217;s lending practices, operations, profitability or prospects. See "State legislation" and &#8220;Federal legislation&#8221; below and Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; for a further discussion of the potential impact of regulatory changes on our business. 

State legislation. The Company is subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans, lending forms and operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary or other penalties. 

In the past, several state legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced which, had they become law, would have had a material adverse impact on our operations and ability to continue to conduct business in the relevant state. Although to date none of these state initiatives have been successful, state legislatures continue to receive pressure to adopt similar legislation that would affect our lending operations. For example, in Missouri, following a 2013 failed ballot initiative, the same proponents again commenced ballot initiatives to legislatively cap annual interest rates at 36% and to constitutionally impose other interest rate limitations. The proponents of the rate cap did not obtain sufficient signatures on this initiative to have it placed on the November 2014 election ballot. A similar attempt to introduce rate cap legislation has been initiated in New Mexico, but was tabled in early February 2015 by a legislative subcommittee. There can be no assurance that proponents of these or similar initiatives will not pursue them and be successful in the future. 

&#160; 

In addition, any adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or any adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate, could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or could lower or eliminate the profitability of our operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, then in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would also incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments, and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs. 

Federal legislation . In addition to state and local laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations. These laws include the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the regulations thereunder and the Federal Trade Commission's Credit Practices Rule. These laws require the Company to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower, prior to the consummation of the loan transaction, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive credit practices. Among the principal disclosure items under the Truth in Lending Act are the terms of repayment, the final maturity, the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each loan. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against loan applicants on, among other things the basis of race, color, sex, age or marital status. Pursuant to Regulation B promulgated under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection. The Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires the Company to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency and to provide additional information to those borrowers whose loans are approved and consummated if the credit decision was based in whole or in part on the contents of a credit report. The Credit Practices Rule limits the types of property a creditor may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan. Violations of the statutes and regulations described above may result in actions for damages, claims for refund of payments made, certain fines and penalties, injunctions against certain practices and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans. 

Although these laws and regulations remained substantially unchanged for many years, over the last several years the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities have been under review and are subject to change as a result of various developments and changes in economic conditions, the make-up of the executive and legislative branches of government, and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors - Media and public perception of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition&#8221; below. Any changes in such laws and regulations could force us to modify, suspend or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. 

Various legislative proposals addressing consumer credit transactions have been passed in recent years or are currently pending in the U.S. Congress. Congressional members continue to receive pressure from consumer activists and other industry opposition groups to adopt legislation to address various aspects of consumer credit transactions. As part of a sweeping package of financial industry reform regulations, in July 2010 Congress passed and the President signed into law the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&#8221; (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). This created, among other things, a new federal regulatory entity, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (commonly referred to as the CFPB), with sweeping regulatory and enforcement over consumer financial transactions. The CFPB continues to actively engage in the announcement and implementation of various plans and initiatives in the area of consumer financial transactions generally, including its March 26, 2015 announcement that it was considering proposing rules under its unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices rulemaking authority relating to payday, vehicle title, and similar loans. Some of these CFPB announced plans and initiatives, if implemented, would directly affect certain loan products we currently offer and subject us to the CFPB&#8217;s supervisory authority. Also, as previously disclosed, the Company is currently under investigation by the CFPB. See Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,&#8221; for more information regarding the CFPB investigation and its regulatory initiatives, including a discussion of proposed rulemaking announced by the CFPB on March 26, 2015. 

Although the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits the CFPB from setting interest rates on consumer loans, efforts to create a federal usury cap, applicable to all consumer credit transactions and substantially below rates at which the Company could continue to operate profitably, are still ongoing. Any federal legislative or regulatory action that severely restricts or prohibits the provision of small-loan consumer credit and similar services on terms substantially similar to those we currently provide would, if enacted, have a material, adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Any federal law that would impose a national 36% or similar annualized credit rate cap on our services would, if enacted, almost certainly eliminate our ability to continue our current operations. See Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors - Federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings, or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend or cease part or all of our nationwide operations,&#8221; for further information regarding the potential impact of adverse legislative and regulatory changes. 

Mexico Operations. Effective May 1, 2008, World Acceptance Corporation de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. was converted to WAC de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., SOFOM, E.N.R. (&#8220;WAC de Mexico SOFOM&#8221;), and due to such conversion, this entity is now organized as a Sociedad Financiera de Objeto M&#250;ltiple, Entidad No Regulada (Multiple Purpose Financial Company, Non-Regulated Entity or &#8220;SOFOM, ENR&#8221;). Mexican law provides for administrative regulation of companies which are organized as SOFOM, ENRs. As such, WAC de Mexico SOFOM is mainly governed by different federal statutes, including the General Law of Auxiliary Credit Activities and Organizations, the Law for the Transparency and Order of Financial Services, the General Law of Credit Instruments and Operations, and the Law of Protection and Defense to the User of Financial Services. SOFOM, ENRs are also subject to regulation by and surveillance of the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services (&#8220;CONDUSEF&#8221;). CONDUSEF, among others, acts as mediator and arbitrator in disputes between financial lenders and customers, and resolves claims filed by loan customers. CONDUSEF also prevents unfair and discriminatory lending practices, and regulates, among others, the form of loan contracts, consumer disclosures, advertisement, and certain operating procedures of SOFOM, ENRs, with such regulations pertaining primarily to consumer protection and adequate disclosure and transparency in the terms of borrowing. Neither CONDUSEF nor federal statutes impose interest rate caps on loans granted by SOFOM, ENRs. Due to anti-money laundering laws, we are now being reviewed by the National Banking and Securities Commission ("CNBV") for compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. The consumer loan industry, as with most businesses in Mexico, is also subject to other various regulations in the areas of tax compliance and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. Generally, federal regulations control over the state statutes with respect to the consumer loan operations of SOFOM, ENRs. 

Available Information . The information regarding our website and availability of our filings with the SEC as described in the second paragraph under &#8220;Introduction&#8221; above is incorporated by reference into this Item 1 of Part I.
