 ITEM 1&#8212;BUSINESS

General

Huttig Building Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1913, was founded in 1885 and is a leading domestic distributor of millwork, building materials and wood products used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement, remodeling and repair work. We purchase from leading manufacturers and distribute our products through 26 wholesale distribution centers serving 41 states. Our distribution centers sell principally to building materials dealers, national buying groups, home centers and industrial users, including makers of manufactured homes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated net sales of $659.6 million.

We conduct our business through a two-step distribution model. This means we resell the products we purchase from manufacturers to our customers, who then sell the products to the final end users, who are typically professional builders and independent contractors engaged in residential construction and remodeling projects, or consumers engaged in do-it-yourself remodeling projects.

Our products fall into three categories: (i) millwork, which includes doors, windows, moulding, stair parts and columns, (ii) general building products, which include composite decking, connectors, fasteners, housewrap, roofing products and insulation, and (iii) wood products, which include engineered wood products, such as floor systems, as well as wood panels and lumber.

Doors and engineered wood products often require an intermediate value added service between the time the product leaves the manufacturer and before it is delivered to the final customer. We perform such services, on behalf of our customers, which include pre-hanging exterior and interior door units, prefinishing exterior door units and cutting engineered wood products from standard lengths to job-specific requirements. In addition, with respect to the majority of our products, we have the capability to buy in bulk and disaggregate these large shipments to meet individual customer stocking requirements. For some products, we carry a depth and breadth of products that our customers cannot reasonably stock themselves. Our customers benefit from our business capabilities because they do not need to invest capital in door hanging facilities or cutting equipment, nor do they need to incur the costs associated with maintaining large inventories of products. Our size, broad geographic presence, extensive fleet and logistical capabilities enable us to purchase products in large volumes at favorable prices, stock a wide range of products for rapid delivery and manage inventory in a reliable, efficient manner.

We serve our customers, whether they are a local dealer or a national account, through our 26 wholesale distribution centers. Our broad geographic footprint enables us to work with our customers and suppliers to ensure that local inventory levels, merchandising, purchasing and pricing are tailored to the requirements of each market. Each distribution center also has access to our single-platform nationwide inventory management system. This provides the local manager with real-time inventory availability and pricing information. We support our distribution centers with credit and financial management, training and marketing programs and human resources expertise. We believe that these distribution capabilities and efficiencies offer us a competitive advantage as compared to those of many local and regional competitors.

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this &#8220;Annual Report&#8221;), when we refer to &#8220;Huttig,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us,&#8221; we mean Huttig Building Products, Inc. and its subsidiary and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise.

Industry Characteristics and Trends

The residential building materials distribution industry is characterized by its substantial size, its highly fragmented ownership structure and an increasingly competitive environment. The industry can be broken into two categories: (i) new construction and (ii) home repair and remodeling.

Residential construction activity in both categories is closely linked to a variety of factors directly affected by general economic conditions, including employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, prices of commodity wood and steel products, immigration patterns, regional demographics and consumer confidence. We monitor a broad set of macroeconomic and regional indicators, including new housing starts and permit issuances, as indicators of our potential future sales volume.

New housing activity in the United States has shown modest im provement each year since 2009, the trough period of the recent housing downturn. However, 2015 activity was still below the historical average of total housing starts from 1959 to 2015 of approximately 1.4 million starts based on statistics tracked by th e U.S. Census Bureau (&#8220;Historical Average&#8221;). Total new housing starts in the United States were approximately 1.1 million, 1.0 million and 0.9 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Single family starts were 0.7 million, 0.6 million and 0.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total spending on new single family residential construction was $ 219 billion, $19 4 billion and $171 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, resp ectively. 

We service large local, regional and national independent building products dealers, specialty dealers, and home centers who in turn sell to contractors, professional builders, and consumers. These large local, regional and national building products dealers, often referred to as &#8220;pro dealers,&#8221; continue to distribute a significant portion of the residential building materials sold in the United States. These pro dealers operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Consolidation among building products manufacturers favors distributors that can buy in bulk and break down large production runs to specific local requirements. In addition, increasing scale and sophistication among professional builders and contractors places a premium on pro dealers that can make a wide variety of building products readily available at competitive prices. In response to the increasingly competitive environment for building products, many pro dealers have either consolidated or formed buying groups in order to increase their purchasing power and/or service levels. 

We service the national home centers through special order programs of branded products in both millwork and building products. These programs continue to grow each year, as manufacturers develop special order programs through these retailers and utilize our value added service model and broad distribution network to support these programs locally.

We believe the evolving characteristics of the residential building materials distribution industry, particularly the consolidation trend, favor companies like us that operate nationally and have significant infrastructure in place to accommodate the needs of customers across geographic regions. We believe we are the only national distributor of millwork products. Our wide geographic presence, size, purchasing power, material handling efficiencies and investment in millwork services, position us well to serve the needs of the consolidating pro dealer community.

Products

Our goal is to offer products that allow us to provide value to our customers, either by performing incremental services on the products before delivering them to customers, buying products in bulk and disaggregating them for individual customers or carrying a depth and breadth of products that customers cannot reasonably stock themselves at each location. Our products can be classified into three main categories:

&#160;

&#183; 

Millwork, including exterior and interior doors, pre-hung door units, windows, patio doors, mouldings, frames, stair parts and columns. Key brands in this product category include Therma-Tru, Masonite, Woodgrain Doors, HB&#38;G, Simpson Door, Windsor Windows, and Rogue Valley Door; 

&#160;

&#183; 

General building products, such as roofing, siding, insulation, flashing, housewrap, connectors and fasteners, decking, railings, drywall, kitchen cabinets and other miscellaneous building products. Key brands in this product category include Louisiana Pacific, Simpson Strong-Tie, Timbertech, AZEK, BP Roofing, Grace, Fiberon, RDI, Owens Corning, Typar, Atlas Roofing, Alpha Protech, and Maibec; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Wood products, including engineered wood products, such as floor systems, and other wood products, such as lumber and wood panels. Within the wood products category, engineered wood continues to be a focus product for us. The engineered wood product line offers us the ability to provide our customers with value-added services, such as floor system take-offs, cut-to-length packages and just-in-time, cross-dock delivery capabilities. 

The following table sets forth information regarding the percentage of our net sales represented by our principal product categories sold during each of the prior three years. While the table below generally indicates the mix of our sales by product category, changes in the prices of commodity wood products and in unit volumes sold could affect our product mix on a year-to-year basis.

Customers 

During 2015, we served approximately 3,700 customers, with one customer - Lumbermen&#8217;s Merchandising Corporation (&#8220;LMC&#8221;) - accounting for 13% of our sales in 2015 and 12% in each of 2014 and 2013. LMC is a buying group representing multiple building material dealers. Building materials pro dealers represent our single largest customer group. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 40% of our total sales in 2015.

Within the pro dealer category, a large percentage of our sales are to national accounts, including buying groups. These are large pro dealers, or groups of pro dealers, that generally operate in more than one state or region. We also sell to short line specialty dealers that focus on specific segments of the building industry, national retail home centers, and manufactured housing. We believe that our size, which lets us purchase in bulk, achieve operating efficiencies, operate on a national scale and offer competitive pricing, makes us well suited to service the various segments of the dealer community. Our sales to national accounts, including buying groups, were 43% of our total sales in 2015 and 42% in each of 2014 and 2013.

Organization

Huttig operates on a nationwide basis. Customer sales are conducted through 26 distribution centers serving 41 states. Administrative and executive management functions are centralized at our headquarters office located in St. Louis, Missouri. We believe that this structure permits us to be closer to our customers and serve them better, while being able to take advantage of certain efficiencies of scale that come from our size.

Headquarter functions include those activities that can be shared across our full distribution platform. These include financial management, information technology, human resources, legal, internal audit and investor relations along with small corporate operations, marketing and product management groups.

Operating responsibility resides with each distribution center&#8217;s general manager. The general manager assumes responsibility for daily operations, including sales, purchasing, personnel and logistics. Each distribution center generally maintains its own sales, warehouse and logistic personnel supported by a small administrative team.

Sales

Sales responsibility principally lies with general managers at our distribution centers. The sales function is generally divided into two channels: outside sales and inside sales. Our outside field representatives make on-site calls to local and regional customers. Our inside sales people generally receive and enter orders from customers and support our outside sales function. In addition, we maintain a national account sales team to serve national customers. Our outside sales force is generally compensated by a base salary or draw plus commissions determined primarily on profit margin.

Distribution Strategy and Operations

We conduct our business through a two-step distribution model. This means that we resell the products that we purchase from manufacturers to our customers, who then sell the products to the final end user. Our principal customer is the pro dealer. We also sell to the retail home centers and certain industrial users, such as makers of manufactured housing.

Despite our nationwide reach, the local distribution center is still a principal focus of our operations, and we tailor our business to meet local demand and customer needs. We customize product selection, inventory levels, service offerings and prices to meet local market requirements. We support this strategy through our single platform information technology system. This system provides each distribution center&#8217;s general manager real-time access to pricing, inventory availability and margin analysis. This system provides product information both for that location and across our entire network of distribution centers. More broadly, our sales force, in conjunction with our product management teams, works with our suppliers and customers to determine the appropriate mix, quantity and pricing of products suited to each local market.

We purchased products from more than 700 different suppliers in 2015. We generally negotiate with our major suppliers on a national basis to leverage our total volume purchasing power, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our locally based competitors. The majority of our purchases are made from suppliers that offer payment discounts and volume related incentive programs. Although we generally do not have exclusive distribution rights for our key products and we do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers, we believe our national footprint, buying power and distribution network make us an attractive distributor for many manufacturers. Moreover, we have long-standing relationships with many of our key suppliers.

We regularly evaluate opportunities to introduce new products. This is primarily driven by customer demand or market requirements. We have found that customers gener ally welcome a greater breadth of product offering as it can improve their purchasing and operating efficiencies by providing for &#8220;one stop&#8221; shopping. Similarly, selectively broadening our product offering enables us to drive additional products through ou r distribution system, thereby increasing the efficiency of our operations by better utilizing our existing infrastructure. 

We focus on selling respected, brand name products. We believe that brand awareness is an increasingly important factor in building products purchasing decisions. We generally benefit from the quality levels, marketing initiatives and product support provided by manufacturers of branded products. We also benefit from the positive attributes that customers typically equate with branded products.

Competition

We compete with many local and regional building product distributors and, in certain markets and product categories, with national building product distributors. In certain markets, we also compete with national building materials suppliers with national distribution capabilities. We distribute products for some manufacturers that also engage in direct sales.

The principal factors on which we compete are pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist with problem solving, customer relationships, geographic coverage and breadth of product offerings.

Our size and geographic coverage are advantageous in obtaining and retaining distribution rights for brand name products. Our size also permits us to attract experienced sales and service personnel and gives us the resources to provide company-wide sales, product and service training programs. By working closely with our customers and suppliers and utilizing our single information technology platform, we believe our branches are well positioned to maintain appropriate inventory levels and to deliver completed orders on time.

Seasonality, Market Conditions and Working Capital

Various cyclical and seasonal factors, such as general economic conditions and weather, historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period. Our size, extensive nationwide operating model, and the geographic diversity of our distribution centers to some extent mitigate our exposure to these cyclical and seasonal factors. These factors include levels of new construction, home improvement and remodeling activity, weather, interest rates and other local, regional and national economic conditions.

Our results of operations are affected by new housing activity in the United States. In 2015, total housing starts increased 11%, to 1.1 million, but were still below the Historical Average of approximately 1.4 million. Based on the current level of housing activity and industry forecasts, we expect new housing activity could continue to increase into 2016, though still remain below the Historical Average.

We anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. Our results in the first and fourth quarters are generally adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the Northeast, Midwest and Northwest, typically due to seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas. Because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year, our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters. In addition, other weather patterns, such as hurricane season in the Southeast region of the United States during the third and fourth quarters, can have an adverse impact on our results in a particular period.

We depend on cash flow from operating activities and funds available under our secured credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditures and any acquisitions that we may undertake. We typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters. Our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters, reflecting the seasonal nature of our business. The second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters, largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters. We maintain significant inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing, delivery and service terms with our suppliers. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, inventories and accounts receivable in the aggregate constituted approximately 68% and 74% of our total assets, respectively. We closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and, to the extent possible, manage variable operating costs to minimize the seasonal effects on our profitability.

Credit 

Huttig&#8217;s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and then delegates responsibility for most credit decisions to regional credit personnel. Our credit policies, together with careful monitoring of customer balances, have resulted in bad debt expense of less than 0.1% in each of 2015, 2014, and 2013. Approximately 98% of our sales in 2015 were to customers to whom we had provided credit for those sales.

Backlog

Our customers generally order products on an as-needed basis. As a result, a substantial portion of product shipments in a given fiscal quarter result from orders received in that same quarter. Consequently, order backlog represents only a very small percentage of the product sales that we anticipate in a given quarter and is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period.

Trade Names

Historically, Huttig has operated under various trade names in the markets we serve, retaining the names of acquired businesses for a period of time to preserve local identification. To capitalize on our national presence, all of our distribution centers operate under the primary trade name &#8220;Huttig Building Products.&#8221; Huttig has no material patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions other than the Huttig Building Products&#174; name and logo, which are registered trademarks.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance, or are taking action aimed at assuring material compliance, with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We are engaged in legal proceedings relating to contamination at our formerly owned property in Montana. See Part I, Item 3&#8212;&#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221;

In addition, some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred, and for which we, among others, could be held responsible. We currently believe that there are no material environmental liabilities at any of our distribution center locations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,000 people, of which approximately 14% were represented by eight unions. We have not experienced any significant strikes or other work interruptions in recent years and have maintained generally favorable relations with our employees. The Company has three union contracts covering approximately 8% of our employees which will require negotiation in 2016. See Part I, Item 1A&#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;
