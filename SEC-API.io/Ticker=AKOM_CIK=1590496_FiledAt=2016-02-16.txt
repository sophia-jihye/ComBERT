 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a web-based retailer of children's clothing, accessories and other personalized gifts for children. We currently sell products through our website www.polkadotpatch.com. We do not have any stores or outlets and hold no inventory. We are in the process of rebranding our current business name "polkadotpatch" to the name "Maple Tree Kids", with a goal of selling more personalized children products and expanding product customization choices to customers. We work with customers to personalize their gift selections to their specifications by placing a child's name, favorite colors and theme or picture design on the items they order to provide them and their children or others with a "you are special" experience.

&#160;

We are currently devoting a substantial amount of our efforts in marketing more of our suppliers' offerings of personalized children products. We are working on creating a new company logo, marketing and sales collateral, searching for sales personnel to sell more personalized children products through our current website and building our new website, www.mapletreekids.com, which is currently under construction. These corporate development efforts to rebrand our company by selling more personalized children's products to our current and future customers, through our new website and name "Maple Tree Kids". 

&#160;

Management's plans, due to the lack of sufficient financial resources for the Company, may include securing a suitable merger partner or acquiring private companies to create investment value for the Company. However, no assurance can be given that management will be successful in its efforts.

&#160;

We have sold our suppliers products to approximately 4,200 customers since our inception, including our largest customer, a large credit union bank that buys gifts for their customers when they have a newborn child, whom presently constitutes approximately 80% of our current business. We have approximately 35 wholesale suppliers that we can acquire products from, all based in the United States. During the period from the date of our inception - August 12, 2005 to December 31, 2015, we sold a total of $775,871 of products. Our product sales to date of personalized children products have not been significant. We generated net income of $13,289 from our inception date to December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sold a total of $10,052 and $13,985, respectively, worth of our products and generated net losses of $36,579 and $13,475, respectively.

&#160;

We do not manufacture any of our own products and did not keep any inventory of products in 2015. We have not entered into any formal supply agreements with our suppliers. We are required to pay in full for products purchased from our suppliers once we order the products from them. Once we receive an order from our customers we instruct our suppliers to drop-ship the purchased inventory directly to our customers. We require our customers to pre-pay for products purchased on our websites. The customer authorizes us to charge their credit card at the time of purchase with the understanding their credit card will be charged upon shipment and title will pass the customer upon shipment. 

&#160;

In September 2014 and October 2014 the Company sold in its registered public offering to 39 retail investors 1,108,500 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $22,170. The purchase price was $0.02 per common share and there were no offering costs paid in this registered offering. This registered public offering was closed on November 7, 2014.

Company History 

&#160;

We were incorporated on August 14, 2013 in the State of Nevada. Our corporate name is Maple Tree Kids, Inc. At the time of our incorporation, our president and sole stockholder, Irina Goldman, subscribed for and purchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000.

&#160;

We were incorporated in order to acquire by merger all of the limited liability company interests of Maple Tree Kids LLC, a Vermont limited liability company, or ("MTK LLC"). Our president had personally acquired all of the limited liability company interests of MTK LLC for a total purchase price of $8,800 on August 16, 2013. MTK LLC then merged with and into our company on September 26, 2013 pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of the same date. Our company was the surviving company in the merger and the separate existence of MTK LLC ceased and we succeeded to all of the assets of MTK LLC as a result of the merger. At the effective time of the merger, each limited liability company percentage interest in MTK LLC held by our president was automatically changed and converted into ten thousand shares of our common stock. Since our president owned 100% of the limited liability company interests in MTK LLC at the time of the merger, she received a total of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock as a result of the merger. In addition, on September 26, 2013, our president converted $5,000 of indebtedness that our company owed to her into common shares, at a par value of $0.001, by cancelling such debt in exchange for a total of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement dated as of such date.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company Status 

&#160;

We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have not made a decision whether to take advantage of any or all of these exemptions. If we do take advantage of any of these exemptions, we do not know if some investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result. The result may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act.

&#160;

We could remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

&#160;

In addition, Section 103 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company is not required to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404(b). This exemption is available to us as well as a smaller reporting company.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160;

In today's economy, buyers believe that a personalized gift will allow them to make a lasting impression at a reasonable cost. According to the 2013 Gifting Report, the gifting market - defined as items or experiences purchased to give as a gift - represents more than $1 out of every $10 spent at the general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, (GAFO), type of store. Americans of all ages love to see their name on a product. The personalized gift market is mainly a U.S. phenomenon, the roots of which can be traced to the early days when the family names or initials would be engraved on silver bowls and jewelry. In the early days personalization was only available to those who could afford it. With the development of new machinery and computerized technologies, personalized gifts that would take weeks to manufacture now can be shipped to the customers almost immediately.

&#160;

Faith Popcorn, founder of New York based marketing consultancy, Brain Reserve, who is a futurist and studies and reports on nationwide trends, has coined the word "egonomics" to describe the personalized product phenomenon. Ms. Popcorn and other trend forecasters agree that the personalized gift industry will continue steady growth as more products are brought to market in response to consumer demand.

&#160;

Buying and shopping for gifts is a big business. Today's gift retailers are expecting an increase in business in 2014 as compared to 2013. According to gift retailers responding to Gift &#38; Decorative Accessories' exclusive Today's Gift Retailer 2014 survey, 75% of gift retailers are projecting 2014 sales to be up or about the same as 2013 sales.

&#160;

In 2013, 37 percent of manufacturers were focusing on Millennials when developing new products and this year that number has jumped 20 percentage points to 57 percent. Two years ago there was a rise in the percentage of gift manufacturers targeting Younger Boomers, those between the ages of 50 and 58, from 54 percent in 2013 to 57 percent in 2014. This year the percentage of vendors reporting they will target Younger Boomers fell nine percentage points to 48 percent. Sandwiched between the large demographic groups of Baby Boomers and Millennials are Generation Xers, those ages 34 to 49. While its numbers are small, this group remains the number one target for gift manufacturers, with 62 percent reporting they will develop products geared towards this cohort.

&#160;

According to the data published by First Research in September 2013 US personal consumption expenditures at gift, novelty, and souvenir stores are forecast to grow at an annual compounded rate of 1 percent between 2013 and 2017. 

&#160;

According to the 2013 Gifts &#38; Decorative Accessories Trends and Forecast Survey, 43% of gift and decorative accessory vendors stated that they plan on creating products targeted at Millennials, also known as Generation Y. The 2010 Census revealed there are 56 million adult Millennials age 18 to 30. According to the survey, Millennials have a purchasing power of $170 billion.

&#160;

In total, this group is comprised of individuals born between 1981 and 2000, came of age in the new millennium and is considered the second largest age group behind Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. Millennials are known for multi-tasking, short attention spans and a constant need for stimulation. Traditional merchandising is not going to entice this group to make purchases. They need stores and online retailers to have captivating signage and be willing to engage them through social media. We aim to attract the attention of this group with our personalized products and by offering an individualized approach to their shopping experience.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We operate in the infant and toddler products industry and we specialize in the personalized baby and toddler products. We face competition from many websites that provide products and services that are similar to ours. We are an enterprise with no competitive position within the personalized baby and toddler products marketplace. We were trying to attract customers to our website by placing advertisements and offering promotions on various baby weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public. We now rely on word of mouth marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website.

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

We maintain over 500 product items in our supply chain and periodically review, add and drop products based upon the demand in the marketplace and product availability.

&#160;

We have never experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining quality merchandise in adequate volumes and at suitable prices.

&#160;

We currently secure our merchandise mostly on a purchase order basis from various wholesale suppliers with whom we have established relationships. We plan to maintain and foster such relationships and to establish and foster new relationships with additional wholesale suppliers. We expect to meet new suppliers through word of mouth introductions, trade shows, and through searches on the Internet.

&#160;

Payments are generally made to suppliers by credit card and, if possible, drop shipped per our request to customers who themselves have provided us their credit card information. In this way, we are trying to limit the amount of inventory we need to carry. In cases where products are drop shipped, our clients cover shipping costs.

&#160;

We currently work with approximately 35 different suppliers. We do not believe that any individual supplier is material to our business, since there are a number of alternative suppliers available to supply products to us.

&#160;

Distribution Methods 

&#160;

We sell directly over the internet though our websites.

&#160;

We may develop relationships with distributors in the U.S. and internationally that will help us increase our domestic and international sales.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We own our domain names, mapletreekids.com, polkadotpatch.com and www.sunshinepolkadots.com. but do not have any trademarks or trade names or any other significant intellectual property.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. We face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.

&#160;

In the US, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.

&#160;

A range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing, linking or hosting third-party content that includes materials that infringe copyrights. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have one officer, our President, Irina Goldman. Ms. Goldman is not compensated for the services she provides to the Company at this time, but may be compensated in the future.
