General 

&#160; 

Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s business consists primarily of accepting deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and investment securities. To a much lesser extent, we also originate home equity loans and lines of credit, construction, commercial and other nonresidential real estate loans, consumer loans, multi-family mortgage loans and other loans. Territorial Savings Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including passbook and statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial and regular checking accounts and Super NOW accounts. Through our subsidiary, Territorial Financial Services, Inc., we engage in insurance agency activities. We also offer various non-deposit investments to our customers, including annuities and mutual funds, through a third-party broker-dealer. 

&#160; 

Market Area 

&#160; 

We conduct business from our corporate offices and from our 28 full-service branch offices located throughout the State of Hawaii. 

&#160; 

The largest sector of Hawaii&#146;s economy is the visitor industry. The Hawaii Tourism Authority reported that 8.6 million visitors came to the state in 2015, a 4.1% increase compared to 2014. The increase in visitor arrivals is primarily due to growth in the number of visitors from the continental United States, Australia and China. Total visitor expenditures in 2015 totaled $15.159 billion, a 2.3% increase compared to 2014. 

&#160; 

The unemployment rate for the State of Hawaii was 3.2% in December 2015, representing a decrease from a 4.0% rate in December 2014. Hawaii&#146;s unemployment rate continued to be lower than the 5.0% rate for the entire United States for December 2015. The growth in the visitor and construction industries have supported the local economy and kept the state&#146;s unemployment rate lower than the national rate. The construction of several new condominium projects and work on the City and County of Honolulu&#146;s mass transit project has increased employment in Hawaii&#146;s construction industry.

&#160; 

The number of sales and the median sale prices of existing single-family homes and condominium units sold increased in 2015 compared to 2014. On the island of Oahu, the primary real estate market in Hawaii, sales of existing single-family homes totaled 3,455 units for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 5.2% compared to sales in 2014. The number of condominium sales, a notable portion of the overall housing market, grew by 4.5% in 2015 compared to 2014. The median price paid on Oahu for a single-family home in December 2015 was $700,000, an increase of 1.4% compared to the median price in December 2014. The median price paid on Oahu for condominiums in December 2015 was $386,250, an increase of 6.9% compared to the median price in December 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On the island of Maui, the second largest real estate market in Hawaii, sales of existing single-family homes totaled 1,090 units in 2015, an increase of 15.7% compared to similar sales during 2014. The number of condominium sales decreased by two units in 2015 compared to 2014. The median price paid for a single-family home on Maui in December 2015 was $580,000, an increase of 1.8% compared to the median price in December 2014. The median price paid on Maui for condominiums in December 2015 was $410,000, a 7.9% increase compared to the median price in December 2014. 

&#160; 

Foreclosure and bankruptcy filings fell in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2015, there were 1,826 mortgage foreclosure cases in Hawaii, a 12.4% decrease from 2014. In 2015, there were 1,569 bankruptcy filings, a decrease of 7.8% compared to the number of filings in 2014. The decrease in foreclosure and bankruptcy filings is primarily due to growth in Hawaii&#146;s economy. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face intense competition in our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and investment banking firms. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. 

&#160; 

Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our banking offices, located in all four counties in the State of Hawaii. As of June 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), we ranked fifth in FDIC-insured deposit market share in the State of Hawaii (out of 13 banks and thrift institutions with offices in Hawaii), with a 3.7% market share. As of that date, our largest market share was in the City and County of Honolulu, where we ranked fifth in deposit market share (out of 13 banks and thrift institutions with offices in the City and County) with a 3.9% market share. 

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

Our primary lending activity is the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate home equity loans and lines of credit, construction, commercial and other nonresidential real estate loans, consumer loans, multi-family mortgage loans and commercial business loans. 

&#160; 

One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans. &#160; At December 31, 2015, $1.146 billion, or 95.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. We offer conforming, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities generally up to 30 years. There has been little demand for adjustable-rate mortgage loans in our market area.

&#160; 

One- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as &#147;conforming loans.&#148; We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is currently $625,500 for single-family homes located in the State of Hawaii. We also originate loans above this amount, which are referred to as &#147;jumbo loans.&#148; These jumbo loan amounts are generally up to $1.0 million, although we do originate loans above this amount. We generally originate fixed-rate jumbo loans with terms of up to 30 years. We have not originated significant amounts of adjustable-rate jumbo loans in recent years due to customer preference for fixed-rate loans in our market area. We generally underwrite jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans. Jumbo loans are not uncommon in our market area. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%, up to and including a loan-to-value ratio of 100%. We generally require private mortgage insurance for loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated $9.8 million of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. We offer a variety of credit programs for low- to moderate-income and first-time home purchasers. These include our first time home purchaser program, where the borrower will receive up to a 50 basis point reduction in points charged in connection with the loan. We also originate first mortgage loans to lower-income individuals who reside in rural census tracts where the U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue a second mortgage and complete the underwriting of the loan, subject to our review before origination. We also offer both FHA and VA fixed-rate loans. 

&#160; 

Other than our loans for the construction of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (described under &#147;&#151;Nonresidential Real Estate Loans&#148;), we currently do not originate new &#147;interest only&#148; mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as &#147;Option ARM&#148; loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer &#147;subprime loans&#148; (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as nonconforming loans having less than full documentation). 

&#160; 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. In addition to traditional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, we offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured primarily by one- to four-family residential homes. Home equity lines of credit have a maximum term of 10 years during which time the borrower is required to make payments to principal based on the amortization of 0.125% of principal outstanding per month. The borrower is permitted to draw against the line during the entire term. Our home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable rates of interest or with fixed rates of interest that convert to adjustable rates of interest after an initial period of up to three years. Our home equity loans are originated with fixed rates of interest and with terms of up to 30 years. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that we use to underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan, while lines of credit for owner-occupied properties and investment properties may be underwritten with loan-to-value ratios of 80% and 65%, respectively, when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We require appraisals on home equity loans and lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of home equity loans totaled $3.0 million, or 0.3% of our total loan portfolio, and the outstanding balance of home equity lines of credit totaled $12.3 million, or 1.0% of our total loan portfolio.

&#160; 

Nonresidential Real Estate Loans. Our nonresidential real estate loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and construction loans for residential real estate projects. These loans totaled $19.3 million, or 1.6% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015. The commercial real estate properties primarily include owner-occupied light industrial properties. We generally seek to originate commercial real estate loans with initial principal balances of $1.0 million or less. Loans secured by

&#160; 

&#160; 

commercial real estate totaled $9.8 million, or 0.8%, of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, and consisted of 12 loans outstanding with an average loan balance of approximately $815,000. All of our nonresidential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2015, our largest commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $3.1 million and was secured by real property and improvements utilized as an office building. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

In the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to the lesser of 75% of the property&#146;s appraised value or purchase price. We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property&#146;s projected net cash flow to the loan&#146;s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 110%), computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate. Personal guarantees are usually obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Almost all of our commercial real estate loans are generated internally by our loan officers. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than for residential properties. 

&#160; 

We also originate a limited amount of construction loans to experienced developers, almost exclusively for the construction of residential real estate projects. Construction loans are also made to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. Construction loans to individuals are generally &#147;interest-only&#148; loans during the construction period, and convert to permanent, amortizing loans following the completion of construction. At December 31, 2015, construction loans totaled $7.2 million, or 0.6% of total loans receivable. At December 31, 2015, the additional unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $3.7 million. 

&#160; 

Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. In the event we make a land acquisition loan on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. We currently do not have any land acquisition development and construction loans. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing. All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines, including those of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, to the extent applicable. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. However, in our market area, customer demand is primarily for fixed-rate loans. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. Most of our one- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations are generated by our branch managers and employees located in our banking offices and our additional commissioned loan officers located in our corporate headquarters. We also advertise throughout our market area. We also receive loans from mortgage brokers, mortgage bankers and other financial institutions that work with our staff to process and close these loans. We underwrite and approve all of these loans.

&#160; 

We sell loans to assist us in managing interest rate risk. We sold $56.2 million, $37.5 million and $82.2 million of residential mortgage loans (all fixed-rate loans, with terms of 10 years or longer) during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had six loans totaling $2.1 million classified as held for sale at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

We sell our loans without recourse, except for normal representations and warranties provided in sales transactions. At December 31, 2015, we were servicing loans owned by others with a principal balance of $51.8 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for our servicing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received servicing fees of $153,000. At December 31, 2015, substantially all of the loans serviced for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were performing in accordance with their contractual terms and we believe that there are no material repurchase obligations associated with these loans. 

&#160; 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan and value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower&#146;s ability to repay, we review the borrower&#146;s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.

&#160; 

Our policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. Aggregate lending relationships in amounts up to $5.0 million can be approved by designated individual officers or officers acting together with specific lending approval authority. Relationships in excess of $5.0 million require the approval of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

Territorial Savings Bank also uses automated systems to underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with balances up to $625,500. We require appraisals of all real property securing one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and on property securing home equity loans and lines of credit. All appraisers are licensed appraisers and all third-party appraisers are approved by the Board of Directors annually. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors has primary responsibility for establishing and overseeing our investment policy. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to implement the investment policy to our Investment Committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Operating Officer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and our Vice President and Controller. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the Investment 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Committee, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the full Board of Directors. The overall objectives of the Investment Policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments to maximize interest income over the long term and to minimize risk, to provide collateral for borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and to reduce our tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and potential returns. Our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer executes our securities portfolio transactions as directed by the Investment Committee. All purchase and sale transactions are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. 

&#160; 

Our current investment policy permits investments in securities issued by the United States Government as well as mortgage-backed securities and direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in certificates of deposit, bank-owned life insurance, collateralized mortgage obligations, trust preferred securities, municipal securities and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank. We purchased stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank in order to obtain services such as demand deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, security safekeeping services and borrowings in the form of advances. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, we are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank. 

&#160; 

Our current policies do not permit hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2015, we held no asset-backed securities other than mortgage-backed securities. As a state savings bank, Territorial Savings Bank is not permitted to invest in equity securities. This general restriction does not apply to Territorial Bancorp Inc. 

&#160; 

The Investments &#151; Debt and Equity Securities topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, based upon our ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. Securities in the available-for-sale and trading classifications are reported at market value and securities in the held-to-maturity classification are reported at amortized cost. A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. If we do not have the intent to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security, impairment occurs when the present value of the remaining cash flows is less than the remaining amortized cost basis. The difference between the present value of remaining cash flows and the remaining amortized cost basis is considered a credit loss. If a credit loss has occurred, impairment is recorded by writing down the value of a security to its fair market value as a charge to earnings. The difference between the write down and the credit loss is considered other comprehensive loss, which is a reduction of stockholders&#146; equity. 

&#160; 

Our held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of securities with the following carrying values: $481.5 million of mortgage-backed securities, $10.7 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and $916,000 of trust preferred securities that were issued by pools of issuers consisting primarily of financial institution holding companies. At December 31, 2015, all of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. At December 31, 2015, there were no securities classified as available-for-sale. At December 31, 2015, none of the collateral underlying our securities portfolio was considered subprime or Alt-A, and we did not hold any common or preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae as of that date. See &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Balance Sheet Analysis&#151;Securities&#148; for a discussion of the recent performance of our securities portfolio. The fair values of our securities are usually based on published or securities dealers&#146; market values. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as &#147;pass-through&#148; certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is &#147;passed through&#148; to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multi-family mortgages. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Ginnie Mae, a United States Government agency, and government sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, either guarantee the payments or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. 

&#160; 

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. We also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and from securities dealers through securities sold under agreements to repurchase to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are loan repayments, maturing investments, retained earnings, income on other earning assets and the proceeds of loan and security sales.

&#160; 

Deposits. &#160; We accept deposits primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, convenient locations and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of passbook and statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, commercial and regular checking accounts and Super NOW accounts. Historically, we have not accepted brokered deposits.

&#160; 

Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies, market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. 

&#160; 

Borrowings. &#160; Our borrowings consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and funds borrowed from securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At December 31, 2015, our Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled $69.0 million, or 4.3% of total liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled $55.0 million, or 3.4% of total liabilities. At December 31, 2015, we had access to additional Federal Home Loan Bank advances of up to $555.1 million. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by our investment in the common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank as well as by a blanket pledge on our assets not otherwise pledged. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured by mortgage-backed securities.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Subsidiary Activities 

&#160; 

Territorial Savings Bank owns 100% of the common stock of Territorial Financial Services, Inc., a Hawaii corporation that engages primarily in insurance activities.

Territorial Savings Bank also owns 100% of the common stock of Territorial Real Estate Co., Inc., an inactive Hawaii corporation that is authorized to manage and dispose of problem real estate. 

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 269 full-time employees and 11 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 

&#160; 

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 

&#160; 

Federal Taxation 

&#160; 

General. &#160; Territorial Bancorp Inc. and Territorial Savings Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Territorial Bancorp Inc. and Territorial Savings Bank.

&#160; 

Method of Accounting . &#160; For federal income tax purposes, Territorial Bancorp Inc. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31st for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.

&#160; 

Minimum Tax. &#160; The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as &#147;alternative minimum taxable income.&#148; The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Territorial Bancorp Inc. had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward.

&#160; 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. &#160; A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Territorial Savings Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes.

&#160; 

Corporate Dividends. &#160; We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Territorial Savings Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.

&#160; 

Audit of Tax Returns. Territorial Bancorp Inc.&#146;s 2011 federal income tax return was audited in 2013. The audit did not result in any material changes to the federal income tax return.

&#160; 

&#160; 

State Taxation 

&#160; 

Territorial Bancorp Inc. and Territorial Savings Bank are subject to a franchise tax imposed under Hawaii law at a rate of 7.92% of net income. The net income to which the tax rate is applied is determined in a manner consistent with the taxable income determined for federal purposes with some adjustments. The principal adjustment to federal taxable income is the inclusion of interest received on municipal bonds in gross income for Hawaii franchise tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Territorial Bancorp Inc.&#146;s state franchise tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period. 

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

On June 25, 2014, Territorial Savings Bank converted from a federal savings bank to a Hawaii state-chartered savings bank. In addition, on July 10, 2014, Territorial Savings Bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a result of these actions, Territorial Savings Bank is examined and supervised by the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions, as its primary state regulator, and by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve Board, as its primary federal regulator. Territorial Savings Bank is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its deposit insurer, under certain circumstances. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#146;s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Under this system of state and federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. The Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board examine Territorial Savings Bank and prepare reports for the consideration of the Bank&#146;s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s loan documents. 

&#160; 

Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Territorial Bancorp Inc., Territorial Savings Bank and their operations. 

&#160; 

Territorial Bancorp Inc. maintained its status as a savings and loan holding company in connection with Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s charter conversion. Accordingly, Territorial Bancorp Inc. is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. Territorial Bancorp Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 

&#160; 

Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to Territorial Savings Bank and Territorial Bancorp Inc. are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Territorial Savings Bank and Territorial Bancorp Inc. and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), signed into law in 2010, eliminated our then-primary federal regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the primary federal regulator for national banks). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assumed the responsibility for examining, regulating and enforcing laws and regulations against federal savings banks effective July 21, 2011. The legislation also established a Financial Services Oversight Council and granted the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System exclusive authority to regulate all bank and thrift holding companies. As a result, Territorial Bancorp Inc. became subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board as opposed to the Office of Thrift Supervision. Compliance with new regulations and being supervised by one or more new regulatory agencies could increase our expenses. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board, to take over the implementation of federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws from the depository institution regulators. However, institutions with $10 billion or fewer in assets, such as Territorial Savings Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with such laws and regulations by the Federal Reserve Board, its primary banking regulator, rather than the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act contained the so-called &#147;Volcker Rule,&#148; which generally prohibits banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge or private equity funds (&#147;covered funds&#148;). On December 13, 2013, the federal agencies issued a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule which, among other things, requires banking organizations to restructure and limit certain of their investments in and relationships with covered funds. The final rule unexpectedly included within the interests subject to its restrictions collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities (&#147;TruPS CDOs&#148;). Many banking organizations, including Territorial Savings Bank, had purchased such instruments because of their favorable tax, accounting and regulatory treatment and would have been subject to unexpected write-downs. In response to concerns expressed by community banking organizations, the federal agencies subsequently issued an interim final rule which grandfathers TruPS CDOs issued before May 19, 2010 if (i) acquired by a banking organization on or before December 10, 2013 and (ii) the organization reasonably believed the proceeds from the TruPS CDOs were invested primarily in any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued by a depository institution holding company with less than $15 billion in assets or by a mutual holding company. Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s investment in TruPS CDOs is grandfathered by these new provisions and is further discussed in this 10-K report. 

&#160; 

Federal Banking Regulation 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. &#160; Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The current capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BASEL III) and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160; 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#146; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred 

&#160; 

&#160; 

stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution&#146;s capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve Bank takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 

&#160; 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s regulatory capital was considered to be well capitalized under the revised capital requirements, which became effective on January 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations . &#160; Under prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized member banks. The extent of supervisory action depends upon the degree of the institution&#146;s undercapitalization. For this purpose, a member bank is placed in one of the following five categories based on the bank&#146;s capital:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital);

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital); and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, Territorial Savings Bank met the criteria for being considered &#147;well-capitalized.&#148; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Capital Distributions. &#160; Federal Reserve member banks must receive the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to pay dividends: (i) in an amount that exceeds the sum of the bank&#146;s net income during the calendar year and retained net income of the prior two calendar years or (ii) that would exceed the bank&#146;s undivided profits. Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the Board of Directors declares a dividend.

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove a notice or application if: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the proposed dividend raises safety and soundness concerns; or

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the dividend would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation with a federal banking regulatory agency or any formal or informal enforcement action.

&#160; 

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. &#160; All savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a state member bank, the Federal Reserve Board is required to assess the savings bank&#146;s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A savings bank&#146;s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Community Reinvestment Act requires all Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured institutions to publicly disclose their rating. Territorial Savings Bank received a &#147;satisfactory&#148; Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.

&#160; 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. &#160; Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit insurance per account owner is $250,000.

&#160; 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#146;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution&#146;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that changed the assessment range to 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. That payment is established quarterly and during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, equaled 0.60 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%. 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#160; Territorial Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, Territorial Savings Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2015, Territorial Savings Bank held $4.8 million of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and was in compliance with this requirement.

&#160; 

Hawaii Banking Regulation 

&#160; 

Authority granted by Hawaii laws includes accepting and holding deposits, borrowing from any source, making loans and extensions of credit of any kind, investing in service corporation subsidiaries engaged in activities permissible for service corporations of federal savings banks and engaging in other activities that are usual or incidental to the business of a savings bank. Hawaii law requires that at least 50% of a savings bank&#146;s loans and extensions of credit be secured by real estate. In addition, certain commercial loans are limited to 15% of the savings bank&#146;s assets and education loans are limited to 10% of assets. 

&#160; 

Hawaii law generally limits a savings bank&#146;s capital distributions to the amount of its retained earnings. 

&#160; 

Hawaii has a parity statute, which provides Hawaii savings banks with authority to engage in any activity permitted by federal law for federal savings banks, upon receiving the approval of the Commissioner. Territorial Savings Bank received such approval when it converted from a federal savings bank to a Hawaii savings bank. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Territorial Savings Bank&#146;s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one- to four-family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; fair lending laws;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (&#147;UDAP&#148;) laws and regulations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Truth in Savings Act; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.

&#160; 

The operations of Territorial Savings Bank are further subject to the: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#146; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act (also known as &#147;Check 21&#148;), which gives &#147;substitute checks,&#148; such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings banks to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution&#146;s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148; of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

General . Territorial Bancorp Inc. is a nondiversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners&#146; Loan Act. As such, Territorial Bancorp Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Territorial Bancorp Inc. and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. The Dodd-Frank Act regulatory restructuring transferred the responsibility for regulating and supervising savings and loan holding companies from the Office of Thrift Supervision to the Federal Reserve Board, effective July 21, 2011.

&#160; 

Permissible Activities. The business activities of Territorial Bancorp Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. The Dodd-Frank Act added that any savings and loan holding company that engages in activities permissible for a financial holding company must meet the qualitative requirements for a bank holding company to be a financial holding company and conduct the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply to a financial holding company&#146;s conduct of the activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.

&#160; 

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Territorial Bancorp Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a nonsubsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 

&#160; 

(i) &#160; the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and

&#160; 

(ii) &#160; the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities are no longer includable as Tier 1 capital, as was previously the case with bank holding companies, subject to certain grandfathering. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements this Dodd-Frank Act requirement as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer for savings and loan holding companies will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.

&#160; 

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the &#147;source of strength&#148; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

&#160; 

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. &#160; The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#146;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company&#146;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend. The guidance also provides for prior regulatory review where the company&#146;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#146;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory review prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding as of the end of a quarter compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Territorial Bancorp Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

&#160; 

Change in Control Regulations 

&#160; 

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days&#146; prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company&#146;s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company&#146;s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Territorial Bancorp Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Federal Securities Laws 

&#160; 

Territorial Bancorp Inc.&#146;s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Territorial Bancorp Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

&#160; 

Territorial Bancorp Inc. common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal shareholders) of Territorial Bancorp Inc. may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If Territorial Bancorp Inc. meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Territorial Bancorp Inc. is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. 

&#160;
