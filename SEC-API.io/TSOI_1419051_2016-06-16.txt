Description of Business until April 28, 2014 

Until April 28, 2014 the Company sold (directly and through distributors and sublicensees), in non-US countries, plastic intraoral devices known as Anterior Midpoint Stop Appliances (&#147;AMPSA Products&#148;) . Our customers were dentists and doctors. The AMPSA Products, which are used for the treatment and prevention of common neurological and temporomandibular disorders including migraine headaches, migraine pain and bruxism. 

On April 28, 2014, we received a letter from Mr. J. Christopher Jaczko, a lawyer with the Procopio law firm in San Diego who represents Boyd Research, Inc. and related parties. In his letter, Mr. Jaczko notified us that our license to use the international patents for our AMPSA device, pursuant to our license agreement with his clients effective January 1, 2013, was terminated. The ostensible reason Mr. Jaczko gave was our failure to make certain unspecified payments due under the license agreement to his clients. We disputed the termination, but believed that the costs involved with litigating the termination of the New License was not in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Company decided to move in new direction. 

CURRENT BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 

Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (&#147;TSI&#148;), is a public company (OTC:TSOI) focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one&#146;s immune system.

Activating one&#146;s immune system is now a well-accepted method to cure certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. On the other hand, inhibiting one&#146;s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and allergic reactions.

TSI is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, improve maternal and fetal health, fight periodontal disease, and for daily health. TSI has created several subsidiaries and divisions to focus on each of these programs:

Nutraceutical Division &#150; TSI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its flagship product, ProJuvenol &#174; , is a proprietary mixture containing pterostilbene &#150; one of the most potent antioxidants known. TSOI filed a patent application for ProJuvenol &#174; on 07-08-2015 titled: &#147;Augmentation of Oncology Immunotherapies by Pterostilbene Containing Compositions&#148;.

OmniBiome, Inc. - is a subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2015, where the intellectual property surrounding probiotics is housed. Current programs focus on the use of probiotics to prevent pre-term labor and on using probiotics to reverse periodontal disease.

MolecuVax, Inc. &#150; is a subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 28, 2015, where the intellectual property surrounding immune-oncology is housed. The programs within MolecuVax include using exosomes derived from various immune cells to attack cancers as well as developing a cancer vaccine against cancers that express a certain protein unique to them.

Summary 

TSI has assembled a first-rate scientific advisory board that is leading the company into the most exciting and potentially profitable fields of medicine &#150; immune modulation. TSI expects to launch several products that improve people&#146;s health and well-being over the next several months.

Principle Products and Services 

Clinical Stage Dexosome 

TSOI recently licensed in 2016 a Dexosome Clinical Stage Cancer Immunotherapy Product from Gustave Roussy European Cancer Centre. Planning is still underway as to next steps.

Dexosomes are exosome nanoparticles generated by dendritic cells, which have previously been used by investigators at Anosys, Inc., in collaboration with researchers at Duke University, for treatment of cancer patients as part of an FDA-cleared Phase I clinical trial 1 . The licensed patent was invented by internationally-renowned immunologists Sebastian Amigorena, Doctor at the Curie Institute, and Laurence Zitvogel, Professor at Gustave Roussy. The patent covers means of generating therapeutically-effective dexosomes, which can act as a platform for loading any tumor antigen desired. 

In the area of drug development, much of the risk is taking the technology from the lab to the patient. We are fortunate that the current technology has already been utilized in patients under FDA jurisdiction, and has demonstrated safety with signs of efficacy.

The in-licensing of the current patent augments previously filed patent applications by TSOI, including one filed in November 2015, covering uses of exosomes to stimulate both innate and adaptive arms of the immune response 2 . The Company plans to leverage the experience of its newest Board Member, Dr. Thomas Ichim, to lead the Dexosome program back into clinical trials. Dr. Ichim has previously patented the manipulation of exosomes in the area of cancer therapy for alleviation of immune suppression 3 , as well as being published in the peer-reviewed literature in this area 4 , 5 .

Nutraceutical Division (TSOI) 

ProJuvenol &#174; is a powerful synergistic blend of complex anti-aging ingredients inspired by nature to help promote cellular rejuvenation and healthy functionality for everyday living, based upon pterostilbene, one of nature's unique and intelligent antioxidants/anti-inflammatories. ProJuvenol includes a scientifically valid blend of interactive ingredients with anti-aging and cellular protective properties to help support optimal health and provide the benefits of mental alertness and physical well-being.

Pterostilbene (pronounced &#34;tero-STILL-bean&#34;) has created a buzz in the world of nutrition research. Scientists discovered this powerful antioxidant several decades ago and have since found that it rivals its cousin resveratrol's multi-functional abilities, and may actually exceed its anti-aging and health promoting potential. Found naturally in blueberries, pterostilbene has been shown in emerging experimental studies to exhibit up to 7 times greater bioavailability than resveratrol as well as better metabolic stability. This translates to potentially higher levels of pterostilbene in the blood upon ingestion, and longer lasting effects in the body compared to resveratrol. More simply put, it remains active in your body for a much greater period of time and during this enhanced bio-available period your body has the opportunity to allow it to utilize this powerful antioxidant molecule.

A large body of experimental research has now documented a wide range of potential health effects associated with pterostilbene. In fact, the more researchers study pterostilbene, the greater its human health potential becomes. In addition to being a powerful antioxidant, emerging experimental research suggests this plant compound may also help regulate cell growth, promote fat metabolism, support glucose utilization, influence brain function, and improve the body's natural detoxification enzymes that are required to help protect cells against potentially damaging compounds from the environment.

ProJuvenol &#169; includes: 

Pterostilbene (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene) is a natural dietary compound and the primary antioxidant component of blueberries. It has increased bioavailability in comparison to other stilbene compounds, which may enhance its dietary benefit and possibly contribute to a valuable clinical effect. Multiple studies have demonstrated the antioxidant activity of pterostilbene in both in vitro and in vivo models illustrating both preventative and therapeutic benefits. The antioxidant activity of pterostilbene has been implicated in anticarcinogenesis, modulation of neurological disease, anti-inflammation, attenuation of vascular disease, and amelioration of diabetes.

Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) , a coenzyme that is essential for producing cellular energy, assists in deactivating cell-damaging free radicals and renewing the body's antioxidant defense system. ALA supports a healthy liver function and enhanced insulin sensitivities.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) , an essential enzyme found in all living cells, it is a powerful cellular protector which helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells, assisting in the prevention of damage to tissues. Green coffee bean extract, which contains antioxidant polyphenols and plant compounds that help support a variety of biological processes including fat and glucose metabolism. Projuvenol uses the only known, patented coated source of Superoxide dismutase, to ensure that your body has the ability to absorb and utilize this ingredient. Uncoated versions of SOD have not been shown to be effective when taken orally.

DMAE, 2-dimethylaminoethanol , an ingredient known to help promote choline production, which is required for healthy neurological and cognitive function. DMAE has been shown to have the ability to scavenge specific types of free radicals, it is also has been shown to assist in improving memory and mood; boosting thinking skills and intelligence; and increasing physical energy, oxygen efficiency, athletic performance, and muscle reflexes. 

Piperine for bio-enhanced nutrient absorption. Piperine has been clinically tested in the United States. Piperine significantly enhances the bioavailability of various supplement nutrients through increased absorption. We have included this in ProJuvenol because we believe that it significantly increases the absorption of the amazing active ingredients found in ProJuvenol.

Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory molecule in the turmeric root, a relative of ginger.

Patents: 

TSOI filed a patent covering the use of its ProJuvenol &#174; product, as well as various pterostilbene compositions, for use in augmenting efficacy of existing immuno-oncology drugs that are currently on the market. The patent is based on the ability of pterostilbene, one of the major ingredients of ProJuvenol &#174; , to reduce oxidative stress produced by cancer cells, which in turn protects the immune system from cancer mediated immune suppression.

Immuno-Oncology, described by Science Magazine as 'Breakthrough of the Year 1 ' offers the possibility of not only killing tumor cells in a non-toxic manner, but also establishing immunological memory, which patrols the body and destroys recurrent tumor cells. While great progress has been made in developing drugs that stimulate the immune system to recognize and kill tumors, a major pitfall of current approaches is that tumors produce chemicals and oxidative stress that suppresses the immune system, thus limiting efficacy of immune therapies.

Pterostilbene, which is chemically related to resveratrol, has been published to possess anticancer 2 , 3 , antioxidant 4 , and anti-inflammatory activities 5 . Through the filing of the recent patent, the company is exploring whether its lead product, ProJuvenol&#174;, may be useful as a nutraceutical adjuvant to conventional cancer immunotherapies. 

The importance of proper nutrition in the context of immunotherapy cannot be overstated. Studies on one of the original cancer immunotherapies, interleukin-2, demonstrated that efficacy was related to anti-oxidant content in the patients at time of therapy 6 . Accordingly, we are seeking through the current work to identify whether our currently marketed product, ProJuvenol&#174;, may be utilized as part of an integrative approach to building up the immune response of cancer patients.

In addition on April 28, 2016 the Company filed a patent application covering the use of ProJuvenol &#169; and its active ingredient pterostilbene for augmentation of stem cell activity. Diseases such as diabetes 1 , cardiovascular disease 2 , and neurodegenerative diseases 3 are characterized by deficient stem cell activity. The patent covers the stimulation of stem cells that already exist in the patient&#146;s body, as well as stem cells that are administered therapeutically.

Studies have shown that patients who have higher levels of endogenous stem cell activity have reduced cardiovascular disease risk 4 and undergo accelerated neurological recovery after stroke 5 as compared to patients with lower numbers of such stem cells.

TSOI markets currently two other nutraceuticals, T-Rx &#174; , a testosterone booster, and Vital &#174; Female, an estrogen booster and has plans to introduce a line of &#147;oncologist friendly nutraceuticals&#148; in liposome formula.

ProJuvenol &#174; - Is a powerful synergistic blend of complex anti-aging ingredients inspired by nature to help promote cellular rejuvenation and healthy functionality for everyday living. Based upon one of nature's unique and intelligent anti- oxidants/anti-inflammatories.

T-Rx &#174; - Is specifically designed just for men and is formulated to assist in increasing testosterone levels and keeping them high. The result is a significant increase in testosterone levels, which assist in adding lean muscle mass, bone density, increased energy and the reduction of fat.

VITAL &#174; - Is specifically formulated for women and is designed to increase energy, increase bone density, reduce fat and improve muscle tone. Additionally this supplement will also optimize hormone levels, increase libido, and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety.

Fetal-Maternal Health 

OmniBiome, Inc. 

OmniBiome, Inc. is focused on therapeutic / Rx approaches to either utilize or intervene with the systemic effects of the vaginal, lactal-duct and oral microbiomes for improving maternal healthcare and resulting birth outcomes.

The Company will focus initially on developing CLIA Dx services for both pre-pregnancy-associated and pregnancy-associated conditions or diseases where there is a substantive link with microbiome dysbiosis (disruption or imbalance), as well as on restoring eubiosis (proper balance).

In parallel OmniBiome will build a database of aggregated patient data that will later inform development of Rx / therapeutic and medical device &#38; drug-device combination approaches for treating the same conditions or diseases.

MicroBiome Targets 

Certain microbiome target markets offer immediate revenue-generating business opportunities such as vaginal and lactal-duct microbiome banking &#38; transplants from mother to child in the case of C-section-born babies, babies of non-nursing mothers, and children under 5 years of age receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics

OmniBiome&#146;s main focus will be on developing Dx / Rx products &#38; services for pregnancy-associated conditions or diseases where there is a documented or substantive putative link with microbiome dysbiosis and resulting inflammatory cascades

In parallel the Company will look to create alliances and/or out-license its Medical Device / Drug Device Combinations patent portfolio.

The Company also plans to in-license microbiome - and pregnancy-related Rx &#38; Dx innovations from universities and research institutes &#150; with several having been identified.

The Human Microbiome Link 

The following microbiomes combined recapitulate approximately 75 - 80 % of the gut microbiome, hence OmniBiome sees no need to focus on the gut microbiome

The Vaginal Microbiome comprises approximately 300 - 600 species of bacteria. 100s of species are transferred to the newborn child orally as the baby passes thru the birth canal. C-section-born children miss this important microbiome transfer

The Breast Milk Microbiome contains between 200 - 700 species of bacteria and is transferred to the child via nursing. Babies of non-nursing mothers miss this equally important transfer.

The Oral Microbiome diversity spectrum also covers 600 species shared with the baby via kissing and sharing eating utensils &#150; with both the mother &#38; the father.

Immune-Oncology 

MolecuVax, Inc. 

MolecuVax is a subsidiary of the Company where the intellectual property surrounding immune-oncology is housed. The programs within MolecuVax include using exosomes derived from various immune cells to attack cancers as well as developing a cancer vaccine against cancers that express a certain protein unique to them.

On February 08, 2016 TSOI licensed its exosome patent filed on 11-20-2015 to MolecuVax titled &#147;Exosome Mediated Innate and Adaptive Immune Stimulation for Treatment of Cancer&#148; as part of a future generation of immune cell derived nanoparticles, as a means of selectively stimulating the body's own natural defense mechanisms to seek and destroy cancer cells by company collaborators. The patent is focused on a means of manufacturing exosomes that possess high concentrations of proteins found on tumors, which are specifically optimized to stimulate the immune system of cancer patients as a new form of immunotherapy. 

This patent was collaboration between Dr. Michael Agadjanyan, Head of the Department of Immunology at the Institute for Molecular Medicine, and Dr. Santosh Kesari, Head of Neuro-Oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Center, both of whom are members of the Scientific Advisory Board of TSOI. 

Exosomes are one of the means by which immune system cells communicate with each other. In the current patent we disclose means of generating exosomes in the laboratory, which can be utilized as a nanoparticle-based cancer vaccine to stimulate immune response to tumors in patients suffering from cancer.

Immunotherapy of cancer offers the possibility of selectively treating cancer without the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The recent FDA approval of immune stimulatory drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors strongly supports the advancement of this natural means of using the body's own immune system to treat the cancer. Immunotherapy offers possibility to help patients in which chemotherapy and radiotherapy no longer work, without the side effects of these approaches. 

On April 11, 2016 the Company announced the signing of an agreement between its subsidiary, MolecuVax, Inc., (MVAX) and the Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center covering production and clinical implementation of a novel cancer immunotherapy based around MVAX&#146;s proprietary BORISome&#153; (Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS)) peptide/exosome technology.

In November of last year, the Company filed a patent on technologies covering novel means of stimulating the immune system to kill cancer using naturally made nanoparticles termed &#147;exosomes&#148; 1 , which was subsequently licensed to MVAX 2 . In contrast to previous exosome-based cancer therapeutic approaches, the strategy being pursued by MVAX involves focusing the immune system to attack the protein BORIS, which is selectively found on cancer stem cells 3 .

BORIS represents a unique target in the fight against cancer because it is only found on cancer cells and not healthy tissues. Additionally, because it is selectively found on cancer stem cells, we possess the possibility of inducing an immune response that would strike cancer at its roots, which are the cancer stem cells. By leveraging dendritic cell technology to generate BORIS-expressing exosomes in vivo, we believe the current therapeutic approach possesses a possibility of inducing a potent and selective immune response against cancer.

The Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center is a clinical research and treatment facility, which has been offering dendritic cell therapy for treatment of cancer patients. The current collaboration will leverage existing cellular therapy manufacturing expertise to develop, and clinically apply, the BORIS-peptide loaded dendritic cell therapy to patients.

Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Board Member of TSOI co-authored three of the scientific peer reviewed papers demonstrating efficacy of BORIS-targeting immunotherapy in animal models, some of the papers together with scientists from the National Institutes of Health 4 , 5 , 6 .

The importance of BORIS is difficult to overstate, not only is it a marker that is found on cancer stem cells, but when the protein is blocked from expressing by using gene silencing, we have previously published that cancer cells die 7 . Accordingly, there is a possibility that it will be difficult for tumors to become resistant to BORIS-based immunotherapies.

On May 09, 2016 the Company announced the signing of an exclusive license agreement between its subsidiary, MolecuVax, Inc., (MVAX) and UniVax, LLC covering composition of matter of a new cancer vaccine that targets a molecule found in cancer stem cells of a variety of types of cancers. The vaccine target, termed CTCFL or Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS), was discovered by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 1 , and has been shown in numerous peer-reviewed studies to be essential for cancer survival and progression 2 , 3 , 4 .

The patent covers vaccines that stimulate the immune system to selectively kill tumor cells that are expressing this universal &#147;cancer specific&#148; protein. In contrast to other vaccines, our vaccine is targeting BORIS protein that is critical for the growth of histologically different cancers. This possesses important implications in that if a cancer cell mutates to lose expression of the target, then the cancer cell will no longer be cancerous.

The technology licensed positions MolecuVax in an ideal situation given the rapidly expanding interest in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. The great successes of CAR-T cells and checkpoint inhibitors have already saved many lives and are testimony to the efficacy of this approach to cancer. We aim to utilize the licensed technology to enter clinical trials, in part through our existing collaboration with the Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center 5 , as well as our planned FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) submission.

This vaccine was developed at the Institute for Molecular Medicine in Huntington Beach, California by Michael Agadjanyan, Ph.D. D.Sc., Head of the Cancer Vaccines Laboratory and member of TSI&#146;s Scientific Advisory Board, and Anahit Ghochikyan, Ph.D., Head of the Alzheimer&#146;s Disease Vaccines Laboratory. The vaccine is important because it not only prevents onset of cancer, but can also be used in patients that have cancer, thus it is termed a &#147;therapeutic vaccine&#148;. Additionally, the vaccine can be used as part of dendritic cell immunotherapy, which the inventors previously published as being &#147;extremely effective&#148; against breast cancer in animal models 6 .

Our collaborators have been working on the concept of selectively killing cancer by immunologically targeting BORIS / CTCFL for over a decade. This work is now translated from a scientific hypothesis, to issued US and International patents, and now on the road to commercialization and to patients. Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Board Member of TSOI has co-authored publications on BORIS / CTCFL with Dr. Agadjanyan and researchers at the NIH on this technology 7 , 8 , 9 .

The Company&#146;s business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the United States, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Company will be subject to additional agencies and regulations if it enters the manufacturing business. Various agencies of the state and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others: 

&#183;

product claims and advertising; 

&#183;

product labels; 

&#183;

product ingredients; and 

&#183;

how we package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products.

The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the United States, while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. The FDA issued a final rule called &#147;Statements Made for Dietary Supplements Concerning the Effect of the Product on the Structure or Function of the Body,&#148; which includes regulations requiring companies, their suppliers and manufacturers to meet Good Manufacturing Practices in the preparation, packaging, storage and shipment of their products. Management is committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA.

The FDA has also issued regulations governing the labeling and marketing of dietary and nutritional supplement products. They include: 

&#183;

the identification of dietary or nutritional supplements and their nutrition and ingredient labeling; 

&#183;

requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support; 

&#183;

labeling requirements for dietary or nutritional supplements for which &#147;high potency&#148; and &#147;antioxidant&#148; claims are made;

&#183;

notification procedures for statements on dietary and nutritional supplements; and 

&#183;

pre-market notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.

&#160;

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) revised the existing provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status. 

The Company is also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and intellectual property.
