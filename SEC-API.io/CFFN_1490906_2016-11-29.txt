 Item 1. Business 

General 

The Company is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in April 2010. The Company's common stock is traded on the Global Select tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "CFFN." 

The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is a federally chartered and insured savings bank headquartered in Topeka, Kansas. The Bank is examined and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC"), its primary regulator, and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF"), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). We primarily serve the metropolitan areas of Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence, Manhattan, Emporia and Salina, Kansas and a portion of the metropolitan area of greater Kansas City through 37 traditional and 10 in-store branches. The Company, as a savings and loan holding company, is examined and regulated by the FRB. 

We have been, and intend to continue to be, a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. We attract retail deposits from the general public and invest those funds primarily in permanent loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences. We also originate consumer loans primarily secured by mortgages on one- to four-family residences, originate and participate in loans with other lenders that are secured by commercial real estate, &#32; and invest in certain investment securities and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") using funding from retail deposits, brokered and public unit deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank Topeka ("FHLB") borrowings, and repurchase agreements. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include savings accounts, money market accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, and certificates of deposit with terms ranging from 91 days to 96 months. Our revenues are derived principally from interest on loans, MBS, investment securities, and FHLB stock. 

The Company is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions, including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulation of financial institutions. Retail deposit balances are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing investment products, the level of personal income, and the personal rate of savings within our market areas. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for housing and other loans, our loan underwriting guidelines compared to those of our competitors, as well as interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions. 

Our executive offices are located at 700 South Kansas Avenue, Topeka, Kansas 66603, and our telephone number at that address is (785) 235-1341.

Market Area and Competition 

Our corporate office is located in Topeka, Kansas. We currently have a network of 47 branches (37 traditional branches and 10 in-store branches) located in nine counties throughout Kansas and three counties in Missouri. We primarily serve the metropolitan areas of Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence, Manhattan, Emporia, and Salina, Kansas and a portion of the metropolitan area of greater Kansas City. In addition to providing full service banking offices, we provide our customers mobile banking, telephone banking and bill payment services, and online banking and bill payment services. We also have a call center which operates on extended hours. 

The Bank ranked third in deposit market share, at 6.23%, in the state of Kansas as reported in the June 30, 2016 FDIC "Summary of Deposits - Market Share Report." The first and second ranked institutions had a 15.06% and a 7.00% deposit market share, respectively. The institution with 15.06% of deposit market share is primarily an Internet-based institution with only one physical location in Kansas. Deposit market share is measured by total deposits, without consideration for type of deposit. We do not offer commercial deposit accounts, while many of our competitors have both commercial and retail deposits in their total deposit base. Some of our competitors also offer products and services that we do not, such as trust services and private banking, which may add to their total deposits. Consumers also have the ability to utilize online financial institutions and investment brokerages that are not confined to any specific market area. Management considers our well-established retail banking network together with our reputation for financial strength and customer service to be major factors in our success at attracting and retaining customers in our market areas. 

The Bank consistently has been one of the top one- to four-family lenders with regard to mortgage loan origination volume in the state of Kansas. Through our strong relationships with real estate agents and marketing efforts, which reflect our reputation and pricing, we attract mortgage loan business from walk-in customers, customers that apply online, and existing customers. Competition in originating one- to four-family loans primarily comes from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, and mortgage bankers. Other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. 

&#160; 

Lending Practices and Underwriting Standards 

General. &#32;&#32;Originating and purchasing loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties is the Bank's primary lending business, resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans located in Kansas and Missouri. The Bank also originates consumer loans and construction loans secured by residential properties, and originates and participates in commercial real estate loans. 

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The Bank originates and services one- to four-family loans that are not guaranteed or insured by the federal government, and purchases one- to four-family loans, on a loan-by-loan basis, from a select group of correspondent lenders. 

Originated Loans 

While the Bank originates both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans, our origination volume is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market areas. Demand is affected by the local housing market, competition, and the interest rate environment. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the Bank originated and refinanced $663.3 million and $697.1 million of one- to four-family loans, respectively. 

Correspondent Purchased Loans 

The Bank purchases one- to four-family loans, on a loan-by-loan basis, from a select group of correspondent lenders. Loan purchases enable the Bank to attain geographic diversification in the loan portfolio. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had correspondent lending relationships in 28 states and the District of Columbia. &#32;&#32; During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the Bank purchased $662.8 million and $651.0 million, respectively, of one- to four-family loans from correspondent lenders. We generally pay a premium of 0.50% to 1.0% of the loan balance to purchase these loans, and we pay 1.0% of the loan balance to purchase the servicing of these loans. 

The Bank has an agreement with a third-party mortgage sub-servicer to provide loan servicing for loans originated by the Bank's correspondent lenders in certain states. The sub-servicer has experience servicing loans in the market areas in which the Bank purchases loans and services the loans according to the Bank's servicing standards, which is intended to allow the Bank greater control over servicing and reporting and help maintain a standard of loan performance. 

Bulk Purchased Loans 

The Bank has also purchased one- to four-family loans from correspondent and nationwide lenders in bulk loan packages. The last bulk loan package purchased by the Bank was in August 2012. The Bank no longer purchases bulk loan packages. See "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information regarding why the Bank no longer purchases bulk loan packages. 

At September 30, 2016, $239.1 million, or 57% of the Bank's bulk purchased loan portfolio, are loans guaranteed by the seller. The Bank believes the seller has the financial ability to repurchase or replace loans if any loans were to become delinquent. The Bank has not experienced any losses with this group of loans since the loan package was purchased in August 2012. 

The servicing rights associated with bulk purchased loans were generally retained by the lender/seller for the loans purchased from nationwide lenders. The servicing with nationwide lenders is governed by a servicing agreement, which outlines collection policies and procedures, as well as oversight requirements, such as servicer certifications attesting to and providing proof of compliance with the servicing agreement. 

Underwriting 

Full documentation to support an applicant's credit and income, and sufficient funds to cover all applicable fees and reserves at closing, are required on all loans. Generally, loans are underwritten according to the "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards, as issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), with total debt-to-income ratios not exceeding 43% of a borrower's verified income. Information pertaining to the creditworthiness of the borrower generally consists of a summary of the borrower's credit history, employment stability, sources of income, assets, net worth, and debt ratios. The value of the subject property must be supported by an appraisal report prepared in accordance with our appraisal policy by either a staff appraiser or a fee appraiser, both of which are independent of the loan origination function and who are approved by our Board of Directors. 

Loans over $500 thousand must be underwritten by two senior underwriters. Loans over $750 thousand must be approved by our Asset and Liability Management Committee ("ALCO"), while loans over $1.5 million must be approved by our Board of Directors. For loans requiring ALCO and/or Board of Directors' approval, lending management is responsible for presenting to ALCO and/or the Board of Directors information about the creditworthiness of the borrower and the market value of the subject property. 

The underwriting standards for loans purchased from correspondent and nationwide lenders are generally similar to the Bank's internal underwriting standards. The underwriting of correspondent loans is performed by the Bank's underwriters. Our standard contractual agreement with the lender/seller includes recourse options for any breach of representation or warranty with respect to the loans purchased. The Bank did not request any lenders/sellers to repurchase loans for breach of representation during fiscal year 2016. 

Adjustable-rate Mortgage ("ARM") Loans 

ARM loans are offered with a three-year, five-year, or seven-year term to the initial repricing date. After the initial period, the interest rate for each ARM loan adjusts annually for the remainder of the term of the loan. Currently, the repricing index for loan originations and correspondent purchases is tied to London Interbank Offered Rates ("LIBOR"); however, other indices have been used in the past. Current adjustable-rate one- to four-family loans originated by the Bank generally provide for a specified rate limit or cap on the periodic adjustment to the interest rate, as well as a specified maximum lifetime cap and minimum rate, or floor. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Negative amortization of principal is not allowed. For three- and five-year ARM loans, borrowers are qualified based on the principal, interest, tax, and insurance payments at the initial interest rate plus the life of loan cap and the initial interest rate plus the first period cap, respectively. For seven-year ARM loans, borrowers are qualified based on the principal, interest, tax, and insurance payments at the initial rate. After the initial three-, five-, or seven-year period, the interest rate resets annually and the new principal and interest payment is based on the new interest rate, remaining unpaid principal balance, and term of the ARM loan. Our ARM loans are not automatically convertible into fixed-rate loans; however, we do allow borrowers to pay an endorsement fee to convert an ARM loan to a fixed-rate loan. ARM loans can pose greater credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower's payment also rises, increasing the potential for default. This specific type of risk is known as repricing risk. 

Pricing 

Our pricing strategy for one- to four-family loan products includes setting interest rates based on secondary market prices and local competitor pricing for our local lending markets, and secondary market prices and national competitor pricing for our correspondent markets. 

Mortgage Insurance 

For a mortgage with a loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio in excess of 80% at the time of origination, private mortgage insurance ("PMI") is required in order to reduce the Bank's loss exposure. The Bank will lend up to 97% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family loans, &#32; provided PMI is obtained. &#32;&#32; Management continuously monitors the claim-paying ability of our PMI counterparties. We believe our PMI counterparties have the ability to meet potential claim obligations we may file in the foreseeable future. 

Repayment 

The Bank's one- to four-family loans are primarily fully amortizing fixed-rate or ARM loans. The contractual maturities for fixed-rate loans and ARM loans can be up to 30 years; however, there are certain bulk purchased ARM loans that had original contractual maturities of 40 years. Our one- to four-family loans are generally not assumable and do not contain prepayment penalties. A "due on sale" clause, allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the secured property, is generally included in the security instrument. 

Construction Lending 

The Bank originates and purchases, from correspondent lenders, construction-to-permanent loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. At September 30, 2016, we had $39.4 million in construction-to-permanent one- to four-family loans outstanding representing approximately 1% of our total loan portfolio. 

The majority of the one- to four-family construction loans are secured by property located within the Bank's Kansas City market area. Construction loans are obtained by homeowners who will occupy the property when construction is complete. Construction loans to builders for speculative purposes are not permitted. The application process includes submission of complete plans, specifications, and costs of the project to be constructed. All construction loans are manually underwritten using the Bank's internal underwriting standards. The Bank's one- to four-family construction-to-permanent loan program combines the construction loan and the permanent loan into one loan allowing the borrower to secure the same interest rate throughout the construction period and the permanent loan. 

Construction draw requests and the supporting documentation are reviewed and approved by authorized management or experienced construction loan personnel. The Bank also performs regular documented inspections of the construction project to ensure the funds are being used for the intended purpose and the project is being completed according to the plans and specifications provided. The Bank charges a 1% fee at closing, based on the loan amount, for these administrative requirements. Interest is not capitalized during the construction period; it is billed and collected monthly based on the amount of funds disbursed. Once the construction period is complete, the payment method is changed from interest-only to an amortized principal and interest payment for the remaining term of the loan. 

Loan Endorsement Program 

In an effort to offset the impact of repayments and to retain our customers, existing loan customers, including customers whose loans were purchased from a correspondent lender, have the opportunity, for a cash fee, to endorse their original loan terms to current loan terms being offered. Customers whose loans have been sold to third parties, or have been delinquent on their contractual loan payments during the previous 12 months, or are currently in bankruptcy, are not eligible to participate in this program. The Bank does not solicit customers for this program, but considers it a valuable opportunity to retain customers who, based on our initial underwriting criteria, could likely obtain similar financing elsewhere. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, the Bank endorsed $160.0 million and $121.6 million of one- to four-family loans, respectively. 

Loan Sales 

One- to four-family loans may be sold on a bulk basis for portfolio restructuring or on a flow basis as loans are originated to reduce interest rate risk and/or maintain a certain liquidity position. Loans originated by the Bank and purchased from correspondent lenders are generally eligible for sale in the secondary market. The Bank generally retains the servicing on these loans. ALCO determines the criteria upon which one- to four-family loans are to be classified as held-for-sale or held-for-investment. One- to four-family loans classified as held-for-sale are to be sold in accordance with policies set forth by ALCO. One- to four-family loans classified as held-for-investment are generally not sold unless a specific segment of the portfolio is identified for asset restructuring purposes. The Bank did not sell any one- to four-family loans during fiscal years 2016 or 2015. 

Consumer Lending. &#32;&#32;The Bank offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, auto loans, and loans secured by savings deposits. The Bank also originates a very limited amount of unsecured loans. The Bank does not originate any consumer loans on an indirect basis, such as contracts purchased from retailers of goods or services which have extended credit to their customers. &#32; All consumer loans are originated in the Bank's market areas. At September 30, 2016, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $127.6 million, or approximately 2% of our total loan portfolio. 

The majority of our consumer loan portfolio is comprised of home equity lines of credit which have interest rates that can adjust monthly based upon changes in the Prime rate, up to a maximum of 18%. For a majority of the home equity lines of credit, the Bank has the first mortgage or the Bank is in the first lien position. Home equity lines of credit may be originated up to 90% of the value of the property securing the loan if no first mortgage exists, or up to 90% of the value of the property securing the loans if taking into consideration an existing first mortgage. Approximately 46%, or $48.8 million, of our home equity lines at September 30, 2016 require a payment of 1.5% of the outstanding loan balance per month, but have no stated term-to-maturity and no repayment period. Repaid principal may be re-advanced at any time, not to exceed the original credit limit of the loan. Approximately 53%, or $56.3 million, of our home equity lines at September 30, 2016 have a 7-year draw period, a 10-year repayment term, and typically a payment requirement of 1.5% of the outstanding loan balance per month during the draw period, with an amortizing payment during the repayment period. Repaid principal may be re-advanced at any time during the draw period, not to exceed the original credit limit of the loan. We also offer interest-only home equity lines of credit. These loans have a maximum term of 12 months and require monthly payments of accrued interest, and a balloon payment of unpaid principal at maturity. At September 30, 2016, approximately 1%, or $1.0 million, of our home equity lines were interest-only. Closed-end home equity loans, which totaled $17.2 million at September 30, 2016, may be originated up to 95% of the value of the property securing the loans if taking into consideration an existing first mortgage, or the lesser of up to $40 thousand or 25% of the value of the property securing the loan if no first mortgage exists. The term-to-maturity for closed-end home equity loans in the first lien position may be up to 10 years, or may be up to 20 years for loans in the second lien position. Other consumer loan terms vary according to the type of collateral and the length of the contract. Home equity loans, including lines of credit and closed-end loans, comprised approximately 97% of our consumer loan portfolio, or $123.3 million, at September 30, 2016; of that amount, 86% were adjustable-rate. 

The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security in relation to the proposed loan amount. 

Consumer loans generally have shorter terms-to-maturity or reprice more frequently, usually without periodic caps, which reduces our exposure to credit risk and changes in interest rates, and usually carry higher rates of interest than do one- to four-family loans. However, consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do one- to four-family loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. Management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending . At September 30, 2016, the Bank's commercial real estate loans totaled $154.1 million, or approximately 2% of our total loan portfolio. Of this amount, $99.1 million were participation loans. Total undisbursed loan amounts related to commercial real estate loans were $193.4 million, resulting in a total commercial real estate loan concentration of $347.5 million at September 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2016, the Bank entered into commercial real estate loan participations of $201.1 million, of which $34.9 million had been funded as of September 30, 2016. The Bank intends to continue to grow its commercial real estate loan portfolio through participations with correspondent lenders and other lead banks with which the Bank has commercial real estate lending relationships. 

Our commercial real estate loans include a variety of property types, including hotels, office and retail buildings, senior housing facilities, and multi-family dwellings located in Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Arkansas, California, and Montana. Our largest commercial real estate loan was $50.0 million at September 30, 2016, but no funds had been disbursed on this loan at September 30, 2016. The commercial real estate loan with the largest unpaid principal balance at September 30, 2016 was a loan for $24.5 million. 

Underwriting 

The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts, the more complex sources of repayment and the riskier nature of such loans. When participating in a commercial real estate loan, the Bank performs the same underwriting procedures as if the loan was being originated by the Bank. The primary source of repayment is funds from the operation of the subject property. For secondary sources of repayment, the Bank generally requires personal guarantees and also evaluates the real estate collateral. 

When underwriting a commercial real estate loan, several factors are considered, such as the income producing potential of the property to support the debt service, cash equity provided by the borrower, the financial strength of the borrower, tenant and/or guarantor(s), managerial expertise of the borrower or tenant, feasibility studies from the borrower or an independent third party, the marketability of the property and our lending experience with the borrower. For non-owner occupied properties, the Bank has a pre-lease requirement, depending on the property type, and overall strength of the credit. Loans over $750 thousand must be approved by our ALCO while loans over $1.5 million must be approved by our Board of Directors. 

For non-construction properties, the historical net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, generally must be at least 1.25 times the required payments related to the outstanding debt (debt service coverage ratio) at the time of origination. For construction projects, the minimum debt service coverage ratio requirement of 1.25 applies to the projected cash flows, and the borrower must have successful experience with the construction and operation of properties similar to the subject property. As part of the underwriting process, the historical or projected cash flows are stressed under various scenarios to measure the viability of the project given adverse conditions. 

Generally, our maximum LTV ratios conform to supervisory limits, including 65% for raw land, 75% for land development and 80% for commercial real estate loans. Full appraisals on properties securing these loans are performed by independent state certified fee appraisers. Additionally, the Bank has an independent third-party perform a review of each appraisal. The Bank generally requires at least 15% cash equity from the borrower for land acquisition, land development, and commercial real estate construction loans. For non-acquisition, development or construction loans, the equity may be from a combination of cash and the appraised value of the secured property. 

Loan Terms 

Commercial real estate loans generally have amortization terms of 15 to 30 years and maturities ranging from three to 20 years, which generally requires balloon payments of the remaining principal balance. The Bank has participated in a limited number of short-term loans with a maturity of three years or less. These loans are generally construction-only loans or land development loans that require interest-only payments for the entire term of the loan. 

Commercial real estate loans have either fixed or adjustable interest rates based on prevailing market rates. The interest rate on ARM loans is based on a variety of indices, but is generally determined through negotiation with the borrower or determined by the lead bank in the case of a loan participation. The Bank generally allows interest-only payments during the construction phase of a project before requiring amortizing payments once the loan converts to a permanent loan. For permanent loans, the Bank generally requires amortizing payments. 

Additionally, the Bank may include covenants in the loan agreement that allow the Bank to take action when deterioration in the financial strength of the project is detected to potentially prevent the credit from becoming impaired. The covenants are specific to each loan agreement, based on factors such as the purpose of funds, the collateral type, and the financial strength of the project, the borrower and the guarantor, among other factors. 

Monitoring of Risk 

In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on income-producing properties with a principal balance of $1.5 million or more, the borrower is required to provide financial information annually, including borrower financial statements, subject property rental rates and income, maintenance costs, an update of real estate property tax and insurance payments, and personal financial information for the guarantor(s). The annual review process for loans with a principal balance of $1.5 million or more allows the Bank to monitor compliance with loan covenants and review the borrower's performance, including cash flows from operations, debt service coverage, and comparison of performance to projections and year-over-year performance trending. Additionally, the Bank performs a site visit, schedules a drive-by site visit or obtains an update from the lead bank to obtain information regarding the maintenance of the property and surrounding area. Depending on the financial strength of the project and/or the complexity of the borrower's financials, the Bank may also perform a global analysis of cash flows to account for all other properties owned by the borrower or guarantor. If signs of weakness are identified, the Bank may begin performing more frequent financial and/or collateral reviews or will initiate contact with the borrower, or the lead bank will contact the borrower if the loan is a participation loan, to ensure cash flows from operations are maintained at a satisfactory level to meet the debt requirements. Both macro-level and loan-level stress-test scenarios based on existing and forecasted market conditions are part of the on-going portfolio management process for the commercial real estate portfolio. 

Commercial real estate construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate lending. Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property. Construction delays, slower than anticipated stabilization or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower's ability to repay the loan. The Bank takes these risks into consideration during the underwriting process including the requirement of personal guarantees. The Bank mitigates the risk of commercial real estate construction lending during the construction period by monitoring inspection reports from an independent third-party, project budget, percentage of completion, on-site inspections and percentage of advanced funds. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally large dollar loans and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family loans. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the economy or the real estate market. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may become impaired. The Bank regularly monitors the level of risk in the portfolio, including concentrations in such factors as geographic locations, property types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lending relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors.

Asset Quality 

The Bank's traditional underwriting guidelines have provided the Bank with generally low delinquencies and low levels of non-performing assets compared to national levels. Of particular importance is the complete and full documentation required for each loan the Bank originates, participates in or purchases. Generally, one- to four-family owner occupied loans are underwritten according to the "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards, as issued by the CFPB, with total debt-to-income ratios not exceeding 43% of the borrower's verified income. This allows the Bank to make an informed credit decision based upon a thorough assessment of the borrower's ability to repay the loan. 

For one- to four-family loans and consumer loans, when a borrower fails to make a loan payment within 15 days after the due date, a late charge is assessed and a notice is mailed. Collection personnel review all delinquent loan accounts more than 16 days past due. Attempts to contact the borrower occur by personal letter and, if no response is received, by telephone, with the purpose of establishing repayment arrangements for the borrower to bring the loan current. Repayment arrangements must be approved by a designated bank employee. For residential mortgage loans serviced by the Bank, beginning at approximately the 31 st &#32;day of delinquency, and again at approximately the 50 th &#32;day of delinquency, information notices are mailed to borrowers to inform them of the availability of payment assistance programs. Borrowers are encouraged to contact the Bank to initiate the process of reviewing such opportunities. Once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, assuming a loss mitigation solution is not actively in process, a demand letter is issued requiring the loan be brought current or foreclosure procedures will be implemented. Generally, when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent, and an acceptable repayment plan or loss mitigation solution has neither been established nor is in the process of being negotiated, the loan is forwarded to legal counsel to initiate foreclosure. We also monitor whether borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy are meeting their obligation to pay the mortgage debt in accordance with the terms of the bankruptcy petition. 

For purchased loans serviced by a third party, we monitor delinquencies using reports received from the servicers. We monitor these servicer reports to ensure that the servicer is upholding the terms of the servicing agreement. The reports generally provide total principal and interest due and length of delinquency, and are used to prepare monthly management reports and perform delinquent loan trend analysis. Management also utilizes information from the servicers to monitor property valuations and identify the need to charge-off loan balances. The servicers handle collection efforts per the terms of the servicing agreement. 

For commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank, when a borrower fails to make a loan payment within 15 days after the due date, a late notice is mailed. If the loan becomes 30 days or more past due, the Bank begins collection efforts including sending legal notices for payment collection and contacting the borrower by telephone. The primary purpose of such contact is to notify the borrower of the past due payment in case the loan payment was misplaced or lost and to identify any changes in the project's income flow that may affect future loan performance. If it is determined that future loan performance may be adversely affected, the Bank initiates discussions with the borrower regarding plans to ensure cash flow from operations is sufficient to satisfy the debt requirements and meet the loan covenants. Generally, once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, foreclosure procedures are initiated. For participation loans, the lead bank is responsible for all collection efforts and contact with the borrower. However, if the Bank does not receive an expected payment on a participation loan, the Bank contacts the lead bank to determine the cause of the late payment and to initiate discussions with the lead bank of collection efforts, as necessary. See "Lending Practices and Underwriting Standards &#8211; Commercial Real Estate Lending &#8211; Monitoring of Risk" for additional information.

Represents loans required to be reported as nonaccrual pursuant to regulatory reporting requirements, even if the loans are current. At September 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, this amount was comprised of $2.3 million, $2.2 million, $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, of loans that were 30 to 89 days delinquent and were reported as such, and $9.8 million, $7.2 million, $7.7 million, $5.9 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, of loans that were current. 

(2) 

Real estate-related consumer loans where we also hold the first mortgage are included in the one- to four-family category as the underlying collateral is one- to four-family property. 

(3) 

Represents a single property the Bank purchased for a potential branch site but now intends to sell. 

Once a one- to four-family loan is generally 180 days delinquent, a new collateral value is obtained through an appraisal, less estimated selling costs and anticipated PMI receipts. Any loss amounts identified as a result of this review are charged-off. At September 30, 2016, $13.7 million, or 83%, of the one-to four-family loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure had been individually evaluated for loss and any related losses have been charged-off. 

The amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") as of September 30, 2016 included in interest income was $1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. The amount of additional interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and TDRs as of September 30, 2016, if they had performed in accordance with their original terms, was $362 thousand for the year ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table presents the states where the properties securing one percent or more of the total amount of our one- to four-family loans are located and the corresponding balance of loans 30 to 89 days delinquent, 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure, and weighted average LTV ratios for loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure at September 30, 2016. The LTV ratios were based on the current loan balance and either the lesser of the purchase price or original appraisal, or the most recent Bank appraisal, if available. At September 30, 2016, potential losses, after taking into consideration anticipated PMI proceeds and estimated selling costs, have been charged-off.

Troubled Debt Restructurings . For borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, the Bank may grant a concession to the borrower. Generally, the Bank grants a short-term payment concession to borrowers who are experiencing a temporary cash flow problem. The most frequently used concession is to reduce the monthly payment amount for a period of 6 to 12 months, often by requiring payments of only interest and escrow during this period, resulting in an extension of the maturity date of the loan. For more severe situations requiring long-term solutions, the Bank also offers interest rate reductions to currently-offered rates and the capitalization of delinquent interest and/or escrow resulting in an extension of the maturity date of the loan. The Bank does not forgive principal or interest, nor does it commit to lend additional funds, except for situations generally involving the capitalization of delinquent interest and/or escrow not to exceed the original loan balance, to these borrowers. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information related to TDRs. 

The following table presents the Company's TDRs, based on accrual status, at the dates indicated. At September 30, 2016, $15.5 million of TDRs were included in the ACL formula analysis model and $41 thousand of the ACL was related to these loans. The remaining $26.4 million of TDRs at September 30, 2016 were individually evaluated for loss and any potential losses have been charged-off.

Impaired Loans. &#32;&#32; A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Interest income on impaired loans is recognized in the period collected unless the ultimate collection of principal is considered doubtful. The unpaid principal balance of loans reported as impaired at September 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $58.9 million, $57.2 million, and $56.3 million, respectively. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information related to impaired loans. 

Classified Assets. &#32;&#32;In accordance with the Bank's asset classification policy, management regularly reviews the problem assets in the Bank's portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification. Asset classifications are defined as follows: 

&#8226; 

Special mention - These assets are performing assets on which known information about the collateral pledged or the possible credit problems of the borrower(s) have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrower(s) to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the non-performing loan categories. 

&#8226; 

Substandard - An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

&#8226; 

Doubtful - Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent as those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts and conditions and values highly questionable and improbable. 

&#8226; 

Loss - Assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets on the books is not warranted. 

The following table sets forth the recorded investment in assets, classified as either special mention or substandard, as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, there were no loans classified as doubtful, and all loans classified as loss were fully charged-off. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 4. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information related to classified loans.

Allowance for credit losses and Provision for credit losses . &#32;&#32; Management maintains an ACL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the loan portfolio. The ACL is maintained through provisions for credit losses which are either charged to or credited to income. Our ACL methodology considers a number of factors including the trend and composition of delinquent loans, trends in foreclosed property and short sale transactions and charge-off activity, the current status and trends of local and national employment levels, trends and current conditions in the real estate and housing markets, loan portfolio growth and concentrations, industry and peer charge-off information, and certain ACL ratios. For our commercial real estate portfolio, we also consider qualitative factors such as geographic locations, property types, tenant brand name, borrowing relationships, and lending relationships in the case of participation loans, among other factors. See "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses" and "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for a full discussion of our ACL methodology. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 4. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses" for additional information on the ACL. 

The Bank recorded a negative provision for credit losses during the current fiscal year of $750 thousand, compared to a provision for credit losses during the prior year fiscal year of $771 thousand. The negative provision for credit losses during the current fiscal year was due to the continued low level of net loan charge-offs, due partially to improving real estate values, along with improving delinquent loan ratios. The collateral value and historical loss factors within our ACL formula analysis model decreased during the current fiscal year due to the improvement in real estate values and reduction in net loan charge-offs. At September 30, 2016, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.33% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.24% of total loans. At September 30, 2015, loans 30 to 89 days delinquent were 0.41% of total loans and loans 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure were 0.25% of total loans.

As a result of the implementation of a new loan charge-off policy in January 2012 in accordance with regulatory requirements, $3.5 million of specific valuation allowances ("SVAs") were charged-off and are reflected in the year ended September 30, 2012 activity. These charge-offs did not impact the provision for credit losses, and therefore had no additional income statement impact as the amounts were expensed in previous periods. Excluding the $3.5 million of SVAs that were charged off in January 2012, ACL to net charge-offs would have been 3.8x for fiscal year 2012. Management believes it is important to present this ratio excluding the $3.5 million of SVAs charged-off for comparability purposes. 

The distribution of our ACL at the dates indicated is summarized below. Included in bulk purchased loans are $239.1 million of loans, or 57% of the total bulk purchased loan portfolio, at September 30, 2016, for which the seller of the loans has guaranteed, and has the ability, to repurchase or replace any delinquent loans. The Bank has not experienced any losses on loans acquired from this seller as all delinquent loans have been repurchased by this seller since the loan package was purchased in fiscal year 2012. For the $177.6 million of bulk purchased loans at September 30, 2016 that do not have the above noted guarantee, the Bank has continued to experience a reduction in loan losses due to an improvement in collateral values. A large portion of these loans were originally interest-only loans with interest-only terms up to 10 years. All of the interest-only loans are now fully amortizing loans. Our correspondent purchased loans are purchased on a loan-by-loan basis from a select group of correspondent lenders and are underwritten by the Bank's underwriters based on underwriting standards that are generally the same as for our originated loans. The decrease in one- to four-family ACL from September 30, 2015 was due to improvements in collateral value and historical loss factors within our ACL formula analysis model, as well as to the continued low level of net loan charge-offs and delinquent loan ratios, partially offset by growth in the portfolio. The increase in the commercial real estate ACL was due primarily to growth in the portfolio during the current fiscal year.

Investment Activities 

Federally chartered savings institutions have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations; securities of various federal agencies; government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"), including callable agency securities; municipal bonds; certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions; certain bankers' acceptances; repurchase agreements; and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally chartered savings institutions may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly. As a member of FHLB, the Bank is required to maintain a specified investment in FHLB stock. See "Regulation and Supervision &#8211; Federal Home Loan Bank System" and "Office of the Comptroller of the Currency" for a discussion of additional restrictions on our investment activities. 

The Chief Investment Officer has the primary responsibility for management of the Bank's investment portfolio, subject to the direction and guidance of ALCO. The Chief Investment Officer considers various factors when making decisions, including the liquidity, maturity, and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The composition of the investment portfolio will be affected by various market conditions, including the slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the impact on the Bank's interest rate risk, the trend of net deposit flows, the volume of loan sales, the anticipated demand for funds via withdrawals, repayments of borrowings, and loan originations and purchases. 

The general objectives of the Bank's investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing liquidity risk, interest rate risk, reinvestment risk, and credit risk. The portfolio is also intended to create a steady stream of cash flows that can be redeployed into other assets as the Bank grows the loan portfolio, or reinvested into higher yielding assets should interest rates rise. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Cash flow projections are reviewed regularly and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained. 

We classify securities as either trading, available-for-sale ("AFS"), or held-to-maturity ("HTM") at the date of purchase. Securities that are purchased and held principally for resale in the near future are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in the consolidated statements of income. AFS securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") (loss) within stockholders' equity, net of deferred income taxes. HTM securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. We have both the ability and intent to hold our HTM securities to maturity. 

On a quarterly basis, management conducts a formal review of securities for the presence of an other-than-temporary impairment. Management assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment is present when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. For such securities, other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred if the Company intends to sell the security, if it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or if the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost. Management does not believe any other-than-temporary impairments existed at September 30, 2016. 

Investment Securities . Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of debentures issued by GSEs (primarily Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") and the Federal Home Loan Banks) and non-taxable municipal bonds. At September 30, 2016, our investment securities portfolio totaled $382.1 million. The portfolio consisted of securities classified as either HTM or AFS. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 3. Securities" and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Investment Securities" for additional information. 

Our investment securities portfolio decreased $184.7 million from $566.8 million at September 30, 2015 to $382.1 million at September 30, 2016. The decrease in the balance was primarily a result of maturities and calls of $285.2 million, partially offset by purchases of $101.4 million. The cash flows from calls and maturities of investment securities that were not reinvested into the portfolio were used largely to fund loan growth. The purchases during fiscal year 2016 were fixed-rate and had a weighted average yield of 1.09% and a weighted average life ("WAL") of approximately 0.8 years at the time of purchase. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities . At September 30, 2016, our MBS portfolio totaled $1.25 billion. The portfolio consisted of securities classified as either HTM or AFS and were primarily issued by GSEs. The principal and interest payments of MBS issued by GSEs are collateralized by the underlying mortgage assets with principal and interest payments guaranteed by the agencies. The underlying mortgage assets are conforming mortgages that comply with FNMA and FHLMC underwriting guidelines, as applicable, and are therefore not considered subprime. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 3. Securities" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Mortgage-Backed Securities" for additional information. 

Our MBS portfolio decreased $216.5 million from $1.46 billion at September 30, 2015 to $1.25 billion at September 30, 2016. During fiscal year 2016, $142.9 million of MBS were purchased, of which $42.8 million were fixed-rate and $100.1 million were adjustable-rate. The cash flows from MBS that were not reinvested into the portfolio were used largely to fund loan growth. 

MBS generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the servicing fee retained by the servicer and the cost of payment guarantees or credit enhancements that reduce credit risk. However, MBS are generally more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize certain borrowings and public unit deposits of the Bank. In general, MBS issued or guaranteed by FNMA and FHLMC are weighted at no more than 20% for risk-based capital purposes compared to the 50% risk-weighting assigned to most non-securitized one- to four-family loans. 

When securities are purchased for a price other than par value, the difference between the price paid and par is accreted to or amortized against the interest earned over the life of the security, depending on whether a discount or premium to par was paid. Movements in interest rates affect prepayment rates which, in turn, affect the average lives of MBS and the speed at which the discount or premium is accreted to or amortized against earnings. 

At September 30, 2016, the MBS portfolio included $184.8 million of collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"). CMOs are special types of securities in which the stream of principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages or MBS are used to create investment classes with different maturities and, in some cases, different amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each such class possessing different risk characteristics. We do not purchase residual interest bonds. 

While MBS issued by FNMA and FHLMC carry a reduced credit risk compared to whole mortgage loans, these securities remain subject to the risk that a fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors such as the geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of the underlying mortgage loans and consequently affect both the prepayment speed and value of the securities. As noted above, the Bank, on some transactions, pays a premium over par value on MBS purchased. Large premiums could cause significant negative yield adjustments due to accelerated prepayments on the underlying mortgages. The balance of net premiums on our portfolio of MBS at September 30, 2016 was $13.0 million. 

The following table sets forth the composition of our investment and MBS portfolios as of the dates indicated. &#32; &#32;At September 30, 2016, our investment securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our stockholders' equity, excluding those issued by GSEs.

Sources of Funds 

General . Our primary sources of funds are deposits, FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, repayments and maturities of outstanding loans and MBS and other short-term investments, and funds provided by operations. 

Deposits . &#32;&#32;We offer a variety of retail deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts, and certificates of deposit. We rely primarily upon competitive pricing policies, marketing, and customer service to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates, and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to utilize strategic pricing to obtain funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. We seek to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset and liability management, liquidity, and profitability objectives. Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by market conditions. 

The Board of Directors has authorized the utilization of brokers to obtain deposits as a source of funds. Depending on market conditions, the Bank may use brokered deposits to fund asset growth and gather deposits that may help to manage interest rate risk. No brokered deposits were acquired during fiscal year 2016 and there were no brokered deposits outstanding at September 30, 2016 or 2015. 

The Board of Directors also has authorized the utilization of public unit deposits as a source of funds. In order to qualify to obtain such deposits, the Bank must have a branch in each county in which it collects public unit deposits and, by law, must pledge securities as collateral for all such balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the balance of public unit deposits was $370.0 million and $312.4 million, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Bank's policy allows for combined brokered and public unit deposits up to 15% of total deposits. At September 30, 2016, that amount was approximately 7% of total deposits. 

Borrowings . &#32;&#32;We utilize borrowings when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they help us meet our asset and liability management objectives. Historically, our term borrowings have consisted primarily of FHLB advances. FHLB advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, maturity, repayment, and embedded options, if any. All FHLB advances at September 30, 2016 were fixed-rate advances with no embedded options. The Bank supplements FHLB borrowings with repurchase agreements, wherein the Bank enters into agreements with Board approved counterparties to sell securities under agreements to repurchase them. These agreements are recorded as financing transactions as the Bank maintains effective control over the transferred securities. The Bank's internal policy limits total borrowings to 55% of total assets. 

During fiscal year 2016, the Bank continued to utilize a leverage strategy ("daily leverage strategy") to increase earnings. The daily leverage strategy during the current fiscal year involved borrowing up to $2.10 billion on the Bank's FHLB line of credit, which was repaid at each quarter end. The proceeds of the borrowings, net of the required FHLB stock holdings, are deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Management can discontinue the use of the daily leverage strategy at any point in time. 

At September 30, 2016, we had $2.38 billion of FHLB advances, at par, outstanding. Total FHLB borrowings are secured by certain qualifying loans pursuant to a blanket collateral agreement with FHLB. Per FHLB's lending guidelines, total FHLB borrowings cannot exceed 40% &#32;of Bank Call Report total assets without the pre-approval of FHLB senior management. In June 2016, the president of the FHLB renewed the approval of the increase in the Bank's borrowing limit to 55% of Bank Call Report total assets through July 2017. This approval was also in place throughout fiscal year 2016 as FHLB borrowings were in excess of 40% of Call Report total assets at certain points in time during the period due to the daily leverage strategy. 

At September 30, 2016, repurchase agreements totaled $200.0 million, or approximately 2% of total assets. The Bank may enter into additional repurchase agreements as management deems appropriate, not to exceed 15% of total assets and subject to the internal policy limit on total borrowings of 55%. The securities underlying the agreements continue to be reported in the Bank's securities portfolio. At September 30, 2016, we had securities with a fair value of $224.1 million pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are made at mutually agreed upon terms between counterparties and the Bank. The use of repurchase agreements allows for the diversification of funding sources and the use of securities that were not being leveraged as collateral. 

The following table sets forth certain information relating to the category of borrowings for which the average short-term balance outstanding during the period was at least 30% of stockholders' equity at the end of each period shown. The maximum balance, average balance, and weighted average contractual interest rate during the fiscal years shown reflect borrowings that were scheduled to mature within one year at any month-end during those years.

Subsidiary Activities 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had one wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank provides a full range of retail banking services through 47 banking offices serving primarily the metropolitan areas of Topeka, Wichita, Lawrence, Manhattan, Emporia and Salina, Kansas and portions of the metropolitan area of greater Kansas City. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had one wholly-owned subsidiary, Capitol Funds, Inc. At September 30, 2016, Capitol Funds, Inc. had one wholly-owned subsidiary, Capitol Federal Mortgage Reinsurance Company ("CFMRC"), which serves as a reinsurance company for the majority of the PMI companies the Bank uses in its normal course of operations. CFMRC stopped writing new business for the Bank in January 2010. Each wholly-owned subsidiary is reported on a consolidated basis. 

Regulation and Supervision 

Set forth below is a description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to Capitol Federal Financial, Inc. and the Bank. 

General. The Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation and oversight by the OCC extending to all aspects of its operations. This regulation of the Bank is intended for the protection of depositors and other customers and not for the purpose of protecting the Company's stockholders. The Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on capital distributions to the Company. The Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act ("HOLA"). As such, the Company is registered with the FRB and subject to the FRB regulations, examinations, supervision, and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over the Company. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Bank. 

The OCC and FRB enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC or the FRB is required by law. 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The investment and lending authority of the Bank is prescribed by federal laws and regulations and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. 

As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is required to meet a Qualified Thrift Lender ("QTL") test. This test requires the Bank to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets, as defined by statute, in qualified thrift investments at month-end for 9 out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. Under an alternative test, the Bank's business must consist primarily of acquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans, while maintaining 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under either test, the Bank is required to maintain a significant portion of its assets in residential housing related loans and investments. An institution that fails to qualify as a QTL based upon one of these tests is immediately subject to certain restrictions on its operations, including a prohibition against capital distributions, except, with the prior approval of both the OCC and the FRB, as necessary to meet the obligations of a company controlling the institution. If the Bank fails the QTL test and does not regain QTL status within one year, or fails the test for a second time, the Company must immediately register as, and become subject to, the restrictions applicable to a bank holding company. The activities authorized for a bank holding company are more limited than are the activities authorized for a savings and loan holding company. Three years after failing the test, an institution must divest all investments and cease all activities not permissible for both a national bank and a savings association. Failure to meet the Qualified Thrift Lender test is a statutory violation subject to enforcement action. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank met the Qualified Thrift Lender test. 

The Bank is subject to a 35% of total assets limit on non-real estate consumer loans, commercial paper and corporate debt securities, and a 20% limit on commercial non-mortgage loans. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had less than 1% of its assets in non-real estate consumer loans, commercial paper and corporate debt securities and less than 1% of its assets in commercial non-mortgage loans. 

The Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated to a great extent by federal laws and regulations, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage requirements. In addition, the branching authority of the Bank is regulated by the OCC. The Bank is generally authorized to branch nationwide. 

The Bank is subject to a statutory lending limit on aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain common interests. That limit is equal to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. At September 30, 2016, the Bank's lending limit under this restriction was $186.5 million. The Bank has no loans or loan relationships in excess of its lending limit. 

The Bank is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. During these examinations, the examiners may require the Bank to increase its ACL and/or recognize additional charge-offs based on their judgments, which can impact our capital and earnings. &#32; As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to a semi-annual assessment, based upon its total assets, to fund the operations of the OCC. 

The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure, and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution regulated by the OCC that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan. 

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The DIF of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in the Bank up to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to $250 thousand per depositor. 

Prior to July 1, 2016, the FDIC assessed deposit insurance premiums on each FDIC-insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories, applied to its assessment base. An institution's assessment base is equal to average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). An institution with assets reported in its Call Report that have not exceeded $10 billion for at least four consecutive quarters and has been federally insured for at least five years is considered an established small institution and is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital, supervisory ratings, and other factors. The Bank is considered an established small institution. Well-capitalized institutions that were financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses were assigned to Risk Category I. Risk 

Categories II, III and IV present progressively greater risks to the DIF. A range of initial base assessment rates applied to each Risk Category, adjusted downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and, except for an institution in Risk Category I, adjusted upward if the institution's brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits, to produce total base assessment rates. Total base assessment rates ranged from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV, all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution held more than a de minimis &#32;amount of unsecured debt issued by another FDIC-insured institution. 

On April 26, 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule that, effective July 1, 2016, changed the method of calculating assessments for established small institutions effective the quarter following the DIF reserve ratio reaching 1.15%, which occurred on June 30, 2016. Under the final rule, the FDIC established assessment rates for established small institutions based on an institution's weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. The four risk categories noted above were eliminated. Total base assessment rates range from 1.5 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 3 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 11 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS composite scores of 4 or 5, subject to certain adjustments. Assessment rates are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments to the 1.35% ratio required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Formerly, the required reserve ratio was 1.15%. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Bank paid $4.5 million in FDIC premiums. 

&#160; 

An institution that has reported on its Call Reports total assets of $10 billion or more for at least four consecutive quarters is considered a large institution and is assessed under a complex scorecard method employing many factors, including weighted average CAMELS ratings; a performance score; leverage ratio; ability to withstand asset-related stress; certain measures of concentration, core earnings, core deposits, credit quality, and liquidity; and a loss severity score and loss severity measure. Total base assessment rates for these institutions currently range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, subject to certain adjustments, and are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments. 

The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to offset the effects of higher assessments due to the increase in the reserve ratio on established small institutions by charging higher assessments to large institutions. To implement this mandate, large and highly complex institutions must pay an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points on their assessment base beginning July 1, 2016. If the DIF reserve ratio has not reached 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC plans to impose a shortfall assessment on large institutions on March 31, 2019. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2 basis points without further rule-making. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment. 

&#160; 

Since established small institutions will be contributing to the DIF while the reserve ratio remains between 1.15% and 1.35% and the large institutions are paying a surcharge, the FDIC will provide assessment credits to the established small institutions for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase. When the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply an established small institution's assessment credits to reduce its regular deposit insurance assessments. 

FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay additional quarterly assessments called the FICO assessments in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. The rate for these assessments is adjusted quarterly and is applied to the same base as used for the deposit insurance assessment. These assessments are expected to continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, the Bank paid $565 thousand in FICO assessments. 

Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the institution as transactions with non-affiliates, and certain of these transactions are restricted to a percentage of the Bank's capital, and, in the case of loans, require eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, the Bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or purchase or invest in the securities of affiliates. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Bank and Company are required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under regulations of the OCC and FRB, respectively. The current regulatory capital rules, sometimes referred to as the Basel III rules, became effective for the Company and Bank in January 2016, with some rules being transitioned into full effectiveness over two-to-four years. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III rules revised the "prompt corrective action" regulations, by (1) introducing a Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") ratio requirement at each level (other than critically under-capitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (2) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (compared to the previous 6%); and (3) eliminating the provision that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. 

Under the Basel III rules, an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution, such as the Company and the Bank, was allowed to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude certain AOCI items for the purpose of determining regulatory capital ratios. Management made this election in order to remove any volatility related to AOCI from the Company's and Bank's capital ratios. &#32;&#32; At September 30, 2016, the Bank had $5.9 million of AOCI. 

Regulatory risk-weighted capital guidelines assign a certain risk weighting to every asset. Certain off-balance sheet items, such as binding loan commitments, are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate the amounts into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings. The risk weights for the Bank's and Company's assets and off-balance sheet items generally range from 0% to 150%. At September 30, 2016, the Bank and the Company each had risk-weighted assets of $4.34 billion. 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Bank reported in its Call Report quarterly average assets of $11.31 billion and the Company reported to the FRB quarterly average assets of $11.31 billion. These average asset amounts are significantly higher than total assets at September 30, 2016 due the daily leverage strategy being in place during the quarter but not at September 30, 2016. 

CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital for the Company and the Bank consists of common stock plus related surplus and retained earnings. Tier 2 capital for the Company and the Bank includes the balance of ACL; however, the amount of includable ACL in Tier 2 capital may be limited if the amount exceeds 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had $8.5 million of ACL, which was less than the 1.25% risk-weighted assets limit; therefore, the entire amount of ACL was includable in Tier 2 and total risk-based capital. Total capital for the Company and the Bank consists of common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings (Tier 1 capital) plus the amount of includable ACL (Tier 2 capital). 

Under the Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets. 

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio"). 

Basel III requires the Company and the Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer above certain minimum capital ratios for capital adequacy purposes in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and other payments including dividends, share repurchases, and certain compensation. This requirement became effective January 1, 2016, and is being phased in over a four year period by increasing the required buffer amount by 0.625% each year. Once fully phased-in, the organization must maintain a balance of CET1 capital that exceeds by more than 2.5% each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to satisfy the requirement. This translates into the following for the risk-based capital ratios when the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (1) CET1 capital ratio of more than 7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital ratio of more than 8.5%, and (3) Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) ratio of more than 10.5%. At September 30, 2016, the Bank and Company had capital greater than necessary to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement then in effect. 

At September 30, 2016, the Bank was considered well capitalized under OCC regulations. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Note 12. Regulatory Capital Requirements" and "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional regulatory capital information 

The OCC has the ability to establish an individual minimum capital requirement for a particular institution, which varies from the capital levels that would otherwise be required under the capital regulations, based on such factors as concentrations of credit risk, levels of interest rate risk, and the risks of non-traditional activities as well as others. The OCC has not imposed any such requirement on the Bank. 

The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against savings banks that fail to meet the minimum ratios for an adequately capitalized institution. Any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and, until such plan is approved by the OCC, may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions. The plan must include a guaranty by the institution's holding company limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution's assets when it became undercapitalized, or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. The OCC is authorized to impose the additional restrictions on institutions that are less than adequately capitalized. 

Federal regulations state that any institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or has a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% is considered significantly undercapitalized and must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and operating restrictions that may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution. An institution with tangible equity to total assets of less than 2.0% is critically undercapitalized and becomes subject to further mandatory restrictions on its operations. The OCC generally is authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. The imposition by the OCC of any of these measures on the Bank may have a substantial adverse effect on its operations and profitability. In general, the FDIC must be appointed receiver for a critically undercapitalized institution whose capital is not restored within the time provided. When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor (for deposits covered by FDIC insurance) have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution.

In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ("SAFE Act"), and the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"). In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties. 

The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of an FDIC-insured institution, to assess its record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The federal banking regulators take into account the institution's record of performance under the CRA when considering applications for mergers, acquisitions, and branches. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial non-compliance. The Bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent CRA evaluation. 

Bank Secrecy Act /Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity and source of deposits and wealth of its customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.

Stress Testing. &#32;As required by the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations of the FRB and the OCC, FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion must conduct annual, company-run stress tests under the baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal banking regulators. For this purpose, average total consolidated assets means the average, as of the end of the four most recent consecutive quarterly periods, of total consolidated assets reported in the Call Report or quarterly report to the FRB. The regulators may also require the use of additional scenarios. The stress test is a process to assess the potential impact of scenarios on the 

consolidated earnings, losses and capital of an institution over the planning horizon, taking into account the institution's condition, risks, exposures, strategies and activities. The purpose of the stress tests is to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning that accounts for their risks and to help ensure that institutions have sufficient capital throughout times of economic and financial stress. The Company and the Bank are not subject to this requirement as their average total consolidated assets for this purpose are not greater than $10 billion. 

Federal Securities Law. The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

The Company stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. For this purpose, affiliates are generally considered to be executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period. 

Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. At September 30, 2016, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." An eligible institution need not exhaust other sources of funds before going to the discount window, nor are there restrictions on the purposes for which the borrower can use primary credit. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of FHLB Topeka, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for its members within its assigned region and is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans, called advances, to members and provides access to a line of credit in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA"). 

As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain capital stock in FHLB. The minimum required FHLB stock amount is generally 4.5% of the Bank's FHLB advances and outstanding balance against the FHLB line of credit, and 2% of the outstanding principal of loans sold into the Mortgage Partnership Finance program. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had a balance of $110.0 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue. On a quarterly basis, management conducts a review of FHLB to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment of the FHLB stock is present. At September 30, 2016, management concluded there was no such impairment. 

Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation. The purpose and powers of the Company are to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a savings and loan holding company and to exercise any of the powers accorded to a savings and loan holding company. 

The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company (directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries) from acquiring another savings association, or holding company thereof, without prior written approval from the FRB; acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary savings association, a non-subsidiary holding company, or a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA; or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by savings and loan holding companies to acquire savings associations, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community, competitive factors, and other factors. 

The Dodd-Frank Act extended to savings and loan holding companies the FRB's "source of strength" doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies. The FRB has promulgated regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

Taxation 

Federal Taxation 

General 

The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company is no longer subject to federal income tax examination for fiscal years prior to 2013. 

Method of Accounting 

For federal income tax purposes, the Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on September 30 for filing its federal income tax return. 

Minimum Tax 

The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of the regular tax. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers 

For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no net operating loss carryovers. 

State Taxation 

The earnings/losses of Capitol Federal Financial, Inc. and Capitol Funds, Inc. are combined for purposes of filing a consolidated Kansas corporate tax return. The Kansas corporate tax rate is 4.0%, plus a surcharge of 3.0% on earnings greater than $50 thousand. 

The Bank files a Kansas privilege tax return. For Kansas privilege tax purposes, the minimum tax rate is 4.5% of earnings, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. The Bank has not received notification from the state of any potential tax liability for any years still subject to audit. 

Additionally, the Bank files state tax returns in various other states where it has significant purchased loans and/or foreclosure activities. In these states, the Bank has either established nexus under an economic nexus theory or has exceeded enumerated nexus thresholds based on the amount of interest derived from sources within the state.
