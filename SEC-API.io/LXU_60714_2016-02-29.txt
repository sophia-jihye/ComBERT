 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

LSB Industries, Inc. (&#8220;LSB&#8221; or &#8220;Registrant&#8221;) was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. LSB is a diversified holding company involved in manufacturing operations through its subsidiaries. LSB and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) own the following core businesses: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Chemical Business manufactures and sells nitrogen-based chemical products for the agricultural, industrial, and mining markets that it produces from four facilities located in El Dorado, Arkansas (the &#8220;El Dorado Facility&#8221;); Cherokee, Alabama (the &#8220;Cherokee Facility&#8221;); Pryor, Oklahoma (the &#8220;Pryor Facility&#8221;); and Baytown, Texas (the &#8220;Baytown Facility&#8221;). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Climate Control Business manufactures and sells a broad range of HVAC products that includes water source and geothermal heat pumps, hydronic fan coils, large custom air handlers, modular geothermal and other chillers, and other related products and services. These products are primarily used in commercial/institutional and residential new-building construction, renovation of existing buildings and replacement of existing systems. Our Climate Control Business manufactures and distributes its products from seven facilities located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

Our Reportable Business Segments 

Chemical Business 

General 

Our Chemical Business supplies chemical products to some of the world&#8217;s leading chemical and industrial companies. Focusing on specific geographic areas, we utilize freight and distribution advantages over many of our competitors. We also believe our Chemical Business has established leading regional market positions.

Our Chemical Business manufactures products for three principal markets:

&#160;

&#183; 

ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (&#8220;AN&#8221;), urea ammonia nitrate (&#8220;UAN&#8221;), and AN solution for agricultural applications, 

&#160;

&#183; 

high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid for industrial applications, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

industrial grade AN and solutions for the mining industry. 

Our agricultural products comprise 49% of our chemical sales. We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although we periodically enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products. Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts and/or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of raw material feedstock as a pass through component in the sales price. These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.

Market Conditions - Chemical Business 

As discussed in more detail under &#8220;Key Industry Factors&#8221; of &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) contained in this report, agricultural fertilizer demand is a significant driver of our sales volumes. This demand is driven by the number of acres planted of crops, principally corn, requiring fertilizer to enhance yield. Corn prices affect the number of acres of corn planted in a given year, and the number of acres planted will drive nitrogen fertilizer consumption, likely driving ammonia, UAN and urea prices. Weather also has an impact on fertilizer application and consumption. The 2014 corn crop produced record production and yields per acre that resulted in significantly higher year-end stock to use ratios compared to the last ten years average. This increase resulted in 2 million fewer acres of corn planted in 2015, approximately 88 million acres down from 91 million acres, which in turn, resulted in the 2015 corn crop being down 53 million bushels compared to 2014&#8217;s record year. While world stock to use ratios are up, current U.S. stock to use ratios, while having increased over the past five years, remain in line with historical levels. Estimates for 2016 are an increase of 2 million acres of corn being planted resulting in a total of over 90 million acres planted. As a result, the fundamentals are positive for nitrogen fertilizers that are necessary to enhance the yield per acre for most major crops. 

However, there was an abbreviated 2015 fall fertilizer application season, resulting from unusually wet weather, and there was an increase in fertilizer inventories. This increase in inventories had a significant negative effect on the current pricing of fertilizers, reducing overall selling prices. However, it is anticipated that the 2016 spring application of fertilizer will require additional fertilizer to be applied to make up for the shortage of fertilizer applied in the fall. The expected increase in fertilizer applications when combined with the additional acres to be planted in 2016, may be catalysts for selling prices to increase from current levels.

In the industrial and mining markets, sales volumes are driven by general economic conditions, energy prices, and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers. As reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;), annual coal production for 2015 is estimated to be down 11% from the prior year with a further reduction of 6% estimated for 2016. U.S. coal production is being negatively impacted by low natural gas prices among other things. In addition, other mining operations are being negatively impacted by commodity price decreases.

As natural gas is the basic feedstock for the production of ammonia, North American ammonia producers have a natural gas cost advantage due to the current historically low price of natural gas and it is expected that the price of natural gas will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future. Based upon most estimates, including Blue Johnson &#38; Associates, Inc., the U.S. imports approximately 32% of its annual ammonia consumption. However, the fertilizer outlook could change as the result of, among other things, changes in domestic fertilizer production capacity, acres planted of crops, weather conditions, commodity prices, and volume of imported agricultural products. 

One additional factor that is expected to affect the overall nitrogen market is the number of nitrogen expansion projects under construction in the U.S, including our expansion project at our El Dorado Facility (the &#8220;El Dorado Expansion&#8221;) discussed under &#8220;MD&#38;A - Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; These expansion projects are expected to increase production capacity in total by approximately 5 million to 6 million tons of ammonia annually. All of these projects are currently scheduled to begin producing ammonia and other upgraded nitrogen products by early 2018. In addition, there are a number of other announced green field projects where construction has not yet begun and, if they were to be completed, the production would not begin until 2019 at the earliest. The amount and timing of additional nitrogen capacity could have a negative effect on prices of nitrogen-based products in the future.

Agricultural Products 

Our Chemical Business produces UAN, agricultural grade AN, and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers. Farmers and ranchers decide which type of nitrogen-based fertilizer to apply based on the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional farming practices and relative nitrogen fertilizer prices. Our agricultural markets include a high concentration of pastureland and row crops, which favor our products. We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S. We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice. During the past few years, we have been successful in expanding outside our traditional markets by delivering to distributors on the Tennessee and Ohio rivers by barge, and by delivering to certain Western States by rail. 

In November 2015, one of our subsidiaries within our Chemical Business, El Dorado Chemical Company (&#8220;EDC&#8221;) and Koch Fertilizer entered into an ammonia purchase and sale agreement under which Koch Fertilizer agrees to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, the ammonia that is in excess of El Dorado&#8217;s internal needs as the result of the El Dorado Expansion.

Our agricultural business establishes long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sells directly to agricultural end-users through our network of 11 wholesale and retail distribution centers. In addition, our Chemical Business has an agreement with a third-party purchaser to buy, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at the Pryor Facility. The term of the agreement runs through June 2016, but may be terminated earlier by either party pursuant to the terms of the agreement. We intend to renew this contract or one similar with this third-party purchaser or another third-party purchaser. 

Industrial Acids and Other Chemical Products

Our Chemical Business manufactures and sells industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries. In addition, our Chemical Business produces and sells blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants.

We believe the Baytown Facility is one of the newest, largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S. The majority of the Baytown Facility&#8217;s production is sold to Covestro AG, (formerly Bayer MaterialScience, LLC) pursuant to a long-term contract that provides for a pass-through of certain costs, including the ammonia costs, plus a fixed dollar profit and performance incentives (the&#8221; Covestro Agreement&#8221;). The term of the Covestro Agreement runs until June 2021 with options for renewal with Covestro&#8217;s consent.

Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.

Mining Products 

Our mining business manufactures industrial grade AN and 83% AN solution. Until April 2015, El Dorado Chemical Company (&#8220;EDC&#8221;), a subsidiary within our Chemical Business supplied Orica International Pte Ltd (&#8220;Orica&#8221;) with an annual minimum of 240,000 tons of industrial grade AN pursuant to a cost plus a fixed dollar amount of profit supply agreement. The agreement with Orica (the &#8220;Orica Agreement&#8221;) also included an exclusivity arrangement that provided that EDC would not sell industrial grade AN to the commercial explosives market in the U.S. during the term of the agreement and that Orica would market EDC&#8217;s industrial grade AN to the U.S. commercial explosives market in North America during the term of the agreement. The agreement with Orica expired on April 9, 2015 and we began selling Low Density Ammonium Nitrate Prills (&#8220;LDAN&#8221;) directly to explosive distributors, mining companies and aggregate companies who sell into the coal mining metals mining and construction industries. However, we are currently disadvantaged compared to our competitors since we are purchasing ammonia to produce AN and AN solution, making us a high cost producer. This will continue until the construction of the ammonia plant at the El Dorado Facility is completed and begins production as we have signed contracts with customers that, beginning in 2016, provide for the sale of LDAN for approximately 150,000 tons per year under various natural gas cost plus a fixed dollar amount pricing arrangements. With the recent downturn in the mining industry, we are unsure if we will reach these sales volumes. Unlike the Orica Agreement, which contained take-or-pay provisions, only certain of these contracts include minimum annual volume levels with penalty payments if minimum volumes are not met. We expect that if these contracted annual volumes are purchased, they should supplant a majority of the previously contracted volume under the Orica Agreement. However, if customers do not purchase at minimum volume levels we will likely have unutilized capacity of LDAN.

For comparison purposes, the following table summarizes net sales to Orica:

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, net sales to Orica above included approximately $3 million, $15 million and $12 million, respectively, for fixed overhead costs and gross profit for tons not taken by Orica, pursuant to the terms of the Orica Agreement. 

Dependence on Limited Number of Customers - Chemical Business

Historically, our Chemical Business has relied on a limited number of customers as discussed in our risk factors under Item 1A included in this report. 

Raw Materials - Chemical Business 

The products our Chemical Business manufactures are primarily derived from the following raw material feedstocks: ammonia and natural gas. These raw material feedstocks are commodities, subject to price fluctuations.

Purchased ammonia currently is the raw material feedstock for all of the El Dorado Facility&#8217;s production of nitrogen products. Although ammonia is produced from natural gas, the price does not necessarily follow the spot price of natural gas in the U.S. Ammonia is an internationally traded commodity and the relative price is set in the world market while natural gas is primarily a domestically traded commodity. Currently, the ammonia supply to the El Dorado Facility is transported from the Gulf of Mexico by pipeline. Under the current agreement with its principal supplier of ammonia, EDC will have the ability to purchase a majority of its ammonia requirements through the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the date on which the new ammonia plant comes on stream. We believe that we can obtain ammonia from other sources in the event of an interruption of service under the above-referenced contract including from our company owned Pryor and Cherokee Facilities.

The El Dorado Expansion includes expanding our nitrogen fertilizer operations at the El Dorado Facility with the addition of a 1,150 ton per day (approximately 375,000 tons per year) ammonia plant, which we believe under normal conditions will allow us to produce enough ammonia to eliminate our external ammonia purchase requirements and should provide us with approximately 150,000 tons per year of additional ammonia available for sale or to upgrade into other products. This expansion is anticipated to be operational early in the second quarter of 2016 with full production levels being achieved during the second half of 2016. Once the expansion is complete, our annual natural gas requirements for this facility will be approximately 13 million MMBtu of natural gas per year.

Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN and other products at the Cherokee and Pryor Facilities. Under normal circumstances when running at a full year production schedule, the Cherokee Facility would purchase approximately 6 million MMBtu of natural gas per year in order to produce approximately 175,000 tons of ammonia and the Pryor Facility would purchase approximately 7 million MMBtu of natural gas to produce approximately 215,000 tons of ammonia.

The Cherokee and Pryor Facilities&#8217; natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price as will the natural gas feedstock requirements of the El Dorado Facility when its ammonia plant is in production. Periodically, we enter into firm purchase commitments and/or futures/forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements. For 2016 we have forward purchase commitments of natural gas for approximately 3 million MMBtus for our Cherokee Facility, approximately 2 million MMBtus for our Pryor Facility and approximately 2 million MMBtus for our El Dorado Facility at an average cost of $2.76 per MMBtu. This represents approximately 30% of our exposed natural gas usage at each facility for 2016. 

The Baytown Facility normally purchases approximately 135,000 tons of ammonia per year. Under the Covestro Agreement, there is a pass-through of certain costs, including the ammonia costs. 

In addition, Zena Energy, L.L.C., a subsidiary within our Chemical Business owns certain natural gas working interests in natural gas properties located in the Marcellus Shale Formation in the state of Pennsylvania. Since our Chemical Business purchases a significant amount of natural gas as a feedstock for the production of ammonia, management considers these working interests as an economic hedge against a potential rise in natural gas prices. We report the working interests as part of the Chemical Business reportable segment. 

See further discussion relating to the outlook for the Chemical Business under &#8220;Key Industry Factors&#8221; in our MD&#38;A contained in this report.

Strategy - Chemical Business

Our Chemical Business pursues a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that provide for the pass through of raw material and other manufacturing costs. We believe that this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have consistent levels of production and helps mitigate the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstocks and/or the changes in demand for our products. For 2015, approximately 50% of the Chemical Business&#8217; sales were to the industrial and mining markets and approximately 49% of our Chemical Business 2015 sales were to the agricultural markets, primarily at the market price at the time of sale.

The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers is to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the ammonia and natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources. This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products can compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product in this market. Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude the Chemical Business from 

balancing production and storage capabilities. Looking forward, we are pursuing profitable growth of our Chemical Business, including the potential to increase the output of our existing production facilities. See further discussion under &#8220;Capital Additions&#8221; of our MD&#38;A contained in this report. Our strategy calls for continued emphasis on the agricultural sector, while remaining committed to further developing industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector. 

Our strategy also includes evaluating investment in expansion projects that we believe will generate the best returns for our stockholders taking into consideration the risk and return on investment. This strategy motivated our decision to build the ammonia plant at the El Dorado Facility and to construct a new nitric acid plant and concentrator at the El Dorado Facility. During 2015, we completed the construction of the new nitric acid plant and concentrator. We believe that upon completion of the ammonia plant in 2016, the El Dorado Facility will benefit from reduced feedstock costs, expanded capacity, improved efficiency and enhanced product mix flexibility.

Seasonality - Chemical Business

We believe chemical products sold by our Chemical Business to the agricultural industry are seasonal while sales into the industrial and mining sectors generally are not. The selling seasons for agricultural products are primarily during the spring and fall planting seasons, which typically extend from March through June and from September through November in the geographical markets in which the majority of our agricultural products are distributed. As a result, our Chemical Business typically increases its inventory of AN prior to the beginning of each planting season. In addition, the amount and timing of sales to the agricultural markets depend upon weather conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. 

Regulatory Matters - Chemical Business

Our Chemical Business is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations as discussed under &#8220;Environmental, Health and Safety Matters" of this Item 1 and various risk factors under Item 1A.

Competition - Chemical Business

Our Chemical Business operates in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Agrium, CF Industries, Chemtrade Logistics, CVR Partners, Rentech Nitrogen Partners, OCI Partners, Solvay, Dyno Nobel, Gavilon Fertilizer, Helm, Koch, Norfalco, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Praxair, Quad Chemical, Trammo and Yara International (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe that competition within the markets served by our Chemical Business is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.

Climate Control Business 

General 

Our Climate Control Business manufactures and sells a broad range of standard and custom designed water source and geothermal heat pumps, hydronic fan coils, large custom air handlers and air and water cooled chillers. These products are for use in commercial/institutional and residential HVAC systems. Our products are installed in some of the most recognizable commercial/institutional developments in the U.S., including the West Point Military Academy, Buffet Cancer Center, BMW, NYU Medical Center, Pfizer, Rockefeller Plaza, and Trump Tower. In addition, we have a significant presence in the lodging sector with installations in numerous Hyatt, Marriott, Four Seasons, Starwood, Ritz Carlton, Wynn, and Hilton hotels, among others. 

We believe our Climate Control Business has developed leadership positions in certain product categories by offering extensive product lines and customized products focusing on higher efficiency and &#8220;green&#8221; technologies. We believe we have developed the most extensive line of water source and geothermal heat pumps and hydronic fan coils in the U.S. and that we are a pioneer in the use of geothermal technology, one of the most energy efficient climate control systems commercially available today. Employing highly flexible production capabilities, we produce both semi-custom and custom design units for new construction as well as the retrofit and replacement markets. This flexibility positions us for growth in commercial/institutional and residential construction markets as those markets continue to recover over the next several years.

Our geothermal heating and air conditioning products are considered &#8220;green&#8221; technology and a form of renewable energy. We believe our geothermal systems are among the most energy efficient systems available in the market for heating and cooling applications in commercial/institutional and single family new construction as well as replacement and renovation markets. Based upon market data supplied by the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (&#8220;AHRI&#8221;), we believe we continue to maintain a market share leadership position in this sector of the market.

Market Conditions - Climate Control Business

As discussed in more detail in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; contained in this report, information available from the Dodge Construction Market Forecast Service (&#8220;CMFS&#8221;) indicates that construction activity in the commercial/institutional markets we serve (including multi-family residential structures) is expected to increase 8%, 7% and 5% in the aggregate from 2016 - 2018 and has surpassed pre-recession levels collectively. In particular, the education, office and healthcare vertical end markets of the commercial/institutional sector are expected to grow faster than other vertical end markets we serve. Additionally, single-family residential construction is expected to grow 20% during 2016 to 805,000 units but still remains well below the 1.5 million unit pre-recession levels. In addition to that, we believe low energy prices are adversely affecting new geothermal installations due to the higher installation costs for geothermal as compared to other systems.

Additionally, tax credits and incentives contained in the American Reinvestment Recovery Act of 2009, may have improved sales of our geothermal heat pump products, as well as other &#8220;green&#8221; products. These tax credits and incentives are scheduled to expire at the end of 2016, which could have an impact on both residential and commercial geothermal heat pump sales if they are not extended.

Water Source and Geothermal Heat Pumps 

We believe our Climate Control Business is the leading provider of water source and geothermal heat pumps to the commercial/institutional markets, as well as to single and multi-family residential markets for new construction, renovation and replacement in the U.S.

Water source heat pumps are highly efficient heating and cooling products, which can enable individual room climate control through the transfer of heat using a water pipe system connected to a centralized cooling tower or heat injector. Water source heat pumps enjoy a broad range of commercial/institutional applications, particularly in medium to large sized buildings with many small, individually controlled spaces. We believe our sales of commercial/institutional water source heat pumps should continue to grow as we continue to invest in new products. These developments will provide our distribution channel, engineers and building owners with product and system features that deliver higher efficiency and long-term value compared to other types of heating and air conditioning systems, whether for new construction, renovation or replacement purposes. The largest markets we serve are the single-family residential sector plus the multi-family, education and office markets in the commercial/institutional sector. Out of these markets, we believe all but the single-family residential market are forecast to show solid opportunity for growth going forward. 

Geothermal systems, which circulate water or a combination of water and antifreeze through an underground heat exchanger, are considered to be the most energy efficient systems currently available in the market. 

Hydronic Fan Coils 

We believe that our Climate Control Business is a leading provider of hydronic fan coils targeting commercial and institutional markets including hospitality, multi-family and education sectors. Hydronic fan coils use heated or chilled water provided by a centralized chiller and/or boiler, through a water pipe system, to condition the air and allow individual room control. Hydronic fan coil systems are quieter and, have longer lives and lower maintenance costs than other comparable systems used where individual room control is required. Hydronic fan coils are effective in medium to large sized buildings with many small, individually controlled spaces . 

Production and Backlog - Climate Control Business 

We manufacture our products in many sizes and configurations, as required by the customer, to fit the space and capacity requirements of hotels, schools, hospitals, apartment buildings, condominiums, office buildings other commercial/institutional structures, and single family residences. Our backlog consists of confirmed customer orders for product to be shipped at a future date.

Most customers place their product orders well in advance of required delivery dates. The backlog of confirmed customer product orders are discussed under &#8220;Key Operational Factors &#8211; Climate Control Business&#8221; of the MD&#38;A contained in this report.

Distribution - Climate Control Business

Our Climate Control Business sells its products primarily to mechanical contractors, independent manufacturers&#8217; representatives, independent wholesale distributors and original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;s). Our commercial sales to mechanical contractors primarily occur through independent manufacturers' representatives, who also represent complementary product lines not manufactured by us. Our single-family residential sales are primarily made through distributors. OEMs generally consist of other air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers who resell under their own brand name the products purchased from our Climate Control Business. 

Selling Markets - Climate Control Business

Our Climate Control Business market includes commercial/institutional and residential new building construction, renovation of existing buildings and replacement of existing systems.

Numerous domestic and foreign sources exist for the materials and components used by our Climate Control Business, which include compressors, electrical components, electric motors, copper, steel, and valves. We do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining the necessary materials and components for our Climate Control Business. Although we believe we will be able to pass to our customers the majority of any cost increases in the form of higher prices, the timing of these price increases could lag the increases in the cost of materials and components. While we believe we will have sufficient sources for materials and components, a shortage could adversely affect production and costs of our Climate Control products.

Competition - Climate Control Business

Our Climate Control Business operates in a highly competitive market with many other larger HVAC manufacturing companies, such as Carrier Corporation (United Technologies Corporation), Nortek Inc., Trane (Ingersoll-Rand Public Limited Company), WaterFurnace (NIBE Industrier), Bosch Group, Haakon Industries Ltd., McQuay (Daikin Industries, Ltd.) and Energy Labs Inc., some of whom are also our customers. Some of our competitors serve other markets and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe our Climate Control Business manufactures a broader line of geothermal and water source heat pump and fan coil products than any other manufacturer in the U.S. and that we are competitive as to price, service, warranty and product performance.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (the &#8220;Environmental Laws and Health Laws&#8221;). In particular, the manufacture, production and distribution of products by our Chemical Business are activities that entail environmental and public health risks and impose obligations under the (Environmental Laws and Health Laws), many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws. The Environmental Laws and Health Laws and enforcement policies thereunder have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products. Historically, subsidiaries within our Chemical Business have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with the Environmental Laws and Health Laws and are reasonably expected to do so in the future. We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our Chemical Business facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility. We do not operate the natural gas wells where we own an interest and compliance with Environmental Laws and Health Laws is controlled by others, with our Chemical Business still being responsible for its proportionate share of the costs involved.
