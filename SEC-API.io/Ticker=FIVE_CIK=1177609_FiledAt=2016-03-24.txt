Our Company 

Five Below is a rapidly growing specialty value retailer offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at the teen and pre-teen customer. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, all priced at $5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across a number of our category worlds: Style , Room , Sports , Tech , Crafts , Party, Candy &#32;and Now . We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a unique merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept that our customers consider fun and exciting. Based on management&#8217;s experience and industry knowledge, we believe our compelling value proposition and the dynamic nature of our merchandise offering have fostered universal appeal to teens and pre-teens, as well as customers across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic. 

We opened the first Five Below store in the greater Philadelphia area in 2002 and, since then, have been expanding across the Northeast, South and Midwest regions of the United States of America. As of January 30, 2016 , we operated a total of 437 &#32;locations across 27 &#32;states. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 7,500 &#32;square feet and is typically located within power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets. We opened 71 &#32;net new stores in fiscal 2015 &#32;and plan to open approximately 85 &#32;new stores in fiscal 2016 . We believe that we have the opportunity to grow our store base to more than 2,000 locations over time . 

We believe that our business model has resulted in strong financial performance irrespective of the economic environment: 

&#8226; 

We have achieved positive comparable store sales during each of the last 39 &#32;fiscal quarters. 

&#8226; 

Our comparable store sales increased by 3.4% &#32;in fiscal 2015 , 3.4% &#32;in fiscal 2014 , and 4.0% &#32;in fiscal 2013 . 

&#8226; 

We expanded our store base from 304 &#32;stores at the end of fiscal year 2013 &#32;to 437 &#32;stores at the end of fiscal year 2015 , representing a compounded annual growth rate of 19.9% . 

&#8226; 

Between fiscal 2013 &#32;and 2015 , our net sales increased from $535.4 million &#32;to $832.0 million , representing a compounded annual growth rate of 24.7% . Over the same period, our operating income increased from $53.7 million &#32;to $92.9 million , representing a compounded annual growth rate of 31.5% . 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following strengths differentiate Five Below from competitors and are the key drivers of our success: 

&#8226; 

Unique Focus on the Teen and Pre-Teen Customer. We target an attractive customer segment of teens and pre-teens with trend-right merchandise at differentiated price points of $5 and below. We have built our concept to appeal to this customer base, which we believe to be economically influential and resilient based on our industry knowledge and experience, as well as their parents and others who shop for them. Our brand concept, merchandising strategy and store ambience work in concert to create an upbeat and vibrant retail experience that is designed to appeal to our target audience, drive traffic to our stores and keep our customers engaged throughout their visits. We monitor trends in the ever-changing teen and pre-teen markets and are able to quickly identify and respond to trends that become mainstream. Our price points enable teens and pre-teens to shop independently, often using their own money to make frequent purchases of items geared primarily to them and to exercise self-expression through their independent retail purchases. 

&#8226; 

Broad Assortment of Trend-Right, High-Quality Merchandise with Universal Appeal. We deliver an edited assortment of trend-right as well as everyday products within each of our category worlds that changes frequently to create a sense of anticipation and freshness, which we believe provides excitement for our customers. We have a broad range of vendors, most of which are domestically-based, which enables us to shorten response lead times, maximizes our speed to market and equips us to make more informed buying decisions. Our unique approach encourages frequent customer visits and limits the cyclical fluctuations experienced by many other specialty retailers. The breadth, depth and quality of our product mix and the diversity of our category worlds attract shoppers across a broad range of age and socio-economic demographics. 

&#8226; 

Exceptional Value Proposition for Customers. We believe we offer a clear value proposition to our customers. Our price points of $5 and below resonate with our target demographic and with other value-oriented customers. We are able to deliver on this value proposition through sourcing products in a manner that is designed to achieve low cost, fast response and high item velocity and sell-through. We maintain a dynamic and collaborative relationship with our vendor partners that provide us with favorable access to quality merchandise at attractive prices. We also employ an opportunistic buying strategy, capitalizing on select excess inventory opportunities with our vendors. This unique and flexible sourcing strategy allows us to offer high-quality products at exceptional value across all of our category worlds. 

&#8226; 

Differentiated Shopping Experience. We believe we have created a unique and engaging in-store atmosphere that customers find fun and exciting. While we refresh our products frequently, we maintain a consistent floor layout, designed with an easy-to-navigate racetrack flow and featuring sight-lines across the entire store enabling customers to easily identify our category worlds. All of our stores feature a sound system playing trend-right music throughout the shopping day. We employ novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage. This approach makes our stores a destination, encouraging hands-on interaction with our products and conveying our value pricing. We have developed a unique culture that emanates from our employees, many of whom frequently shop at Five Below, to our customers, thereby driving a higher level of connectivity and engagement. Additionally, we believe our price points of $5 and below, coupled with our dynamic merchandising approach, create an element of discovery, driving repeat visits and customer engagement. 

&#8226; 

Powerful and Consistent Store Economics. We have a proven store model that generates strong cash flow, consistent store-level financial results and a high level return on investment. Our stores have been successful in varying geographic regions, population densities and real estate settings and our new stores have achieved average payback periods of less than one year. We believe our robust store model, reinforced by our rigorous site selection process and in-store execution, drives the strength and consistency of our comparable store sales financial results across all geographic regions and store-year classes. 

&#8226; 

Highly Experienced and Passionate Senior Management Team with Proven Track Record. Our senior management team, led by Thomas Vellios, our Executive Chairman, and Joel Anderson, our President and Chief Executive Offer, has extensive retail experience across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, real estate, finance, store operations, supply chain management and information technology. Our management team drives our operating philosophy, which is based on a relentless focus on providing high-quality merchandise at exceptional value and a superior shopping experience utilizing a disciplined, low-cost operating and sourcing structure. We believe our management team is integral to our success and has positioned us well for long-term growth. 

Growth Strategy 

We believe we can grow our net sales and earnings by executing on the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Grow Our Store Base. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our store base in the United States from 437 &#32;locations as of January 30, 2016 &#32;to more than 2,000 locations within the United States over time. Based upon our strategy of store densification in existing markets and expanding into adjacent states and markets, we expect most of our near-term growth will occur within our existing markets, as well as contiguous new markets. This strategy allows us to benefit from enhanced brand awareness and achieve operational efficiencies. We opened 62 &#32;new stores in fiscal 2014 , 71 &#32;net new stores in fiscal 2015 , and plan to open approximately 85 &#32;new stores in fiscal 2016 . Our new store model assumes approximately 7,500 &#32;square feet and is primarily in-line locations within power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets. We have a talented and disciplined real estate management team and a rigorous real estate site selection process. We analyze the demographics of the surrounding trade areas and the performance of adjacent retailers, as well as traffic and specific site characteristics and other variables. As of January 30, 2016 , we have executed lease agreements for the opening of 53 &#32;new stores in fiscal 2016 . 

&#8226; 

Drive Comparable Store Sales. We expect to continue generating positive comparable store sales growth by continuing to hone and refine our dynamic merchandising offering and differentiated in-store shopping experience. We intend to increase our brand awareness through cost-effective marketing efforts and enthusiastic customer engagement. We believe that executing on these strategies will increase the size and frequency of purchases by our existing customers and attract new customers to our stores. 

&#8226; 

Increase Brand Awareness. We have a cost-effective marketing strategy designed to drive store traffic and promote brand awareness. Our strategy includes the use of newspaper circulars, television, digital, and grassroots marketing to support existing and new market entries. We leverage our growing e-mail database, mobile website and social media presence to drive brand excitement and increased store visits within existing and new markets. We believe that our digital experience is an extension of our brand and retail stores, serving as a marketing and customer engagement tool for us. Our digital experience allows us to continue to build brand awareness and expand our customer base. 

&#8226; 

Enhance Operating Margins. We believe we have further opportunities to drive margin improvement over time. A primary driver of our expected margin expansion will come from leveraging our cost structure as we continue to increase our store base and drive our average net sales per store. We intend to capitalize on opportunities across our supply chain as we grow our business and achieve further economies of scale. 

Our History 

The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in January 2002 under the name of Cheap Holdings, Inc. by David Schlessinger and Thomas Vellios, who recognized a market need for a fun and affordable shopping destination aimed at our target customer. We changed our name to Five Below, Inc. in August 2002. In July 2014, Joel Anderson joined the Five Below senior management team. In December 2014, Joel Anderson was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Thomas Vellios was appointed as Executive Chairman, both effective February 1, 2015. 

On July 24, 2012, we completed our initial public offering (the "IPO"), of 11,057,692 shares of common stock at a price of $17.00 per share. Subsequent to our IPO, in February, July and September 2013, certain of our shareholders sold 13,012,250 , 6,900,000 &#32;and 7,100,000 &#32;shares of common stock, respectively, in separate secondary public offerings. 

On June 12, 2013, we completed an internal business restructuring pursuant to which we formed Five Below Merchandising, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;), and transferred to the Subsidiary assets, operations and employees related to our merchandising operations (the &#8220;Restructuring&#8221;). Following the Restructuring, the Subsidiary purchases and sells to us certain goods for sale at our retail locations, and we provide to the Subsidiary back office support, office space and other services, in each case, pursuant to agreements between us and the Subsidiary. 

Our Market Opportunity 

As a result of our unique merchandise offering and value proposition, we believe we have effectively tapped the teen and pre-teen markets. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 63 million people in the United States between the ages of 5 and 19, which represented over 20% of the U.S. population as of April 1, 2010. Based on management&#8217;s experience and industry knowledge, we believe that this segment of the population has a significant amount of disposable income as the vast majority of this age group&#8217;s basic needs are already met. 

Our Merchandise 

Strategy 

We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of trend-right, high-quality products, all priced at $5 or below, including select brands and licensed merchandise, targeted at the teen and pre-teen customer. We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a unique merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept that our customers consider fun and exciting. Based on management&#8217;s experience and industry knowledge, we believe our compelling value proposition and the dynamic nature of our merchandise offering has fostered universal appeal to customers across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic. 

Our typical store features in excess of 4,000 stock-keeping units, or SKUs, across a number of our category worlds including Style , Room , Sports , Tech , Crafts , Party, Candy &#32;and Now . We focus our merchandising strategy on maintaining core categories within our stores, but aim to generate high item velocity and sell-through to keep our assortment fresh and drive repeat visits. We monitor trends in our target demographic market, historical sales trends of current and prior products and the success of new product launches to ensure that our merchandise is relevant for our customers. We have a highly planned merchandise strategy focused on trend-right and everyday products supplemented by selected opportunistic purchases from our vendors to drive traffic and therefore offer our customers a consistently exciting shopping experience. 

We believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our core product categories. The common element of our dynamic merchandise selection is the consistent delivery of exceptional value to the consumer, with all products offered at or below the $5 price point. Pricing all items at $5 or below enables us to provide an extensive range of exciting products, while maintaining the attraction of a value retailer. Many of the products we sell can also be found in mall specialty stores, department stores, mass merchandisers and drug stores; however, we offer all of these products in an exciting and easy to shop retail environment at price points of $5 and below.

We organize the merchandise in our stores into the following category worlds:

Our Stores 

As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 437 &#32;stores throughout the Northeast, South and Midwest regions of the United States. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 7,500 &#32;square feet. Our stores are primarily located in power, community and lifestyle shopping centers; approximately 3% &#32;of our stores are located in malls. The following map shows the number of stores in each of the states in which we operated and the locations of our distributions centers as of January 30, 2016 . 

Store Design and Layout 

We present our products in a unique and engaging in-store atmosphere. We maintain a consistent floor layout designed with an easy-to-navigate racetrack flow and featuring sight-lines across the entire store enabling customers to easily identify our category worlds. All of our stores feature a sound system playing popular music throughout the shopping day. We employ novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage, which attract customers, encourage hands-on interaction with our products and convey our value pricing. In addition to traditional perimeter and gondola shelving, racks and tables, we utilize innovative approaches such as wheelbarrows, barrels and bins strategically placed throughout our stores. These techniques foster customer interaction with products, supporting the strong relationship we strive to develop with our customers and enhance our upbeat and vibrant shopping environment. 

Each of our category worlds is strategically located within our stores in an effort to enhance the customer&#8217;s shopping experience. For example, our Now offerings are located in the front of the store with the goal of catching customers&#8217; attention and being &#8220;top of mind,&#8221; and specially featured value items and other key items are positioned along the center aisle. Impulse items and &#8220;dollar value&#8221; tables surround the checkout areas to capture add-on purchases. 

Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection 

Our unique focus on the teen and pre-teen customer is supported by our real estate strategy to locate stores in high-visibility locations. We seek to operate stores in high-visibility, high-traffic retail venues, which reinforce our brand message, heighten brand awareness and drive customer traffic. 

Our strategy is to saturate markets with clusters of stores because of the considerable benefit that stores derive from market concentration. Our store model is profitable across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets and in multiple real estate venues including power, community and lifestyle shopping centers. Our retail concept works well with a large and varied group of national co-tenants that drive customer traffic. 

We select store sites for new store openings based upon certain criteria including minimum population density requirements, availability of attractive lease terms, sufficient space and strong positioning within a center. Members of our real estate team spend considerable time evaluating prospective sites before bringing a proposal to our real estate committee. Our real estate committee, which is composed of senior management including our executive officers, approves all of our locations before a lease is signed. 

We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our store base in the United States. We opened 71 &#32;net new stores in fiscal 2015 &#32;and we intend to open approximately 85 &#32;new stores in fiscal 2016 &#32;through expansion in existing markets and by entering new markets. We maintain a pipeline of real estate sites that have been approved by our real estate committee and have executed 53 &#32;leases through January 30, 2016 &#32;for new stores in fiscal 2016 . Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table:

Opening stores within existing markets enables Five Below to benefit from enhanced brand awareness and to achieve advertising, operating and distribution efficiencies. Our targeted new store openings include additional locations in existing markets as well as expansion into adjacent states and markets. In existing markets, we use a store densification strategy that promotes brand awareness and leverages marketing, operating and distribution costs. When entering new markets, we employ a store clustering strategy, opening multiple stores in a single market on the same day, enabling us to leverage marketing and pre-opening expenses and generate initial new market brand awareness. 

Our store growth is supported by our new store economics, which we believe to be compelling. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 7,500 &#32;square feet that achieves sales of approximately $1.6 million in the first full year of operation and an average new store cash investment of approximately $0.3 million , including our store build-out (net of tenant allowances), inventory (net of payables) and cash pre-opening expenses. Our new store model targets an average payback period of less than one year on our initial investment. 

Store Management, Culture and Training 

Each of our stores is managed by a general manager and one or two assistant managers who oversee full-time and part-time team members within each store. Each general manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of his or her store, including the unit&#8217;s operating results, maintaining a clean and appealing store environment and the hiring, training and development of personnel. We also employ regional managers who are responsible for overseeing the operations of our district managers. Our district managers are responsible for overseeing the operations of 10 to 15 stores, on average. 

We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes strong sales performance and customer service, allowing us to identify and reward team members who meet our high performance standards. Store managers and assistant managers participate in a rewarding bonus incentive program. We also recognize individual performance through internal promotions and provide extensive opportunities for advancement. 

Our employees are critical to achieving our goals, and we strive to hire talented employees with high energy levels and motivation. We have well-established store operating policies and procedures and an in-store training program for new store managers, assistant managers and staff. In addition, we have a dedicated group of training and new store opening managers who are focused on ensuring a consistent new store opening process and who leverage their extensive experience and 

knowledge of the Five Below culture to train new store managers. Our customer service and store procedure training programs are designed to enable associates to assist customers in a friendly manner and to help to create a positive sales-driven environment and culture as well as teach successful operating practices and procedures. 

Merchandising, Sourcing and Distribution 

We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. 

Merchandising 

Our merchandising team consists of an Executive Vice President, Merchandising, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, and is supported by an extensive team of merchandising personnel. Our merchandising team works directly with our product development team and our central planning and allocation group to ensure a consistent delivery of products across our store base. Our Executive Vice President, Merchandising has over 30 years of experience within the retail sector. 

Our product development team is led by a Senior Vice President of Business and Product Development. Our product development team works directly with our merchandising group to identify new and improved products through international sourcing. Our Senior Vice President of Business and Product Development has over 30 years of experience within the retail sector. 

Sourcing 

We believe we have strong sourcing capabilities developed through a dynamic and collaborative relationship with our vendor partners that provide us with favorable access to quality merchandise at attractive prices. We regularly purchase core merchandise in accordance with our key categories. We also employ an opportunistic buying strategy, capitalizing on selected excess inventory opportunities, to purchase complementary merchandise based on consumer trends, product availability and favorable economic terms. 

We work with approximately 800 &#32;active vendors, with no single vendor representing more than 7% &#32;of our purchases in fiscal 2015 . We sourced approximately 67% &#32;of our purchases from domestic vendors in fiscal 2015 . We typically have no long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with our vendors. 

Distribution 

We distribute over 85% &#32;of our merchandise from our 700,000 square foot distribution center in Pedricktown, New Jersey and our 605,000 square foot distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, with the remaining merchandise shipped directly from the vendor to our stores. We realize cost savings by working with our vendors to streamline and reduce packaging to diminish shipping costs. 

We generally ship merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores between two and four times a week, depending on the season and the volume of a specific store. We use contract carriers to ship merchandise to our stores. From time to time, we augment our distribution facilities with third-party warehousing. 

We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing distribution facilities and evaluate opportunities for additional distribution centers. In July 2014, we signed a lease for a new distribution center in Pedricktown, New Jersey to support our anticipated growth. We took possession of the new distribution center in June 2015. We currently occupy approximately 700,000 square feet and will expand to approximately one million square feet by 2019. The lease agreement, which began in fiscal 2015, will expire in 2025 with options to renew for three successive five-year periods. 

Marketing and Advertising 

Our cost-effective marketing strategy is designed to drive store traffic and increase brand awareness with our target demographic, as well as other value-oriented customers. Our strategy includes the use of newspaper, television, digital, mobile/social and digital circulars during peak selling seasons that highlight our brand and exceptional value proposition as well as grassroots marketing to support existing and new market entries. Additionally, we rely on the strong visibility and the presence of our store locations, email messaging and community fundraising to promote and further our brand image and drive traffic. Our digital experience, anchored by our mobile and social media presence is growing rapidly as we utilize Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter to engage our customers with compelling digital content on a daily basis. 

Our marketing team works with our merchandising team to develop novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage, which attract customers, encourage hands-on interaction with our products and convey our value pricing. 

For new store openings, we seek to create community awareness and consumer excitement through a mix of print advertising, digital, mobile/social, public relations and community outreach promoting the grand opening and by creating an engaging grand opening event that includes contests, giveaways and signature &#8220;Five Cent&#8221; hot dogs. We also aim to execute multiple store openings in a given new market on the same day in order to leverage marketing efforts to produce maximum impact. 

In addition to our marketing and public relations efforts described above, we also maintain a website ( www.fivebelow.com ) and, over the last year, our online following has grown substantially. We use both our website and social networking sites to highlight our featured products, value proposition, store locations, employment opportunities, and grand openings. 

Competition 

We compete with a broad range of retailers including discount, mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores with both physical locations and online stores. Many of these retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. We also compete with 

online retailers who do not have traditional brick and mortar locations. 

The principal basis upon which we compete is by offering a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, all priced at $5 or below and including select brands and licensed merchandise, targeted at the teen and pre-teen customer. We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a unique merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept that our customers consider fun and exciting. Our success also depends in substantial part on our ability to respond quickly to trends so that we can meet the changing demands of our customers. We believe that we compare favorably relative to many of our competitors based on our merchandising strategy, edited product assortment targeted at teens and pre-teens, store environment, flexible real estate strategy and company culture. Nonetheless, certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. 

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

We own several trademarks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including Five Below &#174; &#32;and Five Below Hot Stuff. Cool Prices &#174; . We also own domain names, including www.fivebelow.com , and unregistered copyrights in our website content. We attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and pursue any infringement of those marks. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this document may appear without the &#174; or &#8482; symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. We also refer to product names, trademarks, trade names and service marks that are the property of other companies. 

Management Information Systems 

Our management information systems provide a full range of business process assistance and timely information to support our merchandising strategy, warehouse management, stores and operating and financial teams. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to merchandising and operating trends in our business. We use a combination of internal and external resources to support store point-of-sale, merchandise planning and buying, inventory management, financial reporting, real estate and administrative functions. We continuously assess ways to maximize productivity and efficiency, as well as, evaluate opportunities to further enhance our existing systems. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 

Insurance 

We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including but not limited to workers&#8217; compensation, cyber, directors &#38; officers, general liability, property and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 1,500 &#32;full-time and 6,100 &#32;part-time personnel. Of our total employees, approximately 200 &#32;were based at our corporate headquarters in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, approximately 200 &#32;were based at our distribution centers in Pedricktown, New Jersey and Olive Branch, Mississippi and approximately 7,200 &#32;were store employees. The number of part-time associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. None of our employees belong to a union or are party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement. 

Seasonality 

Our business is seasonal in nature with the highest level of net sales and net income generated in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
