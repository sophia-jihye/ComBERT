 Item 1. Business Overview 

Intevac&#146;s business consists of two reportable segments: 

Thin-film Equipment: Intevac is a leader in the design and development of high-productivity, thin-film processing systems. Our production-proven platforms are designed for high-volume manufacturing of substrates with precise thin-film properties, such as the hard drive media, display cover panel (&#147;DCP&#148;), and solar photovoltaic (&#147;PV&#148;) markets we serve currently. 

Photonics: Intevac is a leading developer of advanced high-sensitivity digital sensors, cameras and systems that primarily serve the defense industry. We are the provider of integrated digital night vision imaging systems for the U.S. military. 

Intevac was incorporated in California in October 1990 and was reincorporated in Delaware in 2007. 

&#160;

Thin-film Equipment Segment 

Hard Disk Drive Equipment Market 

Intevac designs, manufactures, markets and services complex capital equipment used to deposit thin films and lubricants onto substrates to produce magnetic disks that are used in hard disk drives. Disk and disk drive manufacturers produce magnetic disks in a sophisticated manufacturing process involving many steps, including plating, annealing, polishing, texturing, sputtering, etching, stripping and lubrication. Intevac believes its systems represent approximately 60% of the installed capacity for disk sputtering worldwide. Intevac&#146;s systems are used by manufacturers of magnetic media such as Seagate Technology, Western Digital, including its wholly-owned subsidiary HGST, Fuji Electric, and Showa Denko. 

Hard disk drives are a primary storage medium for digital data including nearline &#147;cloud&#148; applications and are used in products and applications such as personal computers (&#147;PCs&#148;), enterprise data storage, video players and video game consoles. Intevac believes that hard disk drive media shipments will continue to grow over time, driven by continued high growth rates in digitally-stored data, by the slowing of areal density improvements, by the increase in demand for nearline drives for cloud storage, an increasing tie ratio (for the average number of hard disks per drive) and by new and emerging applications. In the hard drive industry, the projected growth rates for digitally-stored data exceed the rate of areal density improvements, at the same time as the tie ratio is increasing, which results in demand for magnetic disks outpacing hard disk drive units. 

In recent years the hard disk drive business has been negatively impacted by declining PC units, primarily caused as a result of the proliferation of tablets, the transition to centralized storage, and the effects of uncertain macro-economic environment conditions on demand for PCs from consumers and corporations. Although the hard drive industry continues to expect growth in the enterprise data storage market segment, the transition to centralized storage combined with the negative growth in PC shipments has resulted in lower hard drive shipments in recent years. However, Intevac continues to believe that long-term demand for hard disks required for high capacity hard disk drives will increase, driven by growth in demand for digital storage, declining growth rate in areal density improvements, and increased information technology spending to support the transition to cloud storage. The number of disk manufacturing systems needed to support this growth as well as future technology transitions and improvements is expected to vary from year to year depending on the factors noted above. 

Intevac expects that hard disk drive manufacturers will extend their utilization of planar perpendicular media with the introduction of Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (&#147;HAMR&#148;) expected within the next two to three years. The first HAMR-based hard disk drives are expected to ship to the marketplace in late 2016. Intevac believes that the leading manufacturers of magnetic media are using Intevac Systems for HAMR development, creating a significant market opportunity as HAMR is more widely adopted. Significant market penetration of HAMR-based hard disk drives is expected to occur by 2018. Intevac believes that the transition to HAMR will require disk manufacturers to upgrade their installed base of equipment, which would result in increased demand for equipment technology upgrades to be performed by Intevac. 

Solar Market 

Intevac designs, manufactures and markets capital equipment for the PV solar manufacturing industry. 

A solar cell (also called a PV cell) is a solid state device that converts the energy of sunlight directly into electricity. Assemblies of cells are used to make solar modules, also known as solar panels. Solar panels have broad-based end market applications for utility-scale solar farms; integrated building PV arrays for commercial, retail, and offices; residential rooftop; and for portable devices. 

The cost of electricity generated from solar energy, in many cases, remains higher than that of electricity generated from traditional energy sources. However, deployment of photovoltaics is gaining momentum on a worldwide scale, particularly in Asia, North America and other regions, where solar PV is now increasingly 

&#160;

competitive with conventional energy sources. Grid parity, whereby solar PV generates power at a levelized cost of electricity (&#147;LCOE&#148;) less than or equal to the price of power purchased from the electrical grid, has already been reached in about thirty countries. In countries or areas where the cost of solar energy generation remains higher than traditional electricity generation sources, some governments have implemented various tax credits and other financial incentives to promote the growth in solar and in other alternative energy sources. As a result of solar energy costs having favorably declined due to the increased scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies spurred by these incentive policies, many governments have reduced or are planning to reduce their incentives for solar, a trend which is likely to continue. However, the United States Investment Tax Credit (&#147;ITC&#148;) for solar which was due to expire by the end of 2016, has been extended to continue the proliferation of solar generated energy. As of the beginning of 2015 fourteen U.S. states have reached grid parity, and an additional fourteen more are poised to reach grid parity within this decade. 

At the end of 2015, solar amounted to 1% of worldwide electricity generation capacity. For newly added electrical power generation, the mix is quite different; in 2014, fifteen percent of newly added global energy generation was solar, and solar is forecast to increase to as much as 20% of newly added generation capacity by 2017. On a gigawatt basis, the yearly market for solar energy is expected to grow from 59 gigawatts of solar added in 2015 to over 70 gigawatts added in 2019. 2015 also saw manufacturing capacity for the production of solar cells coming into parity with end market demand, ameliorating recent supply-demand imbalances, and resulting in selected new capacity additions being initiated by the PV industry in anticipation of projected future demand for its products. 

The PV industry continues to focus on the development of high-efficiency cell technologies aimed at simultaneously boosting PV efficiency and reducing solar energy production costs. New vacuum process technologies and integrated processing steps are expected to become increasingly important as companies search for lower-cost manufacturing solutions for PV cells. 

Intevac offers products for wafer-based crystalline silicon (&#147;c-Si&#148;) solar cell manufacturing processes, the prevailing manufacturing process in the PV industry. Intevac&#146;s products for the solar industry are specifically focused on cell designs with the highest energy conversion efficiency, which are based within the n-type mono crystalline portion of the market. 

Intevac offers thin-film vacuum process manufacturing solutions for c-Si cell fabrication applications. Intevac offers high-productivity process equipment solutions that enable low-cost solar cell manufacturing with high cell efficiency, consistent with the PV industry&#146;s focus and requirements. Intevac has developed two vacuum process application technologies for solar cell manufacturing: one utilizes Physical Vapor Deposition (&#147;PVD&#148;) technology for the deposition of thin films onto c-Si wafers, and the other utilizes ion implantation, which selectively changes the electrical characteristics of the c-Si solar cell. 

PVD is a process used in multiple ways in the manufacturing of solar cells such as for fabricating electrical contacts and conductor layers, depositing reflective layers of various types, and for growing transparent conductive oxide layers, all of which are critical to the efficiency of solar cells. 

Ion implantation is a solar cell processing technology whereby an impurity is added to a PV structure to improve its conductivity. In ion implantation, a beam of ions of a desired dopant element such as phosphorus or boron is electrostatically accelerated and directed toward the target material, introducing the impurity. In a subsequent thermal annealing step, the dopant is electrically activated. The ion implant processes enable precision engineering of the dose and of the depth of dopant elements to form emitter structures in working solar cells. Ion implantation is a technique being introduced to solar cell lines as a means to lower the cost per watt to manufacture the cell. Ion implantation can replace existing diffusion processes in existing solar processing lines for present-day PV cell structures, and is also extendable to new advanced cell structures. In both cases, ion implant-formed emitters are created with fewer processing steps, and therefore at lower cost, than the diffusion processes implant displaces. Intevac&#146;s ion implantation products are based upon technology developed by Solar Implant Technologies, Inc. (&#147;SIT&#148;) which was acquired by Intevac in November 2010. 

&#160;

Display Cover Panel (&#147;DCP&#148;) Market 

Intevac develops equipment to deposit optically transparent thin-films onto DCPs typically found on consumer and automotive electronic products. 

DCPs are found in products including smartphones, tablet PCs, wearable devices, gaming systems, digital cameras, automotive infotainment systems and digital signage. In 2015, approximately 1.4 billion mobile phones, 235 million tablet PCs and 72 million wearable devices were shipped to consumers worldwide. For smartphones alone, it is forecasted that nearly 2 billion units will ship by 2020, representing a CAGR of greater than 7% for the 2015 &#150; 2020 time period. 

The DCP is typically made of tempered glass, such as soda-lime or aluminosilicate, or other materials such as sapphire. The primary function of the DCP is to provide a clear protective interface to the display it protects. In many cases, the DCP is treated with various coatings to enhance its protective performance as well as for clarity, readability and touch sensitivity. 

The types of coatings typically found on DCPs of electronic devices include: Scratch Protection (&#147;SP&#148;) coatings, Anti-Reflection (&#147;AR&#148;) coatings, and Anti-Finger (&#147;AF&#148;) coatings. 

SP coatings generally consist of hard thin-films deposited onto the surface of the DCP. Their primary function is to provide enhanced protection against the incidence of scratch, but they can also provide greater breakage resistance. SP coatings are gaining in popularity. SP coatings also improve the readability of displays. 

AR coatings enable greater light transmission though the DCP by reducing the light reflected by the surface back to the user&#146;s eye. This allows the user to more easily read the display and reduces the required power needed to display the image which results in extending the battery life. A significant drawback to using AR coatings is their susceptibility to scratch. AR coatings are typically soft and applied to the surface of the DCP. These coatings generally scratch easily. 

AF coatings provide water and oil protection for the surface of the DCP. This coating which prevents fingerprints provides greater aesthetics as well as improving readability. AF coatings allow for greater visual acuity when fingerprints are not visible. The drawback to AF coatings is their relatively low resistance to wear. The coating is soft and usually wears off within a few months of product purchase. 

Intevac has developed and is currently marketing a SP coating known as Optical Diamond-like-Carbon (&#147;oDLC&#148;). This coating provides a hard protective layer which significantly improves the DCP&#146;s resistance to scratches and breakage. 

Thin-Film Equipment Products 

Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment product portfolio addressing each of these markets is based around common core technologies and competencies. Intevac believes its Thin-film Equipment product portfolio can be extended to support adjacent markets. Based on its history and market and technology leadership in the hard disk drive industry, Intevac offers superior high-productivity vacuum handling of small substrates at the lowest cost of ownership. Lowest cost of ownership includes various advantages such as high target utilization, high throughput, small footprint, double-sided coating, and reduced materials costs.

* Less than 10% &#160;

Intevac expects that sales of Intevac&#146;s products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of Intevac&#146;s revenues in the foreseeable future. 

Foreign sales accounted for 35% of revenue in fiscal 2015, 21% of revenue in fiscal 2014, and 53% of revenue in fiscal 2013. The majority of Intevac&#146;s foreign sales are to companies in Asia or to U.S. companies for use in their Asian manufacturing or development operations. Intevac anticipates that foreign sales will continue to be a significant portion of Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment revenues. Intevac&#146;s disk sputtering equipment customers include magnetic disk manufacturers, such as Fuji Electric and Showa Denko, and vertically integrated hard disk drive manufacturers, such as Seagate, Western Digital and HGST. Intevac&#146;s customers&#146; manufacturing facilities are primarily located in California, China, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. 

Competition 

The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for Intevac Thin-film Equipment products include price, product performance and functionality, ease of integration, customer support and service, reputation and reliability. Intevac has one major competitor, Canon Anelva, in the hard disk drive equipment market and has historically experienced intense worldwide competition for magnetic disk sputtering equipment. Intevac primarily faces competition from large established global competitors in the PV equipment market including Applied Materials, Centrotherm Photovoltaics, Amtech, Jusung and Von Ardenne. Intevac faces competition in the DCP market from glass manufacturers that may develop scratch resistant glass, from touchscreen manufacturers that may adopt harder substrate materials, or from other equipment companies, chemical companies or the display cover plate manufacturers themselves that may offer competing protective coatings including oDLC. These competitors generally have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and other resources as compared to Intevac. Furthermore, any of Intevac&#146;s competitors may develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that offer superior price or performance features. In addition, new competitors, with enhanced products may enter the markets that Intevac currently serves. 

The principal competitive factors affecting Photonics products include price, extreme low-light level detection performance, power consumption, resolution, size, ease of integration, reliability, reputation and customer support and service. Intevac faces substantial competition for Photonics products, and many competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition. In the military market, Harris Corporation and L-3 Communications are large and well-established defense contractors and are the primary U.S. manufacturers of analog image intensifier tubes used in Generation-III night vision devices and their derivative products. Intevac expects that other companies will develop digital night vision products and aggressively promote their sales. Furthermore, Intevac&#146;s LIVAR target identification sensors and cameras face competition from CMC Electronics, DRS Technologies, FLIR Systems, Goodrich and Raytheon, established companies that manufacture infrared sensors and cameras which are presently used in long-range target identification systems. Within the near-eye display market, Intevac also faces competition from Rockwell-Collins and Vuzix, both of which can offer cost-competitive products. 

Marketing and Sales 

Thin-film Equipment sales are made primarily through Intevac&#146;s direct sales force. Intevac also sells its products through distributors in Japan and China. The selling process for Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment products is multi-level and lengthy, involving individuals from marketing, engineering, operations, customer service and senior management. 

Installing and integrating new equipment requires a substantial investment by a customer. Sales of Intevac&#146;s systems depend, in significant part, upon the decision of a prospective customer to replace obsolete equipment or to increase manufacturing capacity by upgrading or expanding existing manufacturing facilities or by constructing new manufacturing facilities, all of which typically involve a significant capital commitment. Intevac&#146;s systems have a lengthy sales cycle, during which Intevac may expend substantial funds and management time and effort with no assurance that a sale will result. 

&#160;

The production of large complex systems requires Intevac to make significant investments in inventory both to fulfill customer orders and to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts to service previously shipped systems. Intevac maintains inventories of spare parts in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and China to support its Thin-film Equipment customers. Intevac often requires its Thin-film Equipment customers to pay for systems in three installments, with a portion of the system price billed upon receipt of an order, a portion of the price billed upon shipment, and the balance of the price and any sales tax due upon completion of installation and acceptance of the system at the customer&#146;s factory. 

Intevac provides process and applications support, customer training, installation, start-up assistance and post-installation service support to Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment customers. Intevac has field offices in Singapore, China, and Malaysia to support Intevac&#146;s customers in Asia. 

Warranties for Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment products typically range between 12 and 24 months from customer acceptance. During the warranty period any necessary non-consumable parts are supplied and installed without charge. 

Sales of Photonics products for military applications are primarily made to the end user through Intevac&#146;s direct sales force. Intevac sells to the U.S. government and to leading defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon, DRS Technologies, BAE and Sagem. 

Intevac is subject to long sales cycles in the Photonics segment because many of Intevac&#146;s products, such as Intevac&#146;s night vision systems, typically must be designed into Intevac&#146;s customers&#146; products, which are often complex and state-of-the-art. These development cycles are generally multi-year, and Intevac&#146;s sales are dependent on Intevac&#146;s customer successfully integrating Intevac&#146;s product into its product, completing development of its product and then obtaining production orders for its product. Sales of these products are also often dependent on ongoing funding of defense programs by the U.S. government and its allies. Additionally, sales to international customers are contingent on issuance of export licenses by the U.S. government. 

Sales of Raman spectroscopy instruments were made through a combination of direct sales, distributors and value added resellers. 

Photonics generally invoices its research and development customers either as costs are incurred, or as program milestones are achieved, depending upon the particular contract terms. As a government contractor, Intevac invoices customers using estimated annual rates approved by the Defense Contracts Audit Agency (&#147;DCAA&#148;). 

Research and Development and Intellectual Property 

Intevac&#146;s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new products. Intevac works closely with Intevac&#146;s customers to design products that meet their planned technical and production requirements. Product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States and Singapore. 

Intevac invested $15.7 million (20.8% of net revenue) in fiscal 2015, $15.8 million (24.2% of net revenue) in fiscal 2014, and $21.0 million (30.2% of net revenues) in fiscal 2013 for product development and engineering programs to create new products and to improve existing technologies and products. Intevac has spent an average of 31.5% of net revenues on product development and engineering over the last five years. 

Intevac&#146;s competitive position significantly depends on Intevac&#146;s research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and not just on Intevac&#146;s patent position. However, protection of Intevac&#146;s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents, is important. Therefore, Intevac&#146;s practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that Intevac considers important. Intevac has patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although Intevac does not consider Intevac&#146;s business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Intevac and the products made and sold under Intevac&#146;s 

&#160;

patents along with other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and copyrights, taken as a whole, are a significant element of Intevac&#146;s business. 

Intevac enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in Intevac&#146;s best interest to do so. Intevac pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for use of certain patented technologies in several of Intevac&#146;s products. Intevac also receives, from time to time, royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been material to Intevac&#146;s consolidated results of operations. 

In the normal course of business, Intevac periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringements. In dealing with such inquiries, it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Intevac is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses and/or successfully prosecute or defend Intevac&#146;s position, Intevac&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Manufacturing 

Intevac manufactures its Thin-film Equipment products at its facilities in California and Singapore. Intevac&#146;s Thin-film Equipment manufacturing operations include electromechanical assembly, vacuum processing, fabrication of sputter sources, and system assembly, alignment and testing. 

Photonics products are manufactured at Intevac&#146;s facilities in California. Photonics manufactures sensors, cameras, integrated camera systems, and near-eye display systems using advanced manufacturing techniques and equipment. Intevac&#146;s operations include vacuum processing, and electromechanical and optical system assembly. 

Employees 

At January 2, 2016, Intevac had 281 employees, including 22 contract employees. 

Compliance with Environmental Regulations 

Intevac is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, treatment and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous substances, chemicals, materials or waste. Intevac treats the cost of complying with government regulations and operating a safe workplace as a normal cost of business and allocates the cost of these activities to all functions, except where the cost can be isolated and charged to a specific function. The environmental standards and regulations promulgated by government agencies in California and Singapore are rigorous and set a high standard of compliance. Intevac believes its costs of compliance with these regulations and standards are comparable to other companies operating similar facilities in these jurisdictions.
