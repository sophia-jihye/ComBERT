BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

BACKGROUND 

&#160; 

Global Equity International Inc. (&#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;GEI&#8221;)) was incorporated on October 1, 2010, as a Nevada corporation, for the express purpose of acquiring Global Equity Partners Plc, a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles (&#8220;GEP&#8221;) on September 2, 2009. On August 22, 2014, GE Professionals DMCC was incorporated in Dubai as a fully owned subsidiary of Global Equity Partners Plc. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Global Equity Partners Plc and its subsidiary GE Professionals DMCC are Dubai based firms that provide consulting services, such as corporate restructuring, advice on management buy outs, management recruitment and development for corporate marketing, investor and public relations, regulatory compliance and introductions to financiers, to companies desiring to be listed on stock exchanges in various parts of the world. 

&#160; 

Our authorized capital consists of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value. 

&#160; 

On November 15, 2010, we entered into a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization (&#8220;Plan of Reorganization&#8221;) with GEP and its sole shareholder, Peter J. Smith, pursuant to which we would acquire 100% of the common stock of GEP. We consummated the Plan of Reorganization effective December 31, 2010, by issuing 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to Peter J. Smith, at which time GEP became our wholly owned subsidiary and Peter J. Smith was appointed as our President, Chief Executive Officer and Director. 

&#160; 

As a result of our acquisition of GEP, we provide corporate advisory services to companies desiring to have their shares listed on stock exchanges or quoted on quotation bureaus in various parts of the world. We have offices in Dubai and London. We have affiliations with firms located in some of the world&#8217;s leading financial centers such as London, New York, Frankfurt and Dubai. These affiliations are informal and are comprised of personal relationships with groups of people or people with whom our Company or our management has done, or attempted to do, business in the past. We do not have any contractual arrangements, written or otherwise, with our affiliations.

&#160; 

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY 

&#160; 

As a Company with less than $1 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (also known as the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). As an emerging growth company, we are entitled to take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; disclosure; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Not having to obtain non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. &#160; 

We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenues, if we have more than $700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates, or if we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens in the future. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. 

&#160; 

Peter Smith initially founded Global Equity Partners Plc. in 2009 to assist small to medium size businesses with management restructuring and corporate restructuring, in general, and also to obtain, if requested by its clients, access to capital markets via equity and debt financings. 

&#160; 

Global Equity Partners Plc. and its subsidiary GE Professionals DMCC look for companies that require capital funding and ultimately a listing of their shares on a recognized stock exchange. The Company introduces these clients to private and institutional investors in our network of over 100 &#8220;financial introducers&#8221; around the world. These financial introducers are groups of people or institutions that are presently introducing new clients to us or who have introduced new clients to our management in the past. We do not have any contractual arrangements, written or otherwise, with these financial introducers. 

&#160; 

Presently, Global Equity Partners Plc and its Dubai subsidiary, GE Professionals DMCC, are our only operating businesses. GEI&#180;s present operations are limited to insuring compliance with regional, state and national securities regulatory agencies and organizations. In addition, GEI is charged with (i) handling our periodic reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (ii) managing our investor relations; and (iii) raising debt and equity capital necessary to fund our operations, and to enhance, and grow our business. GEI does not offer or conduct any consulting or advisory services, as such services are performed solely by our foreign subsidiary, GEP. 

&#160; 

We currently offer the following services to our clients: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Corporate restructuring &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Management buy outs &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Management recruitment and employment placements

We also review and analyze their balance sheets and capital structures and make recommendations on debt consolidations, equity exchanges for debt, proper capital structures and viability and timing of equity and debt offerings.

&#160; 

MANAGEMENT BUY OUTS 

&#160; 

We assist our clients in every aspect of management buyouts from corporate restructuring to debt financing and also introduce buyers and sellers to financiers for private equity placements. 

&#160; 

MANAGEMENT RECRUITING AND EMPLOYMENT PLACEMENTS 

&#160; 

We assist our clients with the recruitment of management and board members through our various contacts around the world. Management recruitment and retention is also an important part of our Corporate Restructuring Services and these services often overlap. 

&#160; 

INVESTOR AND PUBLIC RELATIONS 

&#160; 

Since our clients and future clients will likely desire to have their shares listed or continue to be listed on a stock exchange or quoted on one of the quotation bureaus, we will advise our clients on the necessary requirements for communicating with their equity holders and stakeholders, their customers and potential customers. We will assist our clients in this area by recommending third party financial professionals and investor relations and public relations organizations to provide them with such services. 

&#160; 

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 

&#160; 

We have organized a cadre of third party securities attorneys and accountants to assist our clients with their compliance with the many reporting and other requirements of stock exchanges, quotation bureaus and securities regulatory agencies and organizations in the states and countries where their shares will be or are listed or traded. 

&#160; 

EXCHANGE LISTINGS 

&#160; 

We also assist our clients with the selection of stock exchanges that may be suitable to our clients. Various exchanges have listing requirements and standards that vary from one exchange to another. Typical listing requirements and standards relate to a number of things, such as pre-tax income, cash flows, revenue, net tangible assets, market value of a company&#8217;s listed securities, minimum trading prices of a company&#8217;s securities, minimum shareholders&#8217; equity, operating history, number of shareholders, number of market makers, and corporate governance. We will try to identify appropriate exchanges for our clients based on the particular client&#8217;s operating history, pre-tax income, cash flow, revenue, net tangible assets, shareholder base and other factors described above. 

&#160; 

We will assist our clients with retention of attorneys and accountants having experience with publicly held companies and stock exchanges in various countries. We will also assist our clients in locating market makers, investment bankers and broker-dealers to assist them with accessing capital markets. 

&#160; 

INTRODUCTIONS TO FINANCIERS 

&#160; 

After reviewing the business plans, prospects and problems that are unique to each of our clients, we will use our best efforts to introduce our clients to various third party financial resources around the world who may be able to assist them with their capital funding requirements.

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 1) DEVELOP THE INTRODUCER NETWORK FURTHER AND IN HOPES OF ATTRACTING NEW INTEREST FOR OUR SERVICES. &#160; 

We currently are relying on introductions to potential clients by the following firms in the Middle East, South East Asia, Europe and the US: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Certain registered investment houses and funds in London (United Kingdom) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; An Austrian management consultancy firm based in Vienna (Austria) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Various investment banks based in Dubai (UAE) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Certain Private Banks based in Amsterdam (Holland), Luxembourg (Luxembourg) and Zurich in Switzerland &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Various family offices in Dubai (UAE) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Various introducers to Capital based on the East and West coast of the US &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Various introducers to Capital based in South East Asia &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Yemon (Pvt.)

We intend to develop relationships with a further six &#8220;introducers&#8221; to potential new business for the Company within the next 12 months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2) NEW BUSINESS &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 3) DUBAI EXPANSION &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 4) SOUTH EAST ASIAN EXPANSION &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 6) EXPAND OUR CONSULTANCY TO INCLUDE MORE MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY. &#160; 

We intend to form relationships with merger and acquisition specialists during the next 12 months, which will hopefully enable us to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Find potential merger and acquisition candidates. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Introduce our clients to brokers and investment bankers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Introduce our clients to the appropriate professionals (attorneys and accountants) to assist them in a public offering or exchange listing. &#160; 

&#160; 7) DEVELOP IN HOUSE IT DEPARTMENT &#160; 

Commencing initially with one member we will start to develop a proprietary program allowing us to easily monitor a client&#8217;s development status and work in progress. We will also use this tool to manage our pipeline of clients and therefore it will become vital in our cash flow forecasting. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8) EXPAND OUR HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT IN DUBAI &#8211; KINGSMAN JAMES. &#160; 

The Company created an in-house human resources department called &#8220;Kingsman James&#8221; ( http://kingsmanjames.com/ ) with a view to be able to provide its existing clients and other new clients with the possibility of restructuring their companies management with seasoned professionals, if required.

Accountants, lawyers and finance professionals are the target market for overlaying our service into their existing client banks in return for a percentage of fees received. We also intend to add at least two new members to our administration team during the next 12 months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11) ROAD SHOWS &#160; 

We will continue working on different &#8220;Road shows&#8221; in Dubai, Europe, South East Asia and the US. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12) FURTHER EXPAND OUR RANGE OF BUSINESS AND CONTACTS &#160;

To service the clients generated from these markets, we will spend time creating a network of service companies who we can utilize to assist us on a local basis. We will explore the possibilities of dual listings for our clients in Singapore to allow us a local market for any Asian clients we will attract and giving the Company a firm foothold in the Asian territory. 

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

We face intense competition in every aspect of our business, and particularly from other firms which offer management, compliance and other consulting services to private and public companies. We would prefer to accept a relatively low cash component as our fee for management consulting and regulatory compliance services and take a greater portion of our fee in the form of restricted shares of our private clients&#8217; common stock. We also face competition from a large number of consulting firms, investment banks, venture capitalists, merchant banks, financial advisors and other management consulting and regulatory compliance services firms similar to ours. Many of our competitors have greater financial and management resources and some have greater market recognition than we do. 

&#160; 

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. 

&#160; 

We are not required to obtain any special licenses, nor meet any special regulatory requirements before establishing our business, other than a simple business license. If new government regulations, laws, or licensing requirements are passed that would restrict or eliminate delivery of any of our intended products, then our business may suffer. Presently, to the best of our knowledge, no such regulations, laws, or licensing requirements exist or are likely to be implemented in the near future that would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on or sales, revenues, or income from our business operations. 

&#160; 

We are not a broker-dealer. We are not an investment adviser or an investment company. We are not a hedge fund or a mutual fund or any similar type of fund. We are primarily an operating business that offers and performs corporate consultancy services. 

&#160; 

EFFECT OF EXISTING OR PROBABLE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;1934 Act&#8221;). As a result of such registration, the Company is subject to Regulation 14A of the &#8220;1934 Act,&#8221; which regulates proxy solicitations. Section 14(a) requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) thereof to comply with the rules and regulations of the Commission regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders of the Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require the Company to provide its stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the Commission at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to stockholders. 

&#160; 

The Company is also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Commission on a regular basis, and will be required to disclose certain events in a timely manner, (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

&#160; 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY COMPLY WITH SECTION 404 OR IF THE COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE ARE SIGNIFICANT, OUR PROFITABILITY, STOCK PRICE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. 

&#160; 

The Company is required to comply with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires that we document and test our internal controls and certify that we are responsible for maintaining an adequate system of internal control procedures for the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years. We are currently evaluating our existing controls against the standards adopted by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). During the course of our ongoing evaluation and integration of the internal controls of our business, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review (see Item 9A, below for a discussion of our internal controls and procedures). 

&#160; 

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations, our results of operations and the future filings of our Company could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

DEPENDENCE ON KEY EMPLOYEES. 

&#160; 

The Company is heavily dependent on the ability of our President, Peter Smith, our Chief Financial Officer, Enzo Taddei and our New Business Managing Director, Patrick V. Dolan. The loss of the services of Mr. Smith, Mr. Taddei or Mr. Dolan would seriously undermine our ability to carry out our business plan. 

&#160; 

In the event of future growth in administration, marketing, manufacturing and customer support functions, the Company may have to increase the depth and experience of its management team by adding new members. The Company&#8217;s success will depend to a large degree upon the active participation of its key officers and employees, as well as the continued service of its key management personnel and its ability to identify, hire, and retain additional qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recruit such qualified personnel to enable it to conduct its proposed business successfully.
