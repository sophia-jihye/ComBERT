 ITEM 1. &#160; &#32; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 

&#160; 

Northwest Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated in September 2009 to be the successor corporation to Northwest Bancorp, Inc., the former stock holding company for Northwest Bank, upon completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Northwest Bancorp, MHC. The terms &#8220;Northwest&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 

&#160; 

The conversion was completed December 18, 2009 when the Company sold 68,878,267 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the related offering. Concurrent with the completion of the offering, shares of Northwest Bancorp, Inc. common stock owned by public stockholders were exchanged for 2.25 shares of Northwest Bancshares, Inc.&#8217;s common stock. We also issued 1,277,565 shares of common stock and contributed $1.0 million in cash from the offering proceeds to Northwest Charitable Foundation, a charitable foundation that we established for the benefit of the communities in which Northwest Bank operates. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 101,871,737 shares outstanding and a market capitalization of approximately $1.346 billion. 

&#160; 

On August 14, 2015, we acquired LNB Bancorp, Inc. ("LNB"), the parent company of The Lorain National Bank, for total consideration of $181.0 million, and thereby acquired LNB&#8217;s 21 branch locations in the counties of Lorain, Cuyahoga and Summit in northeastern Ohio. We acquired assets with a fair value of $1.211 billion, including investment securities with a fair value of $184.2 million, loans with a fair value of $928.1 million, and we assumed deposits of $1.034 billion and borrowings of $63.2 million. The acquisition of LNB enables us to expand our northeastern Ohio presence, improve our core deposit base, and add additional scale in our banking operations. The result of LNB&#8217;s operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of LNB stock was converted into the right to receive either 1.461 shares of common stock of the Company, or $18.70 in cash. As a result, LNB stockholders received 7,056,074 shares of Company common stock, valued at $90.6 million, based on the $12.84 closing price of the Company&#8217;s stock on August 14, 2015, and cash consideration of $90.4 million.

&#160; 

Market Area and Competition 

&#160; 

We are headquartered in Warren, Pennsylvania, which is located in northwestern Pennsylvania, and have our highest concentration of deposits and loans in this area. Since the early 1990s, we have expanded, primarily through acquisitions, into the southwestern and central regions of Pennsylvania, as well as western New York, northeastern Ohio and Maryland. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 133 community banking locations and 51 consumer finance offices in Pennsylvania, 25 community banking offices in Ohio, 19 community banking offices in New York and four community banking offices in Maryland. All of the aforementioned market areas are served by a number of competing financial institutions. As a result, we encounter strong competition both in attracting deposits and in originating personal and business loans. Our most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, brokerage houses, other thrift institutions and credit unions in our market areas. We expect continued competition from these financial institutions in the foreseeable future. With the continued acceptance of internet banking by our customers and consumers generally, competition for deposits has increased from institutions operating outside of our market area as well as from insurance companies. 

&#160; 

The following description of our market area is based upon information obtained from SNL Securities, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Federal Housing Financial Agency and the Mortgage Bankers Association. 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania Market Area . Our retail branch network within the state of Pennsylvania encompasses 28 counties. In addition, through our consumer finance offices we operate in 12 additional counties in the state. Our western Pennsylvania market has a diverse economy driven by healthcare and education industries, service businesses, technology companies and small manufacturing operations. Our southeastern Pennsylvania market is primarily driven by service businesses but also serves as a bedroom community to the cities of Baltimore, Maryland and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania is a stable banking market with a total population of approximately 12.8 million and total households of approximately 5.1 million as of December 31, 2015.

These markets have experienced a 1.2% decrease in population between 2010 and 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the markets' average median household income increased over the last year by 5.3%, to $49,585, compared to the national median income level of $55,551. However, the household income growth rate in Pennsylvania is projected to increase above the expected national average growth rates during the next five years by approximately 4.1%.

As of September 30, 2015, the foreclosure rate for mortgage loans on one-to-four unit residential properties in the state of New York was 4.8%, compared to the national average of 1.9%. 

Northeastern Ohio Market Area . With the acquisition of LNB our retail branch network increased from four to 25 community banking offices, which encompasses five counties in northeastern Ohio, including the Cleveland metro area. The major employment sectors in this market are similar to the contiguous market in western Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

Our Ohio market area has a total population of approximately 2.4 million and total households of approximately 1.0 million as of December 31, 2015. This area has experienced an increase in population between 2010 and 2015, of 1.0%.

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

General . &#32;Our principal lending activities are the origination of fixed-rate and, to a lesser extent, adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, shorter term consumer loans and the origination of loans collateralized by multi-family residential and commercial real estate and commercial business loans. Generally, we focus our lending activities in the geographic areas where we maintain offices. 

&#160; 

In an effort to manage interest rate risk, we have sought to make our interest-earning assets more interest rate sensitive by originating adjustable-rate loans, such as adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, and by originating short-term and medium-term fixed-rate consumer loans. In recent years we have emphasized the origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans, which generally have adjustable rates of interest and shorter maturities than one-to-four-family residential real estate loans. We also purchase mortgage-backed securities and other types of investment securities that generally have short average lives and/or adjustable interest rates. Because we originate a substantial amount of long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, when possible, we originate and underwrite loans according to standards that allow us to sell them into the secondary mortgage market for purposes of managing interest-rate risk and liquidity. The sale of mortgage loans supports our strategy to grow the consumer and commercial loan portfolios by more than our portfolio of long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans. We currently sell low-yielding fixed rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of more than 15 years, and on a more limited basis, those with maturities of 15 years or less, while retaining all adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. Although we sell a portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, we continue to be a portfolio lender, and at any one time hold few loans identified as held-for-sale. We currently retain servicing on the mortgage loans we sell which generates monthly service fee income. We generally retain in our portfolio all consumer loans that we originate while we periodically sell participations in the multi-family residential, commercial real estate or commercial business loans that we originate in an effort to reduce the concentration of certain individual credits and the risk associated with certain businesses, industries or geographies. 

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Loans . &#160; We offer residential mortgage loans with terms typically ranging from 15 to 30 years, with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Originations of fixed rate residential mortgage loans versus adjustable rate residential mortgage loans are monitored on an ongoing basis. The percentage of adjustable rate residential mortgage originations to total originations is affected significantly by the level of market interest rates, customer preference, our interest rate sensitivity and liquidity position, as well as loan products offered by our competitors. Therefore, even when our strategy is to increase the origination of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans, market conditions may be such that there is greater demand for fixed rate mortgage loans. Adjustable rate residential mortgage loans totaled $40.1 million, or 0.5%, of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Our fixed rate residential mortgage loan products offer fixed rates for up to 30 years. Whenever possible, our fixed rate residential mortgages are originated and underwritten according to secondary mortgage market guidelines in order to manage credit risk, as well as interest rate risk and liquidity. Our adjustable rate residential mortgage loans offer initial interest rate adjustment periods of one, three, and five years, terms up to 30 years and adjustments based on changes in designated market indices. All of our residential mortgage loans are amortized on a monthly basis with both principal and interest due monthly. 

&#160; 

Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to appraised values of real estate securing the loans, as determined by an appraisal at the time of loan origination. Appraisals are performed by in-house appraiser staff or by appraisers deemed qualified by our chief appraiser. Such regulations permit a maximum loan-to-value of 95% for residential properties and 

80% for all other real estate secured loans. We generally limit the maximum loan-to-value on both fixed- and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance, to 80% of the lesser of appraised values or purchase prices of real estate serving as collateral for our mortgage loans. Limited special financing programs allow for insured loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 97%, and uninsured loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90%. We require fire and casualty insurance, as well as a title guaranty regarding good title, on all properties securing our residential mortgage loans. We also require flood insurance for loans secured by properties located within special flood hazard areas. 

&#160; 

Included in our $2.741 billion portfolio of residential mortgage loans are construction loans of $16.1 million, or 0.1% of our gross loan portfolio. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential construction loans primarily for the construction of owner-occupied one-to-four-family residences in our market area to builders or to owners who have a contract for construction. Construction loans are generally structured to become permanent mortgages, and are originated with terms of up to 30 years with an allowance of up to one year for construction. Advances are made as construction is completed. In addition, we originate loans within our market area that are secured by individual unimproved or improved lots. Land loans for the construction of owner-occupied residential real estate properties are currently offered with fixed-rates for terms of up to 10 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for these loans is 80% of the as-completed appraised value, and the maximum loan-to-value ratio for construction loans is 95% of the lower of cost to build or as-completed appraised value. Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of credit risk than permanent residential mortgage lending, as repayment of construction loans is often dependent upon the successful completion of construction projects. Construction delays or the inability of borrowers to sell properties once construction is completed may impair borrowers&#8217; ability to repay loans. Private mortgage insurance is required for construction loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. 

&#160; 

Our residential mortgage loans customarily include due-on-sale clauses, which are provisions giving us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, borrowers sell or otherwise dispose of underlying real properties serving as collateral for loans. 

&#160; 

Some financial institutions we have acquired have held loans that are serviced by others and are secured by one-to-four-family residences. At December 31, 2015, our portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced by others totaled $3.5 million. We currently have no plans to enter into new residential mortgage loan participations. 

&#160; 

Home Equity Loans . &#32;Generally, our home equity loans are secured by the borrower&#8217;s principal residence with a maximum loan-to-value ratio, including the principal balances of both the first and second mortgage loans, of 90% or less. Home equity loans are offered on a fixed rate basis with terms of up to 20 years. Home equity lines of credit are offered on an adjustable-rate basis with terms of up to 25 years. All home equity lines of credit are underwritten assuming the borrower is required to immediately begin making principal and interest payments using the current rates on our equivalent fixed rate products. At December 31, 2015, the disbursed portion of home equity lines of credit totaled $462.0 million, or 6.2% of gross loans, with $198.8 million remaining undisbursed, and our fixed-rate home equity loans totaled $725.1 million, or 9.8% of gross loans. We generally underwrite home equity loans and lines of credit in a manner similar to our underwriting of residential mortgage loans. 

&#160; 

Other Consumer Loans . &#32;The principal types of other consumer loans we offer are direct and indirect automobile loans, sales finance loans, unsecured personal loans, credit card loans, and loans secured by deposit accounts. These loans are typically offered with maturities of ten years or less. 

&#160; 

The underwriting standards we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant&#8217;s credit history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant&#8217;s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally, from any verifiable secondary income. Creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration; however, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount. 

&#160; 

Consumer loans entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as automobiles, mobile homes, boats, recreation vehicles, appliances and furniture. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In particular, amounts realizable on the sale of repossessed automobiles may be significantly reduced based upon the condition of the automobiles and the lack of demand for used automobiles. At December 31, 2015, other consumer loans totaled $510.6 million, or 6.9% of gross loans. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans . &#32;Our multi-family commercial real estate loans are secured by multi-family residences, such as rental properties. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by nonresidential properties such as hotels, commercial offices, manufacturing facilities and retail establishments. At December 31, 2015, a significant portion of our multi-family commercial real estate and commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located within our market area. Our largest 

multi-family commercial real estate loan relationship at December 31, 2015 had a principal balance of $40.5 million, and was secured by eight multi-family residential properties. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms as of December 31, 2015. Our largest commercial real estate loan relationship at December 31, 2015, had a principal balance of $84.6 million and was secured by 18 commercial real estate properties including hotels, office and retail space. These loans were performing in accordance with their terms as of December 31, 2015. Multi-family commercial and commercial real estate loans are offered with both adjustable interest rates and fixed interest rates. The terms of each multi-family residential and commercial real estate loan are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. We generally originate multi-family commercial and commercial real estate loans in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property collateralizing the loan. 

&#160; 

Loans secured by multi-family commercial and commercial real estate generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties, and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family commercial and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate property. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 

&#160; 

Commercial Loans . &#32;We offer commercial loans to finance various activities in our market area, some of which are secured in part by additional real estate collateral. At December 31, 2015 our largest commercial loan relationship had a principal balance of $20.0 million, and was secured by equipment and real estate. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial business loans are offered with both fixed and adjustable interest rates. Underwriting standards we employ for commercial business loans include a determination of the applicant&#8217;s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan from operating cash flows generated by the applicant&#8217;s business. The financial strength of each applicant also is assessed through a review of financial statements provided by the applicant. 

&#160; 

Commercial loans generally have higher interest rates than residential loans, but they also may involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the successful operation of the borrower&#8217;s business. We generally obtain personal guarantees from the borrower or a third party as a condition to originating commercial loans. 

&#160; 

Loan Originations, Solicitation, Processing and Commitments . &#32;Upon receiving a retail loan application, we obtain a credit report and employment verification to verify specific information relating to the applicant&#8217;s employment, income, and credit standing. In the case of a real estate loan, either an in-house appraiser, or an approved external appraiser, appraises the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan. A loan processor checks the loan document file for accuracy and completeness, and verifies the information provided. 

&#160; 

For our personal loans, including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, credit cards and other unsecured loans, we have implemented a credit approval process based on a laddered individual loan authority system. Real estate secured loans are underwritten by our licensed mortgage loan originators. Non-real estate loans are underwritten by local loan officers who are granted various levels of authority based on their lending experience and expertise. These authority levels are reviewed by the Credit Committee on at least an annual basis. As part of the approval process, we assign independent credit officers to review the creditworthiness of all loans exceeding $500,000. If the credit officer has concerns regarding a loan that has been approved at a specific level, they have the authority to request that the loan be reviewed and approved at the next higher level. 

&#160; 

Our commercial loan policy assigns lending limits for our various commercial loan officers and stacked authorities for commercial loan officers with the approval of senior management. These individual and stacked authorities are established by the Credit Committee. The Senior Loan Committee may approve extensions of credit in excess of the stacked loan authorities. The Credit Committee meets quarterly to review the assigned lending limits and to monitor our lending policies, loan activity, economic conditions and concentrations of credit. 

Our general policy is to make no loans either individually or in the aggregate to one customer in excess of $20.0 million. Under certain circumstances; for instance well qualified customers or customers with multiple individually qualified projects, this limit may be exceeded subject to the approval of the Senior Loan Committee. The Chief Credit Officer reviews any loans exceeding $20.0 million or unusual loan requests with the Board of Directors. In addition, the Chief Credit Officer has the authority to require that the Board of Directors review any loan that has been approved by the Senior Loan Committee with which the Chief Credit Officer has specific concerns. Also, all loans originated during a calendar quarter of $5.0 million or more are reported to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors at the end of each quarter. Fire and casualty insurance is required at the time the loan is made and throughout the term of the loan, and flood insurance is required as determined by regulation. After the loan 

is approved, a loan commitment letter is promptly issued to the borrower. At December 31, 2015, we had commitments to originate $186.7 million of loans. 

&#160; 

If the loan is approved, the commitment letter specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount of the loan, interest rate, amortization period, maturity, a description of the required collateral and required insurance coverage. The borrower must provide proof of fire and casualty insurance on the property (and, as required, flood insurance) serving as collateral, which insurance must be maintained during the full term of the loan. Property searches are requested, as needed, on all loans secured by real property. 

&#160; 

Loan Origination Fees . &#32;We defer loan origination fees received from borrowers and costs to originate loans and amortize such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan by using the level yield method. Deferred loan fees and costs are recognized as part of interest income immediately upon prepayment or the sale of the related loan. At December 31, 2015, we had $20.1 million of net deferred loan origination costs. Loan origination fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments originated and purchased, principal repayments, and competitive conditions in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Income from net loan origination fees was $9.2 million, $8.2 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Loans-to-One Borrower . &#160; As of December 31, 2015, the largest aggregate amount loaned to one borrower, or related borrowers, totaled $84.6 million and was secured by 18 commercial real estate properties including hotels, office and retail space. Our second largest lending relationship totaled $65.3 million and was secured by seven commercial office buildings. Our third largest lending relationship totaled $49.3 million and was secured by eight commercial office buildings. Our fourth largest lending relationship totaled $44.8 million and was secured by a residential development. Our fifth largest lending relationship totaled $40.5 million and was secured by eight multi-family residential properties. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Investment Activities 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors has primary responsibility for establishing and overseeing our investment policy. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to implement the investment policy to our Chief Financial Officer. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the Chief Financial Officer, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The overall objectives of the Investment Policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments, to provide liquidity, and to control interest rate risk while providing an acceptable return. The investment portfolio is also used to provide collateral for qualified deposits and borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and to reduce our tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and potential returns. Either our Chief Financial Officer executes our securities portfolio transactions or another designee executes transactions as directed by the Chief Financial Officer. All purchase and sale transactions are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. 

&#160; 

Our investment policy does not permit the purchase of complex securities and derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations and other high-risk securities, nor does it permit additional investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities, pooled trust preferred securities, or single issuer trust preferred securities. 

&#160; 

At the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale based upon our ability and intentions. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value and securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. If impairment exists, credit related impairment losses are recorded in earnings while noncredit related impairment losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (for available for sale securities). The fair values of our securities are based on published or securities dealers&#8217; market values, when available. See note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed analysis and description of our investment portfolio and valuation techniques. 

&#160; 

We purchase debentures and mortgage-backed securities that generally are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Historically, we invested in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. However, in September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into conservatorship. The U.S. Treasury Department has established financing agreements to ensure that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed. These actions have not materially affected the markets for mortgage-backed securities issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. 

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General . &#32;Deposits are the major source of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, we derive funds from the amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, the maturity of investment securities, operations and, if needed, borrowings. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources or on a longer term basis for general business purposes, including to manage interest rate risk. 

&#160; 

Deposits . &#32;Personal and business deposits are generated from our market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, term certificate accounts and individual retirement accounts. While we accept deposits of $250,000 or more, we do not offer premium rates for such deposits. We accept brokered deposits through the CDARS program, but generally do not solicit funds outside our market area. As of December 31, 2015, we had deposits through the CDARS program with an aggregate balance of $50.1 million. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the period of time during which the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. We regularly execute changes in our deposit rates based upon general market interest rates, competition, and liquidity requirements. 

&#160; 

Borrowings. We also rely upon borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh typically are collateralized by a portion of our real estate loans. In addition to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, we have borrowing facilities with the Federal Reserve Bank, two correspondent banks and we borrow funds, in the form of corporate repurchase agreements, from municipalities, corporations and school districts. 

&#160; 

The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh functions as a central bank providing credit for Northwest Bank and other member financial institutions. As a member, Northwest Bank is required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and is authorized to apply for borrowings on the security of certain of its real estate loans, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Borrowings are made pursuant to several different programs. Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of borrowings are based either on a fixed percentage of a member institution&#8217;s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s creditworthiness. All of our Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh borrowings currently have fixed interest rates and original maturities of between one day and ten years.

The insured institution must also provide the FDIC such information as may be required by applicable regulations and must conduct the activity in accordance with the rules and orders of the FDIC. In addition to other enforcement and supervision powers, the FDIC may determine after notice and opportunity for a hearing that the continuation of a savings bank&#8217;s ownership of or relation to a subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the safety, soundness or stability of the savings bank, or is inconsistent with the purposes of federal banking laws.

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

Northwest Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and our deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund. Northwest Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Department of Banking and Securities of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the &#8220;Department of Banking&#8221;), as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposit accounts. Northwest Bank must file reports with the Department of Banking and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including acquisitions of other financial institutions. Northwest Bank is examined periodically by the Department of Banking and the FDIC to test Northwest Bank&#8217;s compliance with various laws and regulations. This regulation and supervision, as well as federal and state law, establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Northwest Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 

Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Department of Banking or the FDIC, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, Northwest Bank and their respective operations. 

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;), and are also required to file certain reports with and are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 

Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to Northwest Bank and Northwest Bancshares, Inc. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Northwest Bank and Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 

Pennsylvania Savings Bank Law 

The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the &#8220;Banking Code&#8221;) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, savings and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Pennsylvania savings banks. A Pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in, or adjacent to, Pennsylvania, with the prior approval of the Department of Banking. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department of Banking in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks. 

The Department of Banking generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department of Banking may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examination, the current practice is for the Department of Banking to conduct individual examinations. The Department of Banking may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, or employee of a savings bank engaged in a violation of law, unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty to show cause at a hearing before the Department of Banking why such person should not be removed. The Department of Banking may also appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution in appropriate cases. 

The &#8220;Banking Law Modernization Package&#8221; was Pennsylvania legislation effective on December 24, 2012. The legislation was intended to update, simplify and modernize the banking laws of Pennsylvania and reduce regulatory burden where possible. The legislation, among other things, increased the threshold for investments in bank premises without Department of Banking approval from 25% of capital, surplus, undivided profits and capital securities to 100%, eliminated archaic lending requirements and pricing restrictions and changed the procedure for Pennsylvania state chartered institutions closing a branch from an application for approval to a notice. The legislation also clarified the Department of Banking&#8217;s examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries of Pennsylvania institutions and authorized the assessment of civil money penalties of up to $25,000 under certain circumstances for violations of laws or orders related to the institution or unsafe or unsound practices or breaches of fiduciary duties. 

Federal Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC currently maintains the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;), which was created in 2006 through the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The deposit accounts of our subsidiary bank are insured by the DIF to the maximum amount provided by law. This insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. 

As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by DIF-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. 

The FDIC imposes assessments for deposit insurance on an insured institution quarterly according to its ranking in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations. The assessment rate for an individual institution is determined according to a formula based on a weighted average of the institution&#8217;s individual CAMELS component ratings plus various financial ratios. Well-capitalized institutions (generally those with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2) are grouped in Risk Category I and their initial base assessment rate for deposit insurance is set at an annual rate of between 5 and 9 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. The initial base assessment rate for institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV is set at annual rates of 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively. These initial base assessment rates are adjusted to determine an institution&#8217;s final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits and unsecured debt. The adjustments include higher premiums for institutions that rely significantly on excessive amounts of brokered deposits, including CDARS, while providing a reduction for all institutions 

for their unsecured debt. Total base assessment rates after adjustments range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV. 

The FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR) of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset or how larger institutions will be affected by it. 

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or written agreement entered into with the FDIC. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

Capital Requirements 

Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g . , recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 

Any institution that fails any of the regulatory capital requirements is subject to enforcement action by the FDIC. Such action may include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, restrictions on an institution&#8217;s operations, termination of federal deposit insurance, and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Such action, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, may require a variety of corrective measures. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The following table shows the Basel III regulatory capital levels that must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments for the periods indicated:

Northwest Bank is also subject to capital guidelines of the Department of Banking. Although not adopted in regulation form, the Department of Banking requires 6% leverage capital and 10% risk-based capital. The components of leverage and risk-based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The applicable FDIC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Institutions that fall into an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; category are subject to a variety of mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions, including a restriction on capital distributions and the requirement to file a capital restoration plan with the regulators. Performance under the capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by the parent holding company up to the lesser of the amount of the capital deficiency when deemed undercapitalized or 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets. Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). As of December 31, 2015, Northwest Bank was &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for this purpose. 

Loans-to-One Borrower Limitation 

In accordance with the Banking Code, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank, with certain limited exceptions, may lend to a single or related group of borrowers on an &#8220;unsecured&#8221; basis an amount equal to 15% of its capital accounts, the aggregate of capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and reserve for loan losses. We have established an internal lending limit, either individually or in the aggregate to one customer, of $20.0 million. Under certain circumstances, for instance well qualified customers or customers with multiple individually qualified projects, this limit may be exceeded subject to the approval of the Senior Loan Committee. As of December 31, 2015 we had 15 credit relationships that equal or exceed our $20.0 million internal limit. 

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks 

Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not, directly or indirectly, acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things: (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary; (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s total assets; (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures liability insurance for directors, trustees or officers, or blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. Activities of state banks 

and their subsidiaries are generally limited to those permissible for national banks. Exceptions include where the bank meets applicable regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the proposed activity does not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. 

The USA PATRIOT Act 

The USA Patriot Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA Patriot Act also requires the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. 

Holding Company Regulation 

General . &#32;&#32;Federal law allows a state savings bank, such as Northwest Bank, to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan company provisions of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act of 1933, as amended, provided that it qualifies as a &#8220;Qualified Thrift Lender.&#8221; Such election results in its holding company being regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve Board rather than as a bank holding company. Northwest Bank has made such an election. Therefore, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act of 1933, as amended. As such, we are registered as a savings and loan holding company with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and any non-savings institution subsidiaries of the Company. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 

Permissible Activities. The business activities of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities. The Dodd-Frank Act specifies that a savings and loan holding company may only engage in financial holding company activities if it meets the qualitative criteria necessary for a bank holding company to engage in such activities. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations. 

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Northwest Bancshares, Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits, with certain exceptions, the acquisition or retention of more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider, among other factors, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 

(i) 

the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and 

(ii) 

the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition. 

The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . &#32;&#32;To be regulated as a savings and loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Northwest Bank must qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender. To qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender, Northwest Bank must be a &#8220;domestic building and loan association,&#8221; as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, or comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test. Under the Qualified Thrift Lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; (total assets less: (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (2) intangibles, including goodwill; and (3) the value 

of property used to conduct business) in certain &#8220;qualified thrift investments&#8221; (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period. As of December 31, 2015, Northwest Bank met the Qualified Thrift Lender test. 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish, for all depository institution holding companies, minimum consolidated capital levels that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to savings and loan holding companies (of greater than $1 billion in consolidated assets), as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019. 

Source of Strength/Capital Distributions. &#32;&#32;The Dodd-Frank Act extended to savings and loan holding companies the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine, which has long applied to bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy, which requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company&#8217;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company&#8217;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary depository institution becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions, including stock repurchases. 

As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Northwest Bank must notify the Federal Reserve Board thirty days before declaring any dividend to the Company. The dividend notice may be objected to under certain circumstances, such as where the dividend raises safety or soundness concerns, the dividend would cause the savings bank to be undercapitalized or the dividend would violate a law, regulation, regulatory condition or enforcement order. 

Federal Securities Laws 

Our common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). We are also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 

&#160; 

Federal Taxation . &#160; For federal income tax purposes, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. files a consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly-owned subsidiaries on a calendar year basis. The applicable federal income tax expense or benefit is properly allocated to each subsidiary based upon taxable income or loss calculated on a separate company basis. 

&#160; 

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which accounts for deferred income taxes by applying the enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The resulting deferred tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws. 

&#160; 

State Taxation . &#160; As a Maryland business corporation, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is required to file annual tax returns with the State of Maryland. In addition, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is subject to Pennsylvania&#8217;s corporate net income tax and capital stock tax. Dividends received from Northwest Bank qualify for a 100% dividends received deduction and are not subject to corporate net income tax. 

&#160; 

Northwest Bank is subject to Pennsylvania&#8217;s mutual thrift institutions tax based on Northwest Bank&#8217;s net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with certain adjustments. The tax rate under the mutual thrift institutions tax is 11.5%. Interest on Pennsylvania and federal obligations is excluded from net income. An allocable portion of interest expense incurred to carry the obligations is disallowed as a deduction. Northwest Bank is also subject to taxes in the other states in which it conducts business. These taxes are apportioned based upon the volume of business conducted in those states as a percentage of the whole. Because a majority of Northwest Bank&#8217;s affairs are conducted in Pennsylvania, taxes paid to other states are not material. 

&#160; 

The subsidiaries of Northwest Bank are subject to a Pennsylvania corporate net income tax and a capital stock tax, and are also subject to other applicable taxes in the states where they conduct business.
