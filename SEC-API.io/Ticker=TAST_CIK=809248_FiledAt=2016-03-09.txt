 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Our Company 

We are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 50 years. We are the largest Burger King&#174; franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of January 3, 2016 , we owned and operated 705 &#32;Burger King restaurants located in 16 &#32;Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. Burger King restaurants feature the popular flame-broiled Whopper&#174; sandwich, as well as a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, salads, breakfast items, hot dogs, snacks, smoothies, frappes and other offerings. We believe that our size, seasoned management team, extensive operating infrastructure, experience and proven operating disciplines differentiate us from many of our competitors as well as many other Burger King operators. 

According to BKC, as of December 31, 2015 there were a total of 15,003 Burger King restaurants, of which &#32; approximately 100% were franchised and 7,355 &#32;were located in the United States and Canada. Burger King is the second largest hamburger restaurant chain in the world (as measured by number of restaurants) and we believe that the Burger King brand is one of the world's most recognized consumer brands. Burger King restaurants have a distinctive image and are generally located in high-traffic areas throughout the United States. Burger King restaurants are designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, with multiple day-part meal segments targeted to different groups of consumers. We believe that the competitive attributes of Burger King restaurants include significant brand recognition, convenience of location, quality, speed of service and price. 

Our Burger King restaurants are typically open seven days per week and generally have operating hours ranging from 6:00 am to midnight on Sunday to Wednesday and to 2:00 am on Thursday to Saturday. 

Our existing restaurants consist of one of several building types with various seating capacities. Our typical freestanding restaurant contains approximately 2,800 to 3,200 square feet with seating capacity for 90 to 100 customers, has drive-thru service windows and has adjacent parking areas. The building types for recently constructed or remodeled Burger King restaurants utilize 2,600 square feet and typically have seating capacity for 60 to 70 customers. As of January 3, 2016 , almost all of our restaurants were freestanding. We operate our restaurants under franchise agreements with BKC. 

&#32;On May 7, 2012, we completed the spin-off of Fiesta Restaurant Group, which included the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurant businesses which we refer to as the "spin-off". 

On May 30, 2012, we acquired 278 Burger King restaurants ("the 2012 acquired restaurants") from BKC, which we refer to as the "2012 acquisition", including BKC's assignment of its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers in 20 states as follows: Connecticut (except Hartford county), Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts (except for Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties), Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 

York (except for Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk and Westchester counties), North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Washington DC and West Virginia, (the "ROFR") pursuant to an operating agreement with BKC dated May 30, 2012, and as amended on January 26, 2015 and December 17, 2015, which we refer to as the "operating agreement". In addition, pursuant to the operating agreement, BKC granted us, on a non-exclusive basis, franchise pre-approval to acquire restaurants from Burger King franchisees in the 20 states covered by the ROFR until we operate 1,000 Burger King restaurants. Newly constructed or acquired restaurants beyond 1,000 or acquisitions in states not subject to the ROFR would be subject to BKC's customary approval process. The amended operating agreement requires us to remodel 455 Burger King restaurants to BKC's "20/20" restaurant image by December 31, 2016. 

As of January 3, 2016 , we were operating 246 &#32;of the 2012 acquired restaurants. In 2014 we acquired an additional 123 restaurants from other franchisees in five separate transactions, which we refer to as the "2014 acquired restaurants". Additionally, in 2015 we acquired 55 restaurants from other franchisees in eight separate transactions, which we refer to as the "2015 acquired restaurants". All of our other Burger King restaurants are referred to as our "legacy restaurants". 

For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 , our restaurants generated total revenues of $859.0 million &#32;and our comparable restaurant sales increased 7.4% . Our average annual restaurant sales for all restaurants were approximately $1,297,000 &#32;per restaurant. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe we have the following competitive strengths: 

Largest Burger King Franchisee in the United States. We are the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States based on number of restaurants, and are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry. We believe the geographic dispersion of our restaurants provides us with stability and enhanced growth opportunities in many of the markets in which we operate. We also believe that our large number of restaurants increases our ability to effectively manage the awareness of the Burger King brand in certain markets through our ability to influence local advertising and promotional activities. 

Operational Expertise. We have been operating Burger King restaurants since 1976 and have developed sophisticated information and operating systems that enable us to measure and monitor key metrics for operational performance, sales and profitability that may not be available to other restaurant operators. Our focus on leveraging our operational expertise, infrastructure and systems allows us to optimize the performance of our restaurants and restaurants that we may acquire. Our size and history with the Burger King brand enable us to effectively track operating metrics and leverage best practices across our organization. We believe that our experienced management team, operating culture, effective operating systems and infrastructure enable us to operate more efficiently than many other Burger King operators, resulting in higher restaurant margins and improved overall financial results. 

Consistent Operating History and Financial Strength. We believe that the quality and sophistication of our restaurant operations have driven our strong restaurant level performance. Comparable restaurant sales for our restaurants have generally outperformed the Burger King system. Our strong restaurant level operations coupled with our financial management capabilities have resulted in consistent and stable cash flows. We have demonstrated our ability to prudently manage financial leverage through a variety of economic cycles. We believe that our cash flow from operations and the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility will be used to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures. 

Distinct Brand with Global Recognition, Innovative Marketing and New Product Development. As a Burger King franchisee, we benefit from, and rely on, BKC's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased restaurant traffic. Over the years, BKC has launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns that highlight the popular relevance of the Burger King brand. BKC has also introduced promotions that leverage both value and premium menu offerings as well as providing a platform for new premium sandwich offerings. We believe these campaigns continue to positively impact the brand today as BKC focuses on a well-balanced promotional mix and remains committed to focusing on fewer but more impactful new product launches and limited time offers, both of which continue to show positive trends. BKC is also aggressively 

working with franchisees throughout the system to encourage the renovation and remodeling of restaurants to BKC's 20/20 image, which we believe will continue to increase customer traffic and restaurant sales. 

Strategic Relationship with Burger King Corporation. We believe that the structure of the 2012 acquisition strengthens our well-established relationship with BKC and further aligns our common interests to grow our business. We intend to continue to expand by making acquisitions, including acquisitions resulting from the exercise of the ROFR obtained in the 2012 acquisition as well as other negotiated acquisitions under our pre-approval rights. The consideration to BKC associated with the 2012 acquisition included an equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group, which is now approximately 20.8% . Since the 2012 acquisition, two of BKC's senior executives have served on our Board of Directors. Jose Cil, Executive Vice President and President, Burger King, of Restaurant Brands International Inc., the indirect parent company of BKC, and Alexandre Macedo, BKC's President of North America, currently serve on our board of directors. Our restaurants represent approximately 9.6% &#32;of the Burger King locations in North America as of January 3, 2016 . We believe that the combination of our rights under the operating agreement, BKC's equity interest and its board level representation will continue to reinforce the alignment of our common interests with BKC for the long term. 

Multiple Growth Levers. &#32;&#32;We believe our historical track record of acquiring and integrating restaurants and our commitment to remodel our restaurants provides multiple avenues to grow our business. With more than 50 years of restaurant operating experience, we have successfully grown our business through acquisitions. We have experienced increases in comparable restaurant sales, increased restaurant-level profitability and improved operating metrics at the restaurants we have acquired in the last four years. In addition, we have remodeled a total of 396 &#32;restaurants to BKC&#8217;s 20/20 restaurant image as of January 3, 2016 &#32;which we believe has improved the guests&#8217; overall experience and increased customer traffic. 

Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record. We believe that our senior management team's extensive experience in the restaurant industry and its long and successful history of developing, acquiring, integrating and operating quick-service restaurants provide us with a competitive advantage. Our management team has a successful history of integrating acquired restaurants, and over the past 20 years, we have significantly increased the number of Burger King restaurants we own and operate, largely through acquisitions. Our operations are overseen by our Chief Executive Officer, Dan Accordino, who has over 40 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience and nine Regional Directors that have an average of 27 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Ninety-six &#32;district managers that have an average tenure of 19 years in the Burger King system support the Regional Directors. Our operations management is further supported by our infrastructure of financial, information systems, real estate, human resources and legal professionals. 

Our Business Strategies 

Our primary business strategies are as follows: 

Increase Restaurant Sales and Customer Traffic. BKC has identified and implemented a number of strategies to increase brand awareness, increase market share, improve overall operations and drive sales. These strategies are central to our strategic objectives to deliver profitable growth. 

&#8226; 

Products. The strength of the BKC menu has been built on a distinct flame-grilled cooking platform to make better tasting hamburgers. We believe that BKC intends to continue to optimize the menu by focusing on core products, such as the flagship Whopper&#174; sandwich, while maintaining a balance between value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive sales and traffic. Recent &#32; product innovation has included a multi-tier balanced marketing approach to value and premium offerings, pairing value promotions, such as the $1.49 10-piece chicken nugget promotion, with 2 for $5 premium limited time offerings, such as the X-Long Pulled Pork sandwich, Grilled Chicken Burger and X-Long Jalapeno Cheeseburger. In 2016 promotional initiatives have included a 5 for $4 value offering and the introduction of grilled hot dogs. There have also been a number of enhancements to food preparation procedures to improve the quality of BKC's existing products. These new menu platforms and quality improvements form the backbone of BKC's strategy to appeal to a broader consumer base and to increase restaurant sales. 

&#8226; 

Image. We believe that re-imaged restaurants increase curb appeal and result in increased restaurant sales. We have remodeled 396 &#32;restaurants to BKC's 20/20 restaurant image which features a fresh, sleek, eye-catching design. The restaurant redesign incorporates easy-to-navigate digital menu boards in the dining room, streamlined merchandising at the drive-thru and flat screen televisions in the dining area. We believe the restaurant remodeling plan has improved our guests' dining experience and increased customer traffic. As of January 3, 2016 &#32;we have a total of 432 &#32;restaurants with the 20/20 restaurant image, which includes restaurants converted prior to our acquisition. 

&#8226; 

Advertising and Promotion. We believe that we will continue to benefit from BKC's advertising support of its menu items, product enhancement and reimaging initiatives. BKC has established a data driven marketing process which has focused on driving restaurant sales and traffic, while targeting a broad consumer base with more inclusive messaging. This strategy uses multiple touch points to advertise our products, including digital advertising, social media and on-line video in addition to traditional television advertising. BKC has a food-centric marketing strategy which focuses consumers on the food offerings, the core asset, and balances value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive profitable restaurant sales and traffic. 

&#8226; 

Operations. &#32;We believe that improving restaurant operations and enhancing the customer experience are key components to increasing the profitability of our restaurants. We believe we will benefit from BKC's ongoing initiatives to improve food quality, simplify restaurant level execution and monitor operational performance, all of which are designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer traffic. 

Strategically Remodel to Elevate Brand Profile and Increase Profit Potential. Over the next year, we plan to strategically remodel an additional 85 to 95 &#32;more locations to BKC's 20/20 image. Over the past four years, our restaurants remodeled to BKC's 20/20 image have generated an average sales lift of approximately 10% to 12% and have resulted in an attractive return on investment. We believe there are opportunities to increase profitability by remodeling additional restaurants including restaurants that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. 

Selectively Acquire and Develop Additional Burger King Restaurants. As of January 3, 2016 , we operated 705 &#32;Burger King restaurants, making us one of the largest Burger King franchisees in the world. We acquired the ROFR in the 2012 acquisition and were granted certain pre-approval rights to acquire additional franchised restaurants and to develop new restaurants. Due to the number of restaurants and franchisees in the Burger King system and our historical success in acquiring and integrating restaurants, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for future growth. There are more than 2,000 Burger King restaurants we do not own in states in which we have the ROFR and pre-approval rights. Furthermore, we believe there are additional Burger King restaurants in states not subject to the ROFR that could be attractive acquisition candidates, subject to BKC's customary approval. We believe that the assignment of the ROFR and the pre-approval to acquire and develop additional restaurants provide us with the opportunity to significantly expand our ownership of Burger King restaurants in the future. While we may evaluate and discuss potential acquisitions of additional restaurants from time to time, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions. We may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all. 

Improve Profitability of Restaurants We Acquire by Leveraging Our Existing Infrastructure and Best-Practices. For acquired restaurants, we believe we can realize benefits from economies of scale, including leveraging our existing infrastructure across a larger number of restaurants. Additionally, we believe that our skilled management team, sophisticated information technology, operating systems and training and development programs support our ability to enhance operating efficiencies at any restaurants we may acquire. We have demonstrated our ability to increase the profitability of acquired restaurants and we believe, over time, that we will improve profitability and operational efficiency at the restaurants we have and may acquire.

Average annual sales per restaurant are derived by dividing restaurant sales by the average number of restaurants operating during the period on a 52-week basis. 

Restaurant Capital Costs 

The initial cost of the franchise fee, equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs of a standard new Burger King restaurant currently is approximately $380,000 (which excludes the cost of the land, building and site improvements). In the markets in which we primarily operate, the cost of land generally ranges from $600,000 to $800,000 and the cost of building and site improvements generally ranges from $825,000 to $925,000. 

With respect to development of freestanding restaurants, we generally seek to acquire the land to construct the building, and thereafter enter into an arrangement to sell and leaseback the land and building under a long-term lease. Historically, we have been able to acquire and finance many of our locations under such leasing arrangements. Where we are unable to purchase the underlying land, we enter into a long-term lease for the land and fund the construction of the building from cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility rather than through long-term leasing arrangements. 

The cost of developing and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from, and may be significantly higher than, both the historical cost of restaurants previously opened and the estimated costs above. 

BKC's 20/20 restaurant design draws inspiration from its signature flame-grilled cooking process and incorporates a variety of innovative elements to a backdrop that evokes the industrial look of corrugated metal, brick, wood and concrete. The cost of remodeling a restaurant to the 20/20 image varies depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed and can range from $250,000 to $650,000 &#32;per restaurant with a projected cost of approximately $480,000 per restaurant in 2016 and an average cost of $380,000 over the past three years. The total cost of a remodel has increased over time due to the replacement of certain kitchen equipment at the time of the remodel which is incremental to the cost to upgrade to the 20/20 design. Pursuant to the operating agreement, as amended, we agreed to remodel 455 Burger King restaurants to BKC's 20/20 restaurant image by December 31, 2016. In connection with the acquisition of 64 Burger King restaurants in 2014, we entered into an agreement with BKC to remodel 46 of the restaurants acquired over a five-year period beginning in 2014. We have remodeled a total of 396 &#32;restaurants as of January 3, 2016 &#32;and we plan to remodel approximately 85 to 95 &#32;additional restaurants in 2016 . See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations". 

Site Selection 

We believe that the location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management determines the acceptability of all acquisition prospects and new sites, based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals. 

Seasonality 

Our business is moderately seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Due to the location of our restaurants, sales are generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

Operations 

Management Structure 

We conduct substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing and operations support functions from our corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York. Carrols Restaurant Group is led by our Chief Executive Officer and President, Daniel T. Accordino, who has over 40 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience at our company. 

Our operations for our restaurants are overseen by nine Regional Directors that have an average of over 27 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Ninety-six &#32;district managers support the Regional Directors in the management of our restaurants. 

A district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven to eight restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants. Regional directors, district managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision, and for our regional directors and district managers, the combined performance of all of our restaurants. Typically, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried manager and one to three salaried assistant managers. 

Training 

We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly personnel. The program emphasizes system-wide operating procedures, food preparation methods and customer service standards. BKC's training and development programs are also available to us as a franchisee. 

Management Information Systems 

Our sophisticated management information systems provide us with the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. Our size affords us the ability to maintain an in-house staff of information technology and restaurant systems professionals dedicated to continuously enhancing our systems. In addition, these capabilities allow us to integrate restaurants that we acquire and achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies. 

We typically replace the POS systems at restaurants we acquire shortly after acquisition and implement our POS, labor and inventory management systems. Our restaurants employ touch-screen POS systems that are designed to facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking. These systems are user-friendly, require limited cashier training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with PC-based applications at the restaurant and hosted systems at our corporate office that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. 

Our restaurant systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs and inventories, and other key operating metrics for each restaurant. We communicate electronically with our restaurants on a continuous basis via a high-speed data network, which enables us to collect this information for use in our corporate management systems in near real-time. Our corporate headquarters manages systems that support all of our accounting, operating and reporting systems. We also operate a 24-hour, seven-day help desk at our corporate headquarters that enables us to provide systems and operational support to our restaurant operations as required. Among other things, our restaurant information systems provide us with the ability to: 

&#8226; 

monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant, enabling the restaurant manager to effectively manage to our established labor standards on a timely basis; 

&#8226; 

reduce inventory shrinkage using restaurant-level quantity-based inventory management systems and daily reporting of inventory variances; 

&#8226; 

analyze sales and product mix data to help restaurant managers forecast production levels; 

&#8226; 

monitor day-part drive-thru speed of service at each of our restaurants; 

&#8226; 

allow the restaurant manager to produce day-part labor schedules based on the restaurant's historical sales patterns; 

&#8226; 

systematically communicate human resource and payroll data to our administrative offices for efficient centralized management of labor costs and payroll processing; 

&#8226; 

employ centralized control over price, menu and inventory management activities at the restaurant utilizing the remote management capabilities of our systems; 

&#8226; 

take advantage of electronic commerce including our ability to place orders with suppliers and to integrate detailed invoice, receiving and product data with our inventory and accounting systems; 

&#8226; 

provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data; and 

&#8226; 

systematically analyze and report on detailed transactional data to help detect and identify potential theft. 

Critical information from our systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information for their respective restaurants and have access to key operating data on a remote basis using our corporate intranet-based reporting. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize key restaurant performance indicators that are also included in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans. 

Burger King Franchise Agreements 

Each of our Burger King restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with BKC. Our franchise agreements with BKC generally require, among other things, that all restaurants comply with specified design criteria and operate in a prescribed manner, including utilization of the standard Burger King menu. In addition, our Burger King franchise agreements generally require that our restaurants conform to BKC's current image and provide for remodeling of our restaurants during the tenth year of the agreements to conform to such current image, which may require significant expenditures. These franchise agreements with BKC generally provide for an initial term of 20 years and currently have an initial franchise fee of $50,000. In the event that we terminate any franchise agreement and close the related BKC restaurant prior to the expiration of its term, we generally are required to pay BKC an amount based on the net present value of the royalty stream that would have been realized by BKC had such franchise agreement not been terminated. Any franchise agreement, including renewals, can be extended at our discretion for an additional 20-year term, with BKC's approval, provided that, among other things, the restaurant meets the current Burger King operating and image standards and that we are not in default under the terms of the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement fee for subsequent renewals is currently $50,000. BKC may terminate any of the franchise agreements if an act of default is committed by us under these agreements and such default is not cured. Defaults under the franchise agreements include, among other things, our failure to operate such Burger King restaurant in accordance with the operating standards and specifications established by BKC (including failure to use equipment, uniforms or decor approved by BKC), our failure to sell products approved or designated by BKC, our failure to pay royalties or advertising and sales promotion contributions as required, our unauthorized sale, transfer or assignment of such franchise agreement or the related restaurant, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, conduct by us or our employees that has a harmful effect on the Burger King restaurant system, conviction of us or our executive officers for certain indictable offenses, our failure to maintain a responsible credit rating or the acquisition by us of an interest in any other hamburger restaurant business. At January 3, 2016 , we were not in default under any of the franchise agreements with BKC. 

In order to obtain a successor franchise agreement with BKC, a franchisee is typically required to make capital improvements to the restaurant to bring it up to BKC's current image standards. The cost of these improvements may vary widely depending upon the magnitude of the required changes and the degree to which we have made interim improvements to the restaurant. At January 3, 2016 , we had 36 &#32;franchise agreements due to expire in 2016 , 49 &#32;franchise agreements due to expire in 2017 &#32;and 29 &#32;franchise agreements due to expire in 2018 . In recent years, the historical costs of improving our Burger King restaurants in connection with franchise renewals generally have ranged from $250,000 to $650,000 &#32;per restaurant. The average cost of our remodels to the 20/20 image in 2015 was approximately $450,000 &#32;per restaurant. The cost of remodels can vary depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed. The cost of capital improvements made in connection with future franchise agreement renewals may differ substantially from past franchise renewals depending on the current image requirements established from time to time by BKC. 

We believe that we will be able to satisfy BKC's normal franchise agreement renewal criteria. Accordingly, we believe that renewal franchise agreements will be granted on a timely basis by BKC at the expiration of our existing franchise agreements. Historically, BKC has granted all of our requests for successor franchise agreements. However, there can be no assurance that BKC will grant these requests in the future. 

We evaluate the performance of our Burger King restaurants on an ongoing basis. Such evaluation depends on many factors, among other things, including our assessment of the anticipated future operating results of the subject restaurants and the cost of required capital improvements that we would need to commit for such restaurants. If we determine that a Burger King restaurant is under-performing, or that we do not anticipate an adequate return on the capital required to renew the franchise agreement, we may elect to close such restaurant. We may also relocate (offset) a restaurant within its trade area and build a new Burger King restaurant as part of the franchise renewal process. In 2015 , we closed 23 &#32;restaurants. We currently do not expect to close any restaurants in 2016 , excluding any relocation of existing restaurants. Our determination to close these restaurants is subject to further evaluation and may change. &#32;&#32; We may also elect to close additional restaurants in the future. 

In addition to the initial franchise fee, we generally pay BKC a monthly royalty. The royalty rate for new restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 4.5% of sales. Royalty payments for restaurants acquired from other franchisees are based on the terms of existing franchise agreements being acquired, and may be less than 4.5%. The royalty rate was increased from 3.5% to 4.5% of sales in 2000, and generally for restaurants that were in existence 

in 2000, becomes effective upon the renewal of the franchise agreement. Burger King royalties, as a percentage of our restaurant sales, were 4.2% &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . We anticipate our Burger King royalties, as a percentage of our restaurant sales, will be 4.2% in 2016 &#32;as a result of the terms outlined above. 

We also generally contribute 4% of restaurant sales from our Burger King restaurants to fund BKC's national and regional advertising. BKC engages in substantial national and regional advertising and promotional activities and other efforts to maintain and enhance the Burger King brand. From time to time we supplement BKC's marketing with our own local advertising and promotional campaigns. See &#8220;- Advertising, Products and Promotion&#8221; below. 

Our franchise agreements with BKC do not give us exclusive rights to operate Burger King restaurants in any defined territory. Although we believe that BKC generally seeks to ensure that newly granted franchises do not materially adversely affect the operations of existing Burger King restaurants, we cannot assure you that franchises granted by BKC to third parties will not adversely affect any Burger King restaurants that we operate. 

Except as permitted by the operating agreement, we are required to obtain BKC's consent before we acquire existing Burger King restaurants from other franchisees or develop new Burger King restaurants. BKC also has the right of first refusal to purchase any Burger King restaurant that is being offered for sale by a franchisee. However, pursuant to the operating agreement, BKC assigned the ROFR to us in 20 states and granted us franchise pre-approval to build new restaurants or acquire restaurants from franchisees until the date that we operate 1,000 restaurants. Historically, BKC has approved substantially all of our acquisitions of restaurants from other franchisees. 

Advertising, Products and Promotion 

BKC's marketing strategy is characterized by its HAVE IT YOUR WAY&#174; service, TASTE IS KING&#174; tag line, flame grilling, generous portions and competitive prices. Burger King restaurants feature flame-grilled hamburgers, the most popular of which is the Whopper&#174; sandwich, a large, flame-grilled hamburger garnished with mayonnaise, lettuce, onions, pickles and tomatoes. The basic menu of all Burger King restaurants also includes a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks, salads, breakfast items, snacks, and other offerings. BKC and its franchisees have historically spent between 4% and 5% of their respective sales on marketing, advertising and promotion to sustain high brand awareness. BKC's marketing initiatives are designed to reach a diverse consumer base and BKC has continued to introduce a number of new and enhanced products to broaden menu offerings and drive customer traffic in all day parts. 

We are generally required to contribute 4% of restaurant sales to an advertising fund utilized by BKC for its advertising, promotional programs and public relations activities. BKC's advertising programs consist of national campaigns supplemented by local advertising. BKC's advertising campaigns are generally carried on television, radio and in circulated print media (national and regional newspapers and magazines). As a percentage of our restaurant sales advertising expense was 3.8% &#32;in 2015 , 4.0% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 4.5% &#32;in 2013 . For 2016 &#32;we anticipate advertising expense to range between 4.2% and 4.4% of restaurant sales. 

The efficiency and quality of advertising and promotional programs can significantly affect the quick-service restaurant businesses. We believe that one of the major advantages of being a Burger King franchisee is the value of the extensive national and regional advertising and promotional programs conducted by BKC. In addition to the benefits derived from BKC's advertising spending, we sometimes supplement BKC's advertising and promotional activities with our own local advertising and promotions, including the purchase of additional television, radio and print advertising. The concentration of our Burger King restaurants in many of our markets permits us to leverage advertising in those markets. We also utilize promotional programs, such as combination value meals and discounted prices, targeted to our customers, in order to create a flexible and directed marketing program. 

In connection with BKC's 2011 initiatives to support the installation of digital menu boards, the introduction of new menu items and enhancements to the quality of our food preparation, BKC reduced the required advertising contribution by $5,400 per restaurant per year through 2015, for those restaurants whose expenditures included a digital menu board, and $3,000 per restaurant per year through 2015, for those restaurants whose expenditures excluded a digital menu board. 

Suppliers 

We are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, Inc., which we refer to as "RSI", created for the Burger King system. RSI is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for 

sourcing our products and related supplies and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Burger King system. We use our purchasing power to negotiate directly with certain other vendors, to obtain favorable pricing and terms for supplying our restaurants. For our restaurants, we are required to purchase all of our foodstuffs, paper goods and packaging materials from BKC-approved suppliers at prices negotiated by RSI. We currently utilize three distributors, Maines Paper &#38; Food Service, Inc., Reinhart Food Service L.L.C. and MBM Food Service Inc., to supply our restaurants with the majority of our foodstuffs and, as of January 3, 2016 , such distributors supplied 39% , 33% &#32;and 28% , respectively, of our restaurants. We may purchase non-food items, such as kitchen utensils, equipment maintenance tools and other supplies, from any suitable source so long as such items meet BKC product uniformity standards. All BKC-approved distributors are required to purchase foodstuffs and supplies from BKC-approved manufacturers and purveyors. BKC is responsible for monitoring quality control and supervision of these manufacturers and conducts regular visits to observe the preparation of foodstuffs, and to run various tests to ensure that only quality foodstuffs are sold to its approved suppliers. In addition, BKC coordinates and supervises audits of approved suppliers and distributors to determine continuing product specification compliance and to ensure that manufacturing plant and distribution center standards are met. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply available to our restaurants, in the event any distributor or supplier for our restaurants was unable to service us, this could lead to a disruption of service or supply at our restaurants until a new distributor or supplier is engaged, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Quality Assurance 

Our operational focus is closely monitored to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction via speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with BKC's required operating procedures. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the premises and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute to our restaurant operations management team detailed reports measuring compliance with various customer service standards and objectives, including feedback obtained directly from our customers through instructions given to them at the point of sale. The customer feedback is monitored by an independent agency and us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have our own staff that handle customer inquiries and complaints. The level of customer satisfaction is a key metric in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans. 

We operate in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These standards include food preparation rules regarding, among other things, minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness. To maintain these standards, under BKC's oversight third-party firms conduct unscheduled inspections and follow-up inspections of our restaurants and report their findings to us. In addition, restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 

Trademarks 

As a franchisee of Burger King, we also have contractual rights to use certain BKC-owned trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property relating to the Burger King concept. We have no proprietary intellectual property other than the Carrols logo and trademark. 

Government Regulation 

Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or remodeled are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and remodeling of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as: 

&#8226; 

minimum wage requirements; 

&#8226; 

unemployment compensation; 

&#8226; 

overtime; and 

&#8226; 

other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 

A significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the federal, and where applicable, state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage have increased and in the future will increase wage rates at our restaurants. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) required businesses employing fifty or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care benefits to those full-time employees or be subject to an annual penalty. Those benefits must be provided under a health care plan which provides a certain minimum scope of health care services. The Act also limits the portion of the cost of the benefits which we can require employees to pay. Based on our enrollment history to date, approximately 15% of our approximately 1,300 eligible hourly employees have opted for coverage under our medical plan. 

We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our costs for compliance with environmental laws or regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition in the past . 

Industry and Competition 

The Restaurant Market. Restaurant sales historically have closely tracked several macroeconomic indicators and we believe that &#8220;away-from-home&#8221; food consumption will increase due to these trends in recent years. Historically, unemployment has been inversely related to restaurant sales and, as the unemployment rate decreases and disposable income increases, restaurant sales have increased. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014 was the first year food away from home dollars surpassed at-home dining, with 50.1% of food dollars spent on food away from home and with total expenditures increasing 4.8% from 2013. 

Quick-Service Restaurants. We operate in the hamburger category of the quick-service restaurant segment of the restaurant industry. Quick-service restaurants are distinguished by high speed of service and efficiency, convenience, limited menu and service, and value pricing. According to Nation's Restaurant News , 2014 U.S. foodservice sales for the Top 100 restaurant chains increased 4.6% from 2013 to $232.2 billion. Of this amount, the hamburger category represented $73.8 billion, or 31.8%, making it the largest category of the quick-service segment. 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias and other purveyors of moderately priced and quickly prepared foods. 

We believe that: 

&#8226; 

product quality and taste; 

&#8226; 

brand recognition; 

&#8226; 

convenience of location; 

&#8226; 

speed of service; 

&#8226; 

menu variety; 

&#8226; 

price; and 

&#8226; 

ambiance 

are the most important competitive factors in the quick-service restaurant segment and that our restaurants effectively compete in each category. We believe our largest competitors are McDonald's and Wendy's. 

Employees 

As of January 3, 2016 , we employed approximately 20,350 persons of which approximately 150 were administrative personnel and approximately 20,200 were restaurant operations personnel. None of our employees are 

are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.
