 Item 1. Business

Overview

Lifeloc Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Lifeloc" or the "Company"), is a Colorado-based developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable hand-held and fixed station breathalyzers and related accessories, supplies and education. We design, produce and sell fuel-cell based breath alcohol testing equipment. We compete in all major segments of the portable breath alcohol testing instrument market, including law enforcement, workplace, corrections, original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") and consumer markets. In addition, we offer a line of supplies, accessories, services, and training to support customers' alcohol testing programs. We sell globally through distributors as well as directly to users.

We define our business as providing "near and remote sensing" products and solutions. Today, the majority of our revenues are derived from products and services for alcohol detection and measurement. We remain committed to growing our breath alcohol testing business. In the future, we anticipate the commercialization of new sensing and measurement products that may allow Lifeloc to successfully expand our business into new growth areas where we do not presently compete or where no satisfactory product solutions exist today.

In addition, with the October 2014 purchase of our corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property, we added a new reporting segment focused on the ownership and rental of real property through existing commercial leases.

Lifeloc incorporated in Colorado in December 1983. We filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on May 31, 2011. Our fiscal year end is December 31. Our principal executive offices are located at 12441 West 49th Avenue, Unit 4, Wheat Ridge, Colorado 80033-3338. Our telephone number is (303) 431-9500. Our websites are www.lifeloc.com, www.lifeguardbreathtester.com and stsfirst.com. Information contained on our websites does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.

Principal Products and Services and Methods of Distribution

In 1989, we introduced our first breath alcohol tester, the PBA3000. Our Phoenix&#174; Classic was completed and released for sale in 1998, superseding the PBA3000. In turn, the Phoenix&#174; Classic has been superseded by our FC Series and Workplace Series of portable breath alcohol testers, which are discussed below. Neither the PBA3000 nor the Phoenix&#174; Classic is actively sold today.

&#160;

In 2001, we completed and released for sale an additional product line, our new FC Series, designed specifically for domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets. The portable breath alcohol testers comprising our FC Series are currently being sold worldwide, having contributed to our growth since their introduction. The FC Series is designed to meet the needs of domestic and international law enforcement for roadside drink/drive testing and alcohol offender monitoring. The FC Series is approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") as an evidential breath tester, making it suitable for sale to state law enforcement agencies for preliminary roadside breath alcohol testing. The FC Series is routinely updated with firmware, software and component improvements as they become available. It is readily adaptable to the specific requirements and regulations of domestic and international markets.

In 2005 and 2006, we introduced two new models, the EV30 and Phoenix&#174; 6.0 Evidential Breath Tester ("Phoenix&#174; 6.0"), which constitute our Workplace Series of testing devices. Like their predecessor, the Phoenix&#174; Classic, these instruments are also DOT approved. The DOT's specifications support the DOT's workplace alcohol testing programs, including those applicable to workplace alcohol testing for the federally regulated transportation industry. We also sell component parts used in alcohol testing devices, such as mouthpieces used by our breathalyzers, as well as forms and labels used for record keeping, and calibration products for user re-calibration of our devices. We offer optional service agreements on our equipment, re-calibration services, and spare parts, and we sell supporting instrument training and user certification training to our workplace customers.

In 2006, we commenced selling breath alcohol equipment components that we manufacture to other original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") for inclusion as subassemblies or components in their breath alcohol testing devices.

In late 2009, Lifeloc released the LifeGuard&#174; Personal Breathalyzer ("LifeGuard&#174;"), a personal alcohol breath tester that incorporates the same fuel-cell technology used in our professional devices. Intended for the global consumer breathalyzer market, LifeGuard&#174; is primarily sold directly to consumers in the U.S. and marketed internationally through global distributors. 

In 2011 and 2012 Lifeloc introduced Bluetooth wireless keyboard and printer communication options for our popular Phoenix&#174; 6.0 along with a series of web based workplace training courses. We believe these two product innovations have been key to our success and leadership in workplace breath testing.

In 2013 Lifeloc expanded our FC Series of professional breath alcohol testers targeted at domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets with the addition of the FC5 Hornet (the "FC5"). The FC5 is a passive (no mouthpieces required) portable handheld alcohol screening device that competes directly with passive alcohol screeners from our competitors in the education, law enforcement, workplace and corrections markets. In 2013 we also introduced the Sentinel&#8482; zero tolerance alcohol screening station, a fully automated wall mounted screening station for use in safety sensitive industries such as oil and gas and mining. Both devices expand Lifeloc's products for passive alcohol screening.

In the third quarter of 2014 we received approval from DOT for our EASYCAL&#174; automatic calibration station for use with Lifeloc Evidential Breath Testers, and we began shipments of the EASYCAL&#174; to our law enforcement, corrections, workplace and international customers. The EASYCAL&#174; is a first of its kind device that automatically performs breath tester instrument calibration, calibration verification and gas management. As compared to manual instrument calibration, the EASYCAL&#174; reduces the opportunity for human error, saves time and reduces operating costs.

In October 2014 we were awarded a $250,000 grant from the Colorado Office of Economic Development to accelerate development of a breathalyzer that tests for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent in cannabis. Terms of the grant require us to submit invoices as work is performed, with an anticipated completion date of August 31, 2017. This development effort is ongoing. They are included in our Statements of Income as reductions in Research and Development cost. No revenue has been recognized from these grant reimbursements. We received $47,947 and $25,000 of grant reimbursements in 2015 and 2014 respectively. There is no assurance that this effort to develop a THC breathalyzer will be successful or that significant sales will result from such development if successful.

&#160;

&#160;

On October 31, 2014, we purchased the commercial property the Company uses as its corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. The building consists of 22,325 square feet, of which 10,670 are currently leased to three tenants under leases that expire at various times ranging from June 30, 2016 to December 31, 2017. We intend to continue to lease the space we are not occupying, but in the future may elect to expand our own operations into space currently leased to other tenants. Our purchase of the property was partially financed through a term loan in an original principal amount of $1,581,106, secured by a first-priority mortgage on the property. The loan matures in November 2025.

In December 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Superior Training Solutions, Inc. ("STS"), a company that develops and sells online drug and alcohol training and refresher courses. The assets we acquired from STS complement our existing drug and alcohol training courses.

In October 2015 Lifeloc introduced our Sentinel&#8482; line with the Sentinel&#8482; VA alcohol screening station, a full automated station to control vehicular access to safety critical facilities, such as mines, refineries, power stations and nuclear facilities. All drivers entering a secure area can be tested quickly and efficiently.

Additional Areas of Interest

Consistent with our business goal of providing "near and remote sensing" products and solutions, our acquisition strategy involves purchasing companies, development resources and assets that are aligned with our areas of interest and that can further aid in our entering additional markets. We expect to actively research and engage in the acquisition of resources that can expedite our entrance into new markets or strengthen our position in existing ones.

Competition and Markets

We sell our products in a highly competitive market and we compete for business with both foreign and domestic manufacturers. Most of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do. In addition, there is an ongoing risk that other domestic or foreign companies who do not currently service or manufacture products for our target markets may seek to produce products or services that compete directly with ours.

We believe that competition for sales of our alcohol monitoring products and services is based on regulatory approvals, product performance, product delivery, quality, service, training, price, device reliability, ease of use and speed. We sell certain of our components to customers for incorporation into their own product lines and for resale under their own name. We believe that, while our resources are more limited than those of our competitors, we will continue to compete successfully on the basis of product innovation, quality, reputation and continued customer service excellence.

One leading competitor is Intoximeters, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, a long-established company with strong name recognition in the field of alcohol testing. It has well established sales channels, a large customer base, and a broad product line. CMI, Inc. of Owensboro, Kentucky, another major competitor, also has a well established name, strong position in stationary units used in police work, and international market coverage. Dr&#228;gerwerk AG &#38; Co. KGaA ("Dr&#228;ger"), based in Germany, manufactures safety and gas testing equipment. Its breath alcohol testers are respected for their quality and performance. 

In addition, other technologies for the measurement of breath alcohol exist and are employed in other market and application segments where the technology may be more suitable or developed to specific requirements. These include:

&#8226; Infrared devices, which use infrared light absorption to detect breath alcohol. These devices generally lack portability, and are usually found in fixed locations, such as police stations, where subjects are brought for testing. This technology has the advantage of being mandated by law in most states for evidential use in breath testing. 

&#160;

&#8226; Semiconductor breath testing technology, which is used primarily in consumer breathalyzers. Its primary advantage is low cost, but the technology is not widely accepted by professional users as being as accurate as fuel cell technology. 

&#8226; Chemical tests, which are based on urine and saliva testing. This approach to alcohol testing is more invasive, less convenient than breath testing, and may require subsequent analysis for results. 

&#8226; Blood alcohol tests, which require blood samples. These tests are widely believed to be the most accurate form of alcohol testing because they measure blood alcohol content directly from a sample of the subject's blood. However, the results are not instantaneous and the tests are more invasive and expensive than breath alcohol testing. 

Marketing

Marketing activities associated with our business include the communication of our value proposition through direct mail, direct and indirect sales channels, trade shows and an information-rich online presence. We sell our products to the workplace and international markets primarily through distributors. We sell our law enforcement, corrections and consumer products directly to the end user and our OEM products directly to manufacturers. Leveraging our installed base is important, as is maintaining a well trained distributor network. In 2009, we revised our workplace distributor program to place additional emphasis on volume incentives for growth in the form of a rebate program. Under the program distributors receive a progressively greater percentage rebate based on the dollar sales they generate. We believe this program helps incentivize our distributors to achieve a higher level of sales than would otherwise be the case.

Domestic Distribution

The majority of our sales into the workplace market are made through distributors. Sales are made by these distributors pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice, and such agreements typically grant protected lead generation areas.

International Distribution

Over 90% of our international sales for all product lines are made by local distributors, who are given territories generally pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice. Based on reports from our international distributors, we believe that many countries around the world are instituting tougher alcohol abuse prevention laws, strengthening the enforcement of current laws, or both. These laws set limits on the amount of alcohol an individual may have in the blood at specific times (e.g., while driving or during safety-sensitive work activities), or at any time for certain parolees and probationers. Lifeloc has sold instruments to customers in over 60 countries on six continents worldwide.

Research and Development

Lifeloc defines its business broadly to include "near and remote sensing" applications in markets outside of our traditional alcohol testing. We believe that our future success depends to a large degree on our ability to conceive and develop improved alcohol detection and measurement products, as well as to identify attractive opportunities for growth outside of breath alcohol testing. Accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in research and development. We spent $1,224,045 and $1,000,266 during 2015 and 2014, respectively, on research and development. The amount spent in 2015 was higher than the amount spent in 2014 because we increased our emphasis on new product development efforts for existing and new markets.

&#160;

&#160;

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers

A basic component of our instrument product line is the fuel cell, which we obtain from only a few suppliers. We believe that our demand for this component is small relative to the total supply, and that the materials and services required for the production of our products are currently available in sufficient quantities and will be available for the foreseeable future. However, there are relatively few suppliers of the high-quality fuel cells which our breathalyzers require. Any sudden disruption to the supply of our fuel cells would pose a significant risk to our business. New sources of fuel cells are uncertain at this time and changes to our fuel cells require approval by the DOT, which, if not received, could have a material effect on our revenues. While we have traditionally used only one supplier of fuel cells, we have recently developed fuel cells of our own manufacture. The manufacturing process for these fuel cells is still being developed, and upon satisfactory completion of this development, we intend to submit to the Department of Transportation for approval in our Evidential Breath Testers. If our own fuel cells are approved, Lifeloc will pursue a two-supplier strategy as necessary to meet the needs of the Company.

Patents, Intellectual Property and Royalties

We rely, in part, upon patents, trade secrets and proprietary knowledge as well as personnel policies and employee confidentiality agreements concerning inventions and other creative efforts (collectively, "Lifeloc IP") to develop and to maintain our competitive position. We do not believe that our business is dependent upon any patent, patent pending or license, although we believe that trade secrets and confidential know-how may be important to our commercial success. 

We file for patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our intellectual property rights to the extent practicable. We hold the rights to five United States patents and have four patent applications pending, along with international patent applications on our EASYCAL &#174; calibration station. These patents have expiration dates ranging from October 2020 to September 2031. In 2015 we filed two utility patent applications related to our volatile substance testing equipment and methods, and we amended two previous filings. We are not aware of any infringements of our patents. We act to protect our patents from infringement in each instance where we determine that doing so would be economical in light of the expense involved and the level and availability of our financial resources. While we believe that each of our pending applications relate to a patentable device or concept, there is no guarantee that the patents will be issued.

We also enter into royalty agreements from time to time. In 2012 we entered into a royalty agreement with an OEM customer which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer. The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the OEM customer upon six months&#8217; notice. In 2013 we began receiving royalties from another customer as a result of entering into a second royalty agreement, which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer. The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the customer upon six months&#8217; notice or by us upon 12 months notice.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 33 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment. Lifeloc sells cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen (UN1956, Class 2.2) for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers. The gas mixture is a hazardous material as defined by the DOT (see 49 CFR 172). We believe we are in substantial compliance with the appropriate DOT regulations for the handling and shipment of dry gas containers, as well as all other state or local laws governing the transportation of hazardous materials. The DOT regulations include strict labeling and packaging requirements, as well as requirements pertaining to shipping papers and declaration forms that must be completed by the shipper. In addition, we provide a Material Safety Data Sheet ("MSDS") with every tank, and all employees involved in shipping hazardous materials are required to have appropriate certification. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability, which could have a material impact on our business. The cost of complying with these regulations is considered as an ongoing cost of operations, and is not material.

Government Regulation of the Business

All breath testers sold in the United States explicitly for personal use are regulated as Class I medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). These regulations apply to the manufacture and sale of our LifeGuard&#174; product, and we are subject to inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with these regulations. FDA inspections are conducted periodically at the discretion of the FDA. As of December 31, 2015, we had not been inspected by the FDA; however, we believe we were in substantial compliance with applicable FDA regulations.

In connection with its production of cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers (described above under &#8220;&#8212;Environmental Matters&#8221;), Lifeloc has trained on and is following the requirements of OSHA's Hazardous Communications Standard of 2012 (referred to as "HazCom 2012"). Compliance with HazCom 2012 requires providing employee information and training, labeling of chemicals used by Lifeloc and updating MSDS to the new harmonized Safety Data Sheets ("SDS") as they become available. It also requires us to prepare and implement a hazard communication program to follow for workers potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals.

We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and by various state departments of transportation. The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines, and other transportation industries. The DOT Office of Drug &#38; Alcohol Policy &#38; Compliance ("ODAPC") publishes, implements, and provides authoritative interpretations of these rules. These regulations cover all transportation employers, safety-sensitive transportation employees, and service agents. Manufacturers submit devices to the DOT for testing and approval. Instruments are tested according to their model specifications and, if passed, included on the Conforming Products List of Evidential Devices published periodically in the Federal Register. Law enforcement applications also require that portable breath testing instruments be included on the DOT Conforming Products List. Lifeloc's FC10, FC20, EV30, Phoenix&#174; and Phoenix&#174; 6.0 are included on the conforming products list. We believe that we were in substantial compliance with the regulations described above as of December 31, 2015 for our products sold into these markets and states.

&#160;

See also Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; "We are subject to a high degree of regulatory oversight and, if we do not continue to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, our revenues may decline." 

International Regulations

Outside of the United States Lifeloc is subject to applicable regional and foreign regulations. In order to sell our products in the European Union, a CE mark is required which declares product conformity to relevant directives. Product directives include electromagnetic compatibility and environmental directives which restrict the use of certain hazardous substances in electronic equipment. Lifeloc has a number of CE marked products and we follow other foreign regulations as they apply.

Many countries into which our products are sold recognize the United States DOT Conforming Product list in their selection criteria or have no regulations applicable to the sale of our products. In the case of sales into countries that do not recognize the United States DOT Conforming Product list in their selection criteria, our products conform to in-country developed specifications or are not subject to significant government regulation.

&#160;

State and Local Regulations

Portable fuel-cell based technology has been used to show "probable cause" in many state jurisdictions, based on the individual device's DOT approval.

In certain states, the results of portable fuel-cell breath testers are admissible as evidence of intoxication in DUI prosecution. In other states, infra-red technology is considered the standard for evidence of intoxication, because of its ability to perform real-time analysis of the entire breath exhalation thereby giving it the ability to detect interference from mouth alcohol. In those states, portable fuel-cell based breath testers are not admissible as evidence of intoxication, although they may still be used to establish probable cause.

Insurance

We are covered under comprehensive general liability insurance policies, which have per occurrence and aggregate limits of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, and a $5 million umbrella policy. We maintain customary property and casualty, workers' compensation, employer liability and other commercial insurance policies.
