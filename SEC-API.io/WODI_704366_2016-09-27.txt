Corporate Background 

&#160;

Elite Data Services, Inc., (&#8220;DEAC&#8221;), formerly Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was incorporated in the State of Florida on November 23, 1981 as Mammathetics Corp. On November 4, 2013 the Board of Directors approved the proposal to change the name of the company from Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation to Elite Data Services, Inc. 

&#160;

From 1981 through the first quarter of 2011, the Company&#8217;s business was that of a marketer of tumor detection equipment. On March 9, 2011, the Company shifted its focus to the recoverable energy sector. In 2013, the Company transitioned its operations to offering web-based marketing services for the automotive industry through owned and operated online platforms. Further, in 2014, the Company acquired licensing and distribution rights to operate gaming machines in Honduras and Roatan.

&#160;

Today, the Company is a technology driven management company which owns and operates online marketing and gaming businesses. The Company is currently comprised of two (2) subsidiaries: Elite Data Marketing LLC, and Elite Gaming Ventures LLC. 

&#160;

On August 26, 2016, the Company and the controlling shareholders of WOD Market LLC ("WOD"), a Colorado limited liability company (&#8220;WOD&#8221;), executed a definitive agreement (the "WOD Definitive Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the ownership interest in WOD, a Colorado based provider of intelligent retail solutions for gym owners and coaches, in the form of three (3) separate closings, the first closing on the date of executions, the second closing on or before September 15, 2016, and the third and final closing on or before October 15, 2016, subject to certain terms and conditions more fully described under Subsequent Events in Item 12 herein.

Overview of Business and Operations 

&#160;

Online Marketing Platforms 

&#160;

On January 13, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Baker Myers and Associates, LLC (&#8220;Baker Myers&#8221;) to acquire certain assets including, www.classifiedride.com, an online classified listing website where private sellers can buy, sell, and trade their vehicle. ClassifiedRide provides a classified listing platform where users list their vehicle, truck, boat (i.e. anything that has a motor) to the Company&#8217;s website (either by free or paid listing options). The main premise of the website is to aid the private seller in selling or trading their vehicle. The Company, in turn, then works as the community leader to establish relationships between buyers and sellers using social media platforms and consumer customer support incentives. These relationships are used to generate revenue from private sellers, dealerships, affiliate lead providers, and third party advertisers. 

&#160;

On January 15, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Baker Myers LLC for 51% of the membership interest of Autoglance, LLC, a Tennessee Limited Liability Company, and with it majority control over all owned assets of Autoglance, LLC, including the website www.autoglance.com (collectively &#8220;Autoglance&#8221;) for 765,000 shares the Company&#8217;s common stock as consideration. Autoglance is a search engine of used cars that prioritizes and compares inventory in individualized markets by displaying the best deals first while hiding listings that are older, more expensive, and have more mileage. Autoglance currently has a provisional patent for this method of organizing and displaying vehicles. More specifically, Autoglance&#8217;s invention group&#8217;s vehicles of the same make and model in a market location to determine the best price based on the market value of the vehicle. Vehicles that are deemed worse deals are hidden from the user. The user cans easily see hidden cars if he/she wishes by the click of a button.

&#160;

Gaming Operations 

&#160;

On April 4, 2015, the Company entered into a Agreement and Promissory Note (the &#8220;Note&#8221;) with H y H Investments, S.A. (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;) for the purchase of all outstanding securities of El Muerto Beauty Mineral, Sociedad Anonima (hereafter &#8220;EMBM&#8221;) whose sole asset consists of a license to operate 80 gaming machines in La Lima, 80 gaming machines in Trujillo, and 160 gaming machines in Roatan, the largest of the bay islands of Honduras. The Company entered into contract to acquire the shares of EMBM and not the license directly as the license is in the name of EMBM. The total purchase price for the license was Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) payable in the form of a Promissory Note (the &#8220;Note&#8221;). The Company tendered $100,000 as a non-refundable good-faith deposit under the terms of the Note that is applicable towards the purchase price which allows permitted use of EMBM&#8217;s assets as long as we are in good standing in regards to our payments as further discussed below. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the first Amendment, the Company owes no further obligation under the terms of the Note until April 6, 2016, at which time $900,000 is due to the Seller, payable in the form of cash or shares of common stock of the Company at the option of the note holder. If the seller elects to convert such payment or a portion of such payment into shares, the value of the shares will be assessed at the average closing price of the common stock of the Company for the five trading days immediately proceeding April 6, 2016. If the Seller elects to receive cash, and we do not have the cash on hand to satisfy the obligation, pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Seller has the right to terminate the entire Agreement, unwind the transaction and assume ownership of the EMBM shares if the Company is unable to negotiate an extension or alternate arrangement. The remaining balance under the Note is payable up to $2,500,000 per year thereafter through March 31, 2021 by either cash payments or by a revenue-share of 25% of the net revenues received by EMBM during such time period. In the event that Seller has not received the full amount due on or before March 31, 2021, such amount due may be payable via the issuance of the Company&#8217;s shares at the average closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding March 31, 2021. Beginning on or after April 17, 2017, payments tendered in the Company&#8217;s common stock may be repurchased by the Company given the Seller&#8217;s approval. The Seller agreed to waive interest payments of 3.85% per annum, due in monthly installments, in exchange for a sub-license granting the Seller usage of twenty-five (25) machines in the municipality of Roatan.

&#160;

On June 30, 2015, the Company amended the Note to reflect an effective date of April 6, 2016 in conjunction with the first payment of Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) which is due in either cash, stock, or 25% of the net revenues of EMBM&#8217;s operations. The Note was also amended to reflect the current purchase price owed ($9,900,000) April 6, 2016, which deducts the $100,000 non-refundable deposit tendered on April 6, 2015. The business purpose for this amendment was to allow the Company the proper time to incorporate a Honduras corporation to be in compliance with the laws of the Republic of Honduras to effectively be able to transact business in that municipality. 

&#160;

The license permits operation and/or distribution of gaming machines at different locations as follows: Eighty (80) gaming machines in La Lima, Eighty (80) gaming machines in Trujillo, and One Hundred and Sixty (160) gaming machines in Roatan, the largest of the bay islands of Honduras.
