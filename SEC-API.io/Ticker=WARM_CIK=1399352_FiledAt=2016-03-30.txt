Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated on July 22, 2002 in the State of Nevada under the name Bibb Corporation. On September 3, 2010, we changed our name to Z3 Enterprises, Inc. ("Z3"), and on April 5, 2012, to HPEV, Inc. ("HPEV") and on August 19. 2015 our stockholders voted to approve a name change to Cool Technologies, Inc. Our 95% owned subsidiary, Ultimate Power Truck, LLC ("UPT"), was formed on April 17, 2014 in the State of Florida. 

&#160;

On March 29, 2011, we entered into a share exchange agreement (which was amended on June 14, 2011) with HPEV, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("the Share Exchange Agreement") to acquire 100 shares, constituting all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPEV, Inc. in consideration for the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock. Upon closing of the share exchange on April 15, 2011, HPEV, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary. There was a change of control of our company on April 15, 2011 as a result of the issuance of 21,880,000 shares of our common stock to the original shareholders of HPEV, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. An additional 120,000 shares were issued during the fourth quarter of 2011 which completed the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of common stock under the terms of the amended Share Exchange Agreement. 

&#160;

As of March 21, 2016, we have five patents and seven US patent applications pending in the area of composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications (commonly referred to as 'thermal' or 'heat dispersion technology') and a parallel vehicle power platform. We also have a Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") application filed for a heat pipe cooled brake system. The Company intends to commercialize our patents by licensing our thermal technologies and applications to electric motor, pump and vehicle component manufacturers; by licensing or selling a mobile electric power system powered by the Company's proprietary gearing system to commercial vehicle and fleet owners; and by licensing a plug-in hybrid conversion system for heavy duty trucks, buses and tractor trailers to fleet owners and service centers.

Business Description 

&#160;

We have developed and are commercializing dispersion technologies in various product platforms, and have developed and are commercializing an electric load assist technology around which we have designed a vehicle retrofit system. In conjunction, we have applied for trademarks for one of our technologies and its acronym. The Company currently has one trademark in the application process: TEHPC. 

&#160;

We believe that our proprietary technologies, including our patent portfolio and trade secrets, can help increase the efficiency and affect manufacturing cost structure in several large industries beginning with motor/generator and fleet vehicles. 

&#160;

The markets for products utilizing our technology include consumer, industrial and military markets, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our initial target markets include those involved in moving materials and moving people, such as:

&#160;

Our Technologies 

&#160;

Our technologies are divided into three distinct but complementary categories: heat dispersion technology, mobile electric power and electric load assist. 

&#160;

Heat Dispersion Technology 

&#160;

Heat is an undesirable byproduct of anything that moves, especially motors and generators. Historically, a large percentage of the cost of manufacturing any motor has been in the technology necessary to remove heat during its operation to prevent failure and increase power. Heat can destroy motors, generators and many other types of machinery, and the energy necessary to remove heat can limit output. 

&#160;

Our patented thermal dispersion technology removes heat via composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture. Heat pipes have been utilized for more than 50 years, but we have a proprietary process and design technology that makes our heat pipes usable in many applications that have previously not been effective. The key is that our heat pipes move heat in any direction in a system that requires little or no maintenance and can be applied to almost any motor, generator or industrial product. We believe that this allows for more efficient, smaller, and higher output machines, resulting in cooler motors and a longer operating life. 

&#160;

Our patent portfolio covers the application and integration of our heat pipes into various cooling schemes for enhanced heat removal in motors, generators and numerous other industrial applications including marine, aviation and military. We believe that our technologies have the potential to deliver power output increases and cost reductions, depending on the machine type or motor/generator size, as follows: 

&#160;

1. Increase power density of current motor platforms by 20% to 40%,

2. Reduce total product cost by 12.5% to 25%,

3. Increase motor and generator efficiency by 1% to 2%, and

4. Increase motor and generator life.

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160;

We also believe that products produced with our technologies have the potential to deliver operational savings as well, including savings from: 

&#160;

- 

reduced maintenance costs,

- 

the standardization of multiple platforms down to a single platform,

- 

the standardization of drawings and data around existing platforms,

- 

the ability to use standard designs and standard insulation systems versus customization, and

- 

the ability to integrate and produce on existing production lines with no retooling and no additional, or minimal, capital investment.

&#160;

Recent tests by independent laboratories showed a 200% increase in horsepower capability for a dry pit submersible pump and a 25 to 35% increase in power density for a 650 kVA alternator. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; &#160;

On December 6, 2013, ESSCO Pumps and Controls, a member of the Hydraulic Institute, conducted the tests in accordance with standards set forth by the Institute. The tests examined the tolerances of an industrial electric motor in an extreme situation. The tolerances determine the amount of power that can be driven through pumps run by the motor and are a strong predictor of the maintenance and other service downtime the pump will require. The original pump motor is rated to run, without submersion, for up to 15 minutes before the pump's protective circuits will turn it off to prevent overheating. This heat limitation restricts the output of the motor. The test pump used the same industrial electric motor, except with Cool Tech's thermal dispersion technology incorporated. The result: the test pump ran without submersion for more than two hours at or above full power without reaching critical temperatures that would have caused an automatic shutdown. 

&#160;

On December 13, 2013, Mohler Technology, Inc. of Boonville, Indiana completed tests of an alternator enhanced with our thermal technology. A 650kVA alternator (generator) was run at full load to test its operational limits. The heat produced by generators of that size must be removed or controlled in order for the alternator to operate effectively. Manufacturers' current best practice is to add either a liquid cooling system or an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of the generators. 

&#160;

The alternator tested used our thermal technology with no other cooling of any kind. The results showed a minimum of 25% improvement in power density over the manufacturer's rating for the alternator when operating without water cooling. In fact, the alternator achieved power densities comparable to a liquid-cooled or over-framed one. 

&#160;

The tests confirmed our belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex water-cooled system. Extrapolating the results leads us to believe that simple designs incorporating our thermal technology combined with the increase in potential output will result in lower costs to manufacture by reducing the amount of material needed to produce a product with a specific output. 

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2015, Kato Engineering, a business unit of Emerson Electric, conducted two heat run tests. The tests were performed at a 0.8 power factor and tested rated load temperature using the Emerson LS 625KVA generator with and without the Cool Technologies heat dispersion system. The CoolTech results were then compared with results of tests performed at a 0.8 power factor using the generator's standard-issue, totally enclosed water-to-air cooled (TEWAC) system. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

A comparison of all test results produced by the various testing agencies revealed a minor variance in some readings. A plan has been designed to optimize our technology to produce consistent results within a specific parameter. This should enable an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to offer our technology as an option . 

&#160;

The successful testing also represents a significant advance in our product development agreements with manufacturing partners. We anticipate that we will begin to enter into license agreements upon completion of the required design refinements and field tests testing to industry or governmental standards. At this point, the product will be ready to be manufactured on the licensee's regular production line. Any additional field tests will be at the discretion of the licensee. 

&#160;

We also plan to incorporate heat pipes in vehicle components which generate heat such as brake calipers, resistors and rotors. The new brake components should be incorporated in the initial conversion vehicle. 

&#160;

Our revenue model for the heat dispersion technology is to license the technology in exchange for royalties. 

&#160;

Mobile Power Generation 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Company has a proprietary gearing system, which is used to power an on-board generator, eliminating the need for some commercial vehicles to tow a mobile generator to a work site. Management believes that there is a need for on-board, continuous generation of up to 200 kilowatts (kW) of power to remote jobsites, as well as mobile generation of emergency power in the event of an outage or disaster. We intend to offer an on-board generator installation kit as a stand-alone (Mobile Generator) for third parties and as part of an in-house brand (Ultimate Work Truck). 

&#160;

Company management, along with key directors and members of the Board of Advisors have utilized Q1 of 2016 to do extensive market research, interview prospective customers, hold up-fitter meetings and perform channel to market evaluation. They have put the plans in place to ensure that we have proper coverage for upfront sales, specification influence, full up-fitting capabilities with aftermarket parts and service as we launch our MG30-MG80 products in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

Our revenue model for Mobile Generation will be driven by the efforts of direct regional sales teams and independent reps along with partner up-fitters and truck body builders. 

&#160;

In head-to-head competition with tow behind generators, our mobile generation technology should prove very disruptive. Operators in such markets as utility, telecom and tree service, to name a few, will be able to work in remote locations without having to tow or drop in a generator. The reduction in overall weight and size should also deliver significant operating efficiencies and savings to work truck fleets. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Electric Load Assist Technology 

&#160;

We have also developed proprietary Electric Load Assist ("ELA") technology. The technology is the centerpiece of our vehicle retrofit system (separate and apart from our heat pipe technology and heat dispersion product development partnerships), which also relies on the benefits of heat removal by composite heat structures and heat pipe architecture and is protected by patents and patents-pending. 

&#160;

With ELA, a vehicle engine does not have to work as hard, as some of the work that was done by the engine is now performed by an electric motor running in parallel. The vehicle still drives and feels the same, and our ELA controller allows full acceleration and braking control; however, the engine runs much more efficiently and burns significantly less fossil fuel. The ELA controller allows the vehicle operator to determine the amount of load assist during operation, ranging from all-fuel to all-electric. We believe that our ELA system will provide a significant difference and improvement from, and competitive advantage over, current market offerings such as the Toyota Prius. If either the electrical system or the internal combustion engine fails, an ELA vehicle can operate on the remaining system. In current market offerings, if either system fails, the vehicle fails. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

We believe our ELA technology is compatible with any manufacturer as well as any power source, including traditional gasoline/diesel engines, compressed natural gas, batteries and fuel cells. We also believe that our technology will have a wide range of marine, aviation, industrial and military applications. 

&#160;

Initially, we plan to implement a simple version of our ELA system technology for on-board mobile auxiliary power, which we anticipate will generate revenue from transport companies and other businesses which own and/or manage fleets of Class 2, 3, 4 and 6 or light to medium-duty trucks. Our revenue model for the ELA technology will be to license the technology in exchange for royalties based on fuel savings. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Heat Dispersion Technology 

&#160;

Cooling solutions to remove or control heat produced by industrial electric motors, generators and alternators are provided by the manufacturers. Their current best practices are based on technology that's over 50 years old. They either add a liquid cooling system to the motor or build an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of their products. 

&#160;

The Company is not aware of any new alternatives on the market. 

&#160;

Mobile Electric Power (MG30-MG80) 

&#160;

Other companies use a vehicle's engine to charge on-board batteries, which then run the generator when the vehicle is stopped. While this eliminates idling, output tends to be less than 50 kW and lithium-ion batteries typically power the system. The batteries have limited runtimes and a shorter lifespan than acid batteries. In addition, they must be cooled to operate properly. Two companies dominate belt driven systems: Aura Systems, Inc. and Mobile Electric Power Solutions, Inc. ("MEPS"). Their systems use a vehicle's engine to power a generator and produce electricity whenever the engine is running. The interface to the vehicle is under the hood via a separate belt system. Both are very efficient, capable of delivering th e rated power at or near the engine's idle revolutions per minute ("RPM"). According to Aura Systems' 2014 annual report filed on Form 10-K, the Aura Systems system is over 80% efficient at the low RPM range and is approximately 75% efficient at the very high RPM range. Aura Systems offers an axial-plus style motor and control that outputs up to approximately 16 kW. It must be noted, however, that Aura Systems, a public company, has fallen behind on its reporting and is no longer current. 

&#160;

MEPS uses the alternator to power a belt-driven system that provides up to 15 kW. Both provide clean power to operate sophisticated electronic equipment. MEPS delivers alternating current ("AC") power, whereas Aura Systems proves both AC and direct current ("DC"). 

&#160;

A variety of engine or transmission-based electrical power take-off systems also provide exportable power. They tend to output small amounts like 7 kW of 110/220 volt power. 

&#160;

Management believes that the Company can compete in the mobile electric power market because there is a need for on-board generators, as opposed to trailer-mounted generators towed behind a vehicle. A primary benefit will be that the under-chassis installation will allow a truck to tow other trailers and equipment, however, we anticipate that the greatest selling point will be value. In comparison to the purchase price of new Doosan towable generator, we believe we can provide up to 200 kilowatts ("kW") of auxiliary mobile power to any location for less than half the production cost of a towable, trailer-mounted generator, which may weigh over 10,000 pounds. We intend to deliver the same power at under 3,000 pounds. Our Mobile Generation system will also offer the same features of a tow behind generator including single and three phase outputs as well as a full function generator panel with enhanced capabilities including a touchscreen, digital controls and optional telematics. A full description of all our anticipated features and benefits can be found on our website under the menu heading "Mobile Electric Power". 

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; &#160;

Our target markets will initially center on industries and entities that rarely or never unhook their tow-behind generators from their work trucks. In industry parlance, they are always plugged in. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe our competition in the mobile generator market will be from well-established companies such as Cummins, Caterpillar, Doosan, WackerNeuson , Multi Quip and Generac. All of them offer towable, trailer-mounted generators. Only Cummins Onan offers an onboard generator and it's specifically engineered for mobile emergency vehicle use. 

&#160;

Portable generators also address a need for mobile electric p ower in the commercial, leisure and residential markets . As outputs tend to range from 1 to 20 k ilowatts , the competition they provide is only at the lowest end of Cool Technologie's power output spectrum and only from the higher power, higher quality and higher price commercial level units . Onan, Honda and Kohler are among the well - established b rand names in the market . There are more than 40 -manufacturing companies in the U.S that produce portable generators. Vehicle companies are also working to provide customers and partners with exportable power in conjunction with the development of hybrid vehicles. According to a January 2013 press release from VIA Motors, Inc., the company worked with Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the leading subsidiary of PG&#38;E Corporation, to convert two GM trucks into plug-in hybrids that export 15 kW of power for about $400,000, and is now working to boost that to 50 kW. VIA Motors plans to produce them commercially with prices in the $70,000 range, according to a January 2012 article in Forbes.com. 

&#160;

Electric Load Assist Technology 

&#160;

While the new hybrid electric vehicle industry is intensely competitive and features several multi-national companies such as Ford, GM, Toyota, Volvo and Honda, we believe that the market for hybrid conversions is in its infancy. There are a number of small companies, such as EVDrive, Inc, selling do-it-yourself conversion kits for individual vehicles. XL Hybrids, Inc. offers hybrid conversions through aftermarket installers for specific van, delivery and shuttle vehicles. EV Power Systems, Inc. is involved in conversions for fleet vehicles. Workhorse Group Inc. is the holding company for AMP Electric Vehicles which manufactures electric drives for class 3-6 commercial trucks. Wrightspeed Inc. offers replacement electric drive trains for high fuel consumption vehicles. VIA Motors, Inc. is offering conversions of a GM pick-up, van and SUV. XL Hybrids technology features a bolt-on retrofit kit that attaches to the drive train and adds lithium ion batteries and a controller. To our knowledge, no other company is involved in developing and commercializing ELA technology in a parallel platform or an aftermarket commercial platform. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; &#160;

ALTe Powertrain Technologies and Eaton Corporation are converting commercial vehicles by replacing the entire power-train, including the engine, transmission, fuel tank and drive shaft. We intend to perform conversions by adding standard components along with a patented thermal-engineered traction motor and the patent-pending electric load assist. 

&#160;

We aim to compete in the fleet markets for currently-owned vehicles. 

&#160;

We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include, but are not limited to: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

technological innovation; &#183;product quality and safety;

&#160;

&#183; 

product performance; and

&#160;

&#183; 

price.

&#160;

To a limited extent, we will compete against new hybrid vehicles if a fleet owner has a vehicle that is near the end of its useful life elects to purchase a new hybrid vehicle rather than upgrade with a conversion to a plug-in hybrid. However, it may still be cost effective for the fleet owner to purchase a new vehicle and then add a conversion depending on the added cost for a new hybrid versus the conversion cost. 

&#160;

Some of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to changes in the marketplace, whether as a result technological, economic or customer requirements or preferences. 

&#160;

Some of our potential competitors are significantly larger than we are, have been in business much longer than we have, and have significantly more resources at their disposal. That enhances their ability to obtain top engineering talent as well as sales representatives with strong industry ties. Plus, their greater market clout could effectively overwhelm our promotional and marketing efforts. 

&#160;

Equipment 

&#160;

As a company that intends to commercialize or license its proprietary technology for others to install, manufacture and/or distribute, our equipment needs are project specific and temporary. We do not intend to purchase any production equipment to implement our business operations, but instead we will rent, lease or outsource as needed. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We do not plan to manufacture in-house. The Company plans to partner with manufacturers utilizing their assets and system integrators to up-fit our Mobile Generation technology. For our thermal technologies, the Company plans to rely on product development agreements with manufacturers who will then pay a license or royalty per unit. We anticipate that such agreements will delineate the respective intellectual property owned by both companies, describe the goal of the testing to verify the savings and value to a particular company, the equipment to be modified, the criteria that constitute successful testing, how and where the tests will be conducted and the next steps to be taken in the event of successful t esting. For plug-in, hybrid conversions, the Company plans to use off-the-shelf and made-to-order equipment combined with proprietary software owned by the Company and created specifically for use on our parallel platform. To that end, the Company has sourced and priced electric motors, generators and other components as well as software programming. We hope installations will be performed by licensees of our ELA technology, but we currently have no license agreements. 

&#160;

Suppliers 

&#160;

For mobile power generation, the required software and its vehicle integration will be supplied by Inverom Corporation along with partner truck up-fitters. 

&#160;

Production level quantities will be handled by KATO Engineering, a brand manufactured by Emerson Industrial Automation, a division of Emerson Electric Company, with a backup of multiple other sources, if needed, such as Regal Beloit, Generac, etc. As for a supplier of our PPIG gearing system, our company has identified and is working with both North American and Asian partners. The balance of the components will be obtained from a number of other suppliers. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 

&#160; &#160;

For the thermal technology applications in electric motors, Thermacore, Inc. will supply the heat pipes and mechanical structure, which combine to make the heat exchangers. We will coordinate with Thermacore to combine our thermal technology with Thermacore technology in the creation of heat exchangers. 

&#160;

For dry pit submersibles, the wound stator and the rotor-shaft will be purchased from Nidec Motor Corporation or other partner sources such as Baldor Electric, Regal Beloit and others. The fully-machined castings will be purchased from the Quality Castings Company, located in Orville, Ohio. These components will then be assembled and tested by Consulting Point, Inc. located in Brownsville, Texas or another partner assembler in the USA. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we have no licenses or contractual rights in place to protect our technology and intellectual property, only patents or patents pending. 

&#160;

As of March 8, 2016, we own five US patents and have seven patent applications pending in the area of composite heat structures, motors, and related structures, heat pipe architecture, applications and a parallel vehicle platform We also have a Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") application filed for a heat pipe cooled brake system. In addition, w e have applied for a trademark for an acronym for one of our technologies: "TEHPC". 

&#160;

Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may also rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. 

&#160;

We strive to protect such proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. The Company has a policy of not disclosing its patent applications in order to protect the underlying technology. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth the patents we own or license which we believe support our technology.

Government and Industry Regulation 

&#160;

We intend to conduct business worldwide and, therefore, we must comply with local, state, federal, and international regulations, both in operations and for our products. 

&#160;

As a company, we do not plan to manufacture any of our products. Therefore, the government regulations we will be subject to will be limited to storage and involve rotating the shafts of stored electric motors on a regular basis. 

&#160;

Applicable laws and regulations include those governing, among other things, the handling, storage and transportation of materials and products as well as noise and employee safety. 

&#160;

In keeping with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations, the company has established a drug and alcohol policy; set up administrative procedures for recordkeeping, reporting, releasing information, and certifying compliance; provided our sole employee holding a commercial drivers' license with the necessary educational materials and training; and enrolled him in a random drug and alcohol testing program. 

&#160;

&#160; 12 

&#160; &#160;

In addition, some of our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, emissions and fuel requirements. 

&#160;

Accordingly, we may be required or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product or environmental safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications. 

&#160;

Although we believe that our operations and products are in material compliance with current applicable regulations noted within this section, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. New regulations could also require our licensees to redesign their products which could cause us to redesign our technologies which, consequently, could affect market growth for our products. 

&#160;

As our thermal technologies are incorporated in existing motors, generators and other manufactured products that are already subject to regulation. The regulatory burden will fall on the original equipment manufacturers that license our technology. 

&#160;

In addition to an existing generator incorporating CoolTech thermal technology, the stand-alone version of our auxiliary mobile power system will include a specialized gearing package, which connects the drive train to a generator that will be added on-board. We believe that the vehicle and drive train will operate normally in accordance with manufacturer's specifications and that no regulations will be violated or exceeded as well. Nonetheless, in some markets, the Company will have to certify that it meets federal, state or local noise and emission regulations. 

&#160;

The most significant regulatory burden the Company will face will be upon our hybrid conversion systems. All hybrid conversions must comply with Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") emission standards. 

&#160;

Any change to the original configuration of an EPA certified vehicle, including alternative fuel conversion, may be a potential violation of the Clean Air Act prohibition against tampering. Exemption from the tampering prohibition may be available by demonstrating that emission controls in a converted vehicle will continue to function properly and that pollution will not increase as a result of conversion. 

&#160;

Our designs comply with EPA emission standards and we believe they will comply with future requirements including the new fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards set to take effect in 2016.

The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") is charged with writing and enforcing safety and fuel economy standards for motor vehicles through their Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These standards require manufacturers to design their electrically powered vehicles so that, in the event of a crash, the electrical energy storage, conversion, and traction systems are either electrically isolated from the vehicle's chassis or their voltage is below specified levels considered safe from electric shock hazards. Our products will be designed to meet or exceed these requirements. 

&#160;

The Company intends to add an electric load assist on a parallel platform to motor vehicles. No original vehicle parts will be significantly modified in the conversion process. There will be some additional parts (motor, drive, battery and sensors and controls) added, but these parts will not change how the vehicle operates in any way. Although we will be adding power directly to the rear wheels, the rest of the drive train will operate according to the manufacturer's specifications. Therefore, we believe that the original warranty will remain in effect and we do not believe that the conversion will violate the Magnuson-Moss Act. 

&#160;

The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that protects consumers by barring a vehicle manufacturer from voiding the warranty on a vehicle due to an aftermarket part unless the manufacturer can prove that the aftermarket part caused or contributed to the failure in the vehicle. 

&#160;

All of our other components (motor, drive, batteries, controller/sensors) will be warranted by their respective manufacturers. 

&#160;

In addition, the total weight of the additional components should remain within the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating. As a result, we believe that our conversions will be in compliance with federal and state transportation regulations.

While we do not create and market our products around government subsidies and tax incentives, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act reauthorized the tax credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property until December 31, 2016. An MG truck equipped with a charger can provide a Level II charge to one or more electric vehicles. Our 200 kVA truck will enable Level III DC fast charging capability. Assuming the MG truck qualifies as a charging station, it would be eligible for a tax credit of the smaller of 30% of the vehicle's cost or $30,000. 

&#160;

If we fulfill all elements of our business plan, we will have to prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products will have to comply with the current emission standards that went into effect in the European Union last year as well as the standards in other international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China that are becoming more stringent. 

&#160;

Our ability to comply and to help licensees comply with these and future fuel standards is an essential element in establishing a leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results.

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 21, 2015, we had four full time employees and no part time employees. We hope to hire additional employees, on an as-needed basis, subject to sufficient funding, as products and services are developed. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

During 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development costs of $824,711 and $1,518,807, respectively. Such costs were not borne directly by customers.
