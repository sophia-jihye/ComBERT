 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We provide data analytics based specialized behavioral health management and treatment services to health plans through our On Trak program. Our On Trak program is designed to improve member health and at the same time lower costs to the insurer for underserved populations where behavioral health conditions are causing or exacerbating co-existing medical conditions. The program utilizes proprietary analytics, member engagement and patient centric treatment that integrates evidence-based medical and psychosocial interventions along with care coaching in a 52-week outpatient program. Our initial focus was members with substance use disorders. In the second quarter of 2015, we expanded our program into anxiety disorders, and we have plans to expand into other behavioral health conditions for depression. We currently operate our On Trak programs in Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin, and our On Trak for anxiety program in Kansas. We provide services to commercial (employer funded), managed Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid populations. 

&#160; &#160; 

We have not been profitable since our inception in 2003 and may continue to incur operating losses for at least the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2015, these conditions raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

&#160; 

We believe that our business and operations as outlined above are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, the healthcare industry is highly regulated, and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures, courts, enforcement and regulatory authorities. Only a treating physician can determine if our On Trak program is appropriate for any individual patient. Our future prospects are subject to the legal, regulatory, commercial and scientific risks outlined below and in Item 1.A &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Substance Dependence 

&#160; 

Scientific research indicates that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning, but they can also have long-lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used. Data indicates that at some point changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence&#8212;a chronic, relapsing and sometimes fatal disease. Those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without effective treatment. Professional medical treatment may be necessary to end this physiologically-based compulsive behavior. 

&#160; 

Substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth. Substance dependence disorders affect many people and have wide-ranging social consequences. In 2014, an estimated 20.0 million adults in the United States (U.S.) met the criteria for substance dependence according to the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe the best results in treating substance dependence can be achieved in programs such as our On Trak program that integrate psychosocial and medical treatment modalities and provide longer term support on an out-patient basis. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Anxiety Disorder 

&#160; 

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting an estimated 18% of adults, or approximately 43 million people age 18 years or older. People with anxiety disorders are: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Three to five times more likely to go to the doctor; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders. 

&#160; 

Mood Disorder 

&#160; 

In 2013, an estimated 15.7 million U.S. adults aged 18 or older, or approximately 6.7% of all U.S. adults, had at least one major depressive episode in the past year according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Patients with substance dependence and mood disorders were ranked four out of the top 10 reasons leading to readmission rates for Medicaid patients. 

&#160; 

Our Market 

&#160; 

The true impact of behavioral health is often under-identified by organizations that provide healthcare benefits. The reality is that individuals with behavioral conditions: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

are prevalent in any organization; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

cost health plans and employers a disproportionate amount of money; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

have higher rates of absenteeism and lower rates of productivity; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

have co-morbid medical conditions which incur increased costs for the treatment of these conditions compared to a non-substance dependent population. 

&#160; 

When considering substance dependence-related costs, many organizations have historically only looked at direct treatment costs&#8211;usually behavioral claims. The reality is that substance dependent individuals generally have overall poorer health and lower compliance, which leads to more expensive treatment for related, and even seemingly unrelated, co-occurring medical conditions. In fact, of total healthcare claims costs associated with substance dependence populations, the vast majority are medical claims and not behavioral treatment costs. 

&#160; 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014, there were over 283 million lives in the U.S. covered by various private managed care programs including Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), self-insured employers and managed Medicare/Medicaid programs. Each year, based on our analysis, approximately 1.9% of commercial plan members will have a substance dependence diagnosis, and that figure may be lesser or greater for specific payors depending on the health plan demographics and location. A smaller, high-cost subset of this population drives the majority of the claims costs for the overall substance dependent population. For commercial members with substance dependence and a total annual claims cost of at least $7,500, the average annual per member claims cost is $27,500, compared with an average of $3,250 for a commercial non-substance dependent member, according to our research. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers provide health insurance to individuals or groups (Contracted Membership). We contract with our customers to provide our On Trak program to the customers&#8217; Contracted Membership generally in specific lines of business (e.g., commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and/or specific states or other geographical areas and for specific indications, such as substance use disorders and, more recently, anxiety. We refer to the Contracted Membership to whom we are providing the On Trak program as Covered Lives. Generally, we receive data relating to the Covered Lives on a regular basis from our customers. We use that data to identify members who meet our contractual eligibility requirements (Eligible Members) and we attempt to engage and enroll those members in our On Trak program. Our Eligible Members can fluctuate significantly month to month due to fluctuations in our customers&#8217; Contracted Membership and changes in eligibility due to changes in claims or eligibility data provided to us by our customers. Based on our analysis of the data provided to us by our customers, approximately 0.045% of the adult Contracted Membership in a commercial line of business is anticipated to be eligible for our On Trak substance use disorder program. Based on our analysis, Medicare and Medicaid lines of business average approximately 2.5 times the number of Eligible Members for our On Trak substance use disorder program as the same number of Covered Lives in a commercial line of business. Further, as we move into On Trak programs for anxiety and depression, our preliminary data analysis shows that adding anxiety and depression indications to our Covered Lives is anticipated to increase our pool of Eligible Members substantially. Based on the latest data provided by our customer that has contracted for us to provide On Trak for anxiety, adding the anxiety and depression indications are anticipated to increase the number of Eligible Members by approximately four times over substance use disorders alone. There are fluctuations in the number of Eligible Members across customers and geographies. Our analysis to date is based on limited data, and in some cases like anxiety and depression, very limited data. There can be no assurance that the data we have analyzed to date will be predictive of the future or that the portion of Covered Lives that are eligible for our programs will not change in the future. In addition, the percentage of Eligible Members in any lines of Covered Lives may fluctuate substantially from period to period. 

&#160; 

Our Solution: On Trak 

&#160; 

On Trak &#8482; 

&#160; 

Our On Trak program combines evidence based medical and psychosocial treatments with elements of population health management and ongoing member support to help health plans treat members with substance dependence, anxiety and depression to improve member health and lower the overall health plan costs of these members. We believe the benefits of our On Trak program include improved clinical outcomes and decreased costs for the payor, and improved quality of life and productivity for the member. 

&#160; 

We believe On Trak is the only program of its kind. The On Trak program was developed by addiction experts with years of clinical experience in the substance dependence field. This experience has helped to form key areas of expertise that we believe sets our solution apart from other solutions, including member engagement, working directly with the member treatment team and a more fully integrated treatment offering. 

&#160; 

Our On Trak program includes the following components: identification of impactable members, member engagement, enrollment/referral, provider network, outpatient medical treatment, outpatient psychosocial treatment, care coaching, monitoring and reporting, and our proprietary web-based clinical information platform (eOn Trak ). 

&#160; 

We assist health plans to identify those members who incur significant costs and may be appropriate for enrollment into On Trak . We then engage and enroll targeted members into our program through direct mailings and telephonic outreach, and referral through health plan sources. After enrollment, our contracted specially trained network of providers provide treatments utilizing integrated medical and psychosocial treatment modalities, including our proprietary On Trak therapy modules for anxiety, depression and substance use disorders to help members develop improved coping skills and a recovery support network. Throughout the treatment process, our care coaches work directly with members to keep them engaged in treatment by proactively supporting members to enhance motivation, minimize lapses and enable lifestyle modifications consistent with the recovery goals. We also link providers and care coaches to member information through our eOn Trak , web-based clinical information platform, enabling each provider to be better informed with a member&#8217;s treatment in order to assist in providing the best possible care. Periodically, we will provide outcomes reporting on clinical and financial metrics to our customers to demonstrate the extent of the program&#8217;s value. 

&#160; 

Clinical and financial outcomes from the On Trak program have been promising with On Trak enrolled members achieving an average gross cost reduction of more than 50% as measured from the 12 months prior to enrollment. In addition, to date, approximately 80% of members who have remained eligible have been retained in the program. 

&#160; 

On Trak 

&#160; 

Our proprietary On Trak program is designed to improve treatment outcomes and lower the utilization of medical and behavioral health plan services by high utilizing and high risk enrollees. Our On Trak program includes medical and psychosocial interventions; a proprietary web based clinical information platform and database, psychosocial programs and integrated care coaching services. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Another important aspect of the Catasys program is that the program is flexible and can be altered in a modular way to enable us to partner with payors to meet their needs. As a service delivery model, the On Trak program can be modified to cover particular populations and provide for varying levels of service. In this way On Trak can work with payors to identify, engage and treat a broader spectrum of patients in a way that is consistent with payors&#8217; business needs. 

&#160; 

Our value proposition to our customers includes that the On Trak program is designed for the following benefits: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

A specific program aimed at addressing high-cost conditions by improving patient health and thereby reducing overall healthcare costs can benefit health plans; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Increased worker productivity by reducing workplace absenteeism, compensation claims and job related injuries; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Decreased emergency room and inpatient utilization; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Decreased readmission rates; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Healthcare cost savings (including medical, behavioral and pharmaceutical). 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is to provide a quality integrated medical and behavioral program to help health plans and other organizations treat and manage health plan members whose behavioral health conditions are exacerbating co-existing medical conditions resulting in increased in-patient medical costs. Our initial focus was members with substance use disorder. During 2015, we expanded our program into anxiety disorders, and we have plans to expand into other behavioral health conditions for depression. 

&#160; 

Key elements of our business strategy include : 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Demonstrating the potential for improved clinical outcomes and reduced cost associated with using our On Trak program with key managed care and other third-party payors; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Educating third-party payors on the disproportionately high cost of their substance dependent population; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Providing our On Trak program to third-party payors for reimbursement on a case rate, fee for service, or monthly fee basis; and 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Generating outcomes data from our On Trak program to demonstrate cost reductions and utilization of this outcomes data to facilitate broader adoption. 

&#160;

As an early entrant into offering integrated medical and behavioral programs for substance dependence, we believe we will be well positioned to address increasing market demand. We believe our On Trak program will help fill the gap that exists today: a lack of programs that focus on smaller populations with disproportionately higher costs driven by behavioral health conditions that improve patient care while controlling overall treatment costs. 

&#160; 

Our Operations 

&#160; 

Healthcare Services 

&#160; 

Our On Trak program combines innovative medical and psychosocial treatments with elements of traditional disease management, case management, and ongoing member support to help organizations treat and manage populations struggling with substance dependence, depression, and anxiety to improve their health and thereby decrease their overall health care costs. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As of March 29, 2016, we have contracts for our On Trak program with seven health plans, two of which have merged and are in the process of integrating operations and an additional one has been acquired pending regulatory approval. We are enrolling patients under all seven of these contracts. 

&#160; 

We are currently marketing our On Trak program to managed care health plans on a case rate, monthly fee, or fee for service basis, which involves educating third party payors on the disproportionately high cost of their substance dependent population and demonstrating the potential for improved clinical outcomes and reduced cost associated with using our program. 

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160; 

We have discontinued our license and management fees segment. The operations were shut down effective April 1, 2014 and all of the assets were absorbed by the Company. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Healthcare Services 

&#160; 

Our On Trak program to date has focused primarily on substance dependence and is marketed to health plans and other insurance payers. While we believe our products and services are unique, we operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with other healthcare management service organizations and disease management companies, including managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) that manage behavioral health benefits, perform utilization reviews, provide case management and patient coaching, and pay their network of providers for behavioral health services delivered. Most of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We compete with companies such as Hummingbird, One Health Solutions, and Health Integrated that offer coaching, social media, and in the case of Health Integrated, more comprehensive products to address the costs of members with substance dependence and other behavioral health conditions. One Health Solutions, a behavioral change technology and social networking site for people in recovery, has conducted a pilot with a national health plan that purported to show a reduction in in-patient readmissions for substance dependence treatment and has reported a pilot with a large managed behavioral health organization that has exceeded expectations on duration and frequency of participant engagement. We believe our product is the most comprehensive to focus exclusively on substance dependence and focus on the overall health and cost of members. 

&#160; 

In addition, managed care companies may seek to provide similar specialty healthcare services directly to their members, rather than by contracting with us for such services. Behavioral health conditions, including substance dependence, are typically managed for insurance companies by internal divisions or third-parties (MBHOs) frequently under capitated arrangements. Under such arrangements, MBHOs are paid a fixed monthly fee and must pay providers for provided services, which gives such entities an incentive to decrease cost and utilization of services by members. We compete to differentiate our integrated program for high utilizing substance dependence members, which seeks to increase treatment and impact the overall health care costs of the members, from the population utilization management programs that MBHOs offer to manage a health benefit. 

&#160; 

We believe that our ability to offer customers a comprehensive and integrated solution, including the utilization of innovative medical and psychosocial treatments and engagement methodologies, and our unique technology platform will enable us to compete effectively. However, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter more effective competition in the future, which would limit our ability to maintain or increase our business. 

&#160; 

Once we contract with a third-party payor we implement our program in conjunction with the third party payor and then commence outreach to eligible members to enroll them in our On Trak program. In this enrollment process we compete against numerous other providers of behavioral health treatment programs, facilities and providers for those members that elect to receive treatment for substance dependence (see Treatment Programs below). We believe we provide members lower cost and more comprehensive solutions, but members may choose to receive care from other providers. To the extent a member selects a different provider that is part of a health plan network of providers, the cost of such treatment may be paid in whole or in part by our health plan customer. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Treatment Programs 

&#160; 

There are over 14,000 facilities reporting to the SAMHSA that provide substance dependence treatment. Well-known examples of residential treatment programs include the Betty Ford Center&#174;, Caron Foundation&#174;, Hazelden&#174; and Sierra Tucson&#174;. In addition, individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices. Many of these traditional treatment programs have established name recognition. 

&#160;
