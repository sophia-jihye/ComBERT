Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company principally focused on developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro&#8482; (bucindolol hydrochloride), is a pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are evaluating in a clinical trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, or AF, in patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFREF. We have identified common genetic variations in receptors in the cardiovascular system that we believe interact with Gencaro&#8217;s pharmacology and may predict patient response to the drug. 

We are testing this hypothesis in a Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical trial of Gencaro, known as GENETIC-AF. We are pursuing this indication for Gencaro because data from a prior Phase 3 HF trial of Gencaro in 2,708 heart failure, or HF, patients, or the BEST trial, which suggested that Gencaro may be successful in reducing or preventing AF. 

AF is a disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart&#8217;s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular and uncoordinated. The irregular contraction pattern associated with AF causes blood to pool in the atria, predisposing the formation of clots potentially resulting in stroke. In addition, AF increases the risk of stroke and may also contribute to worsening heart failure. 

AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33.5 million. According to the 2016 American Heart Association report on Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, the estimated number of individuals with AF in the United States in 2010 ranged from 2.7 million to 6.1 million people. The approved therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain disadvantages in HFREF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects, and most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. We believe there is an unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects than currently available therapies and are more effective, particularly in HFREF patients. 

We believe data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF, whereas we believe the therapeutic benefit of Toprol XL does not appear to be enhanced in patients with this genotyp e. A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that the entire cohort of patients in the BEST trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In the BEST DNA subst udy, patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF when receiving Gencaro, based on the same analysis. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the U.S. general population. 

&#160;

GENETIC-AF is a Phase 2B/Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, adaptive design clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the beta-blocker Toprol XL (metoprolol succinate), that seeks to enroll a combined total of approximately 620 patients. Eligible patients will have HFREF, have a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and have the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality. The combined Phase 2B/Phase 3 trial is designed for 90 percent power at a p-value of less than 0.01 significance level to detect a 25 percent reduction in the primary endpoint for patients in the Gencaro arm compared to patients in the Toprol XL arm. A subset of patients in the trial will also undergo continuous heart rhythm monitoring to assess AF burden, which is defined as the amount of time per day that a patient experiences AF. These data will be collected via newly or previously implanted Medtronic devices capable of assessing AF burden (for example, implantable loop recorders, pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices). The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States and Canada.

&#160;

The GENETIC-AF Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, will conduct a pre-specified interim analysis of study endpoints for efficacy, safety and futility to recommend whether the trial should proceed to Phase 3. The DSMB will make its recommendation based on a predictive probability analysis of certain trial data after at least 150 patients have evaluable endpoint data. An enrolled patient has evaluable endpoint data either when they experience their first endpoint event, or after they complete the 24-week follow up period. The DSMB interim analysis will focus on analyses of the AF/AFL endpoints in the trial using both clinical-based intermittent monitoring and device-based continuous monitoring techniques. Should the DSMB interim analysis indicate that the data are consistent with pre-trial statistical assumptions and the potential for achieving statistical significance for the Phase 3 endpoint, the DSMB may recommend that the study proceed to Phase 3. The DSMB may also halt the study for futility. Based on the current enrollment rate, we expect to enroll at least 150 patients by the end of 2016. We expect the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation regarding the potential transition to Phase 3 in the first half of 2017. In February 2016, we amended the trial protocol to allow for up to 250 patients to be enrolled in the Phase 2B portion of the trial, which is intended to enable the study to continue enrolling patients while the DSMB interim analysis is underway. Should the DSMB recommend that the study proceed to Phase 3, the trial would continue enrolling to a total of approximately 620 patients (i.e., up to 250 patients in Phase 2B and 370 patients in Phase 3), subject to our obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Phase 3 portion of the trial.

In March 2015, the GENETIC-AF protocol was revised to expand the target study population. Previously, the protocol required patients to have persistent AF at the time of screening to be eligible. Under the revised protocol, patients in sinus rhythm who have experienced symptomatic AF are eligible for inclusion in the trial, as are patients with paroxysmal AF. We believe this expanded target population has improved trial screening and enrollment rates and could broaden the potential commercial market for Gencaro, should it achieve regulatory approval in the future. In February 2016, the GENETIC-AF protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe these modifications will facilitate site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and potential sites in European countries, where we anticipate expanding the study to support both the later portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3 portion of the trial. We believe inclusion of European investigative sites may support potential European regulatory submissions and partnering discussions. We received no objections from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and Health Canada on the protocol amendments prior to their implementation. As such, we believe that these changes do not fundamentally alter or impact previous regulatory agreements. 

Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro requires a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient&#8217;s receptor genotype. We have an agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC-AF trial. LabCorp has developed the genetic test and obtained an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA for the companion diagnostic test which is being used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 

Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, the world&#8217;s largest medical technology company, is collaborating with us on the GENETIC-AF trial. Under the collaboration with Medtronic, ARCA is conducting a substudy that includes continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythms in a subset of patients enrolled during the trial. The collaboration is administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic uses its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices and the data will be used by the DSMB as part of the interim analysis. Medtronic will support the reimbursement process for U.S. patients enrolled in the Phase 2B portion, and will provide financial support of unreimbursed costs for a certain number of U.S. patients in the Phase 2B portion up to a certain maximum amount per patient. If GENETIC-AF proceeds to Phase 3, we will continue to enroll additional patients, with Medtronic devices for monitoring and recording AF burden, in the substudy. Medtronic will provide the 

agreed upon CareLink System cardiac rhythm data collection and analysis for the Phase 3 portion of the substudy and support the reimbursement process. 

We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing, which, if we are granted patent term extension, may provide market exclusivity for these uses of Gencaro into approximately 2030 in the United States and Europe. 

To support the continued development of Gencaro, in June 2015, we completed a private placement that raised approximately $34.2 million of net proceeds as additional funds for the Phase 2B portion of the GENETIC-AF trial and to support our ongoing operations. We are seeking to enroll up to 250 HFREF patients in the Phase 2B portion of the GENETIC-AF trial, and we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through at least the end of 2017. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. If we proceed to the Phase 3 portion of GENETIC-AF, we will be required to raise additional funds.

On September 3, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to implement a seven-for-one reverse split of our common stock, as previously authorized and approved at our annual meeting of stockholders on June 22, 2015. On September 4, 2015, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on a post-split basis. 

The reverse split effected a proportionate adjustment to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our existing stock option plans were reduced proportionately. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse split, and stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to a fractional share received in lieu thereof, a cash payment based on the closing sale price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market on September 3, 2015. The reverse split did not alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock. 

Our Strategy 

Our mission is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing cardiovascular therapies with an emphasis on genetically-targeted therapies. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advance the development of Gencaro. We plan to focus our efforts on completing the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Raise additional funding or complete a strategic transaction. To support the continued clinical development of Gencaro, including the GENETIC-AF clinical trial, we expect to seek additional funding, through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, or the completion of a strategic transaction. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Build a cardiovascular pipeline. Our management and employees, including our chief executive officer, have extensive experience in cardiovascular research, molecular genetics and clinical development of cardiovascular therapies. We are seeking to leverage this expertise to identify, acquire and develop other cardiovascular products or candidates, with an emphasis on pharmacogenetic applications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Leverage our existing assets. We are pursuing opportunities to leverage certain of our development-stage product candidates. These opportunities include collaborations with institutions conducting proof of concept studies and government funded development. 

Atrial Fibrillation Market Background and Opportunity 

AF is a disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart&#8217;s two small upper chambers becomes irregular and uncoordinated. The irregular contraction pattern associated with AF causes blood to pool in the heart&#8217;s atria, predisposing to the formation of clots. These clots may travel from the heart and become lodged in the arteries leading to the brain and other organs, thereby blocking necessary blood flow and potentially resulting in stroke. In addition, we also believe that the development of AF in a HFREF patient can be associated with increased risk of death and other heart failure related adverse outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33.5 million. According to the 2016 American Heart Association report on Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, the estimated number of individuals with AF in the United States in 2010 ranged from 2.7 million to 6.1 million. The approved therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain disadvantages in HFREF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects, and most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. We believe there is an unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects than currently available therapies and are more effective, particularly in HFREF patients. 

The goals of current medical therapy for AF are to maintain sinus rhythm or to control ventricular rate response in patients who cannot maintain sinus rhythm, in an effort to mini mize patient symptoms and avoid the risk of complications such as stroke. Current treatments include pharmaceutical intervention and device intervention. There are several antiarrhythmic drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment and/or prevention of recu rrent AF. However, these drugs have safety and/or administration concerns and all but one have contraindications or label warnings regarding their prescription in patients with HFREF. 

Current device interventions for the treatment of AF include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Electrical cardioversion which is used to restore normal heart rhythm with administration of a direct current shock; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Radiofrequency ablation which is effective in some patients for whom medications are ineffective; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Atrial pacemakers which are implanted under the skin and then intravenously into the heart to regulate heart rhythm. 

Gencaro 

Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is a pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the treatment of AF. Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2, receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents the receptor from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, which activate these receptors. We believe that Gencaro is well-tolerated in cardiovascular patients because of its mild vasodilator effects. Originally developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Gencaro, bucindolol hydrochloride, has been tested clinically in approximately 4,500 patients. Gencaro was the subject of a Phase 3 HF mortality trial in 2,708 patients, mostly in the United States, or the BEST trial. The BEST trial included a DNA bank of over 1,000 patients, which was used to evaluate the effect of genetic variation on patients&#8217; response to Gencaro. 

At the time of the BEST trial, our scientific co-founders, Dr. Michael Bristow and Dr. Stephen Liggett, hypothesized that the unique pharmacologic properties of Gencaro would interact with common genetic variations of beta-1, beta-2 and alpha-2C, adrenergic receptors, which are important receptors that regulate cardiac or adrenergic (sympathetic) nerve function. They tested this hypothesis prospectively in a substudy conducted using data from the BEST DNA bank. On the basis of this study, Drs. Bristow and Liggett have determined that patients with certain variations in these receptors had substantially improved outcomes on primary and certain secondary clinical endpoints in the trial, such as mortality, HF progression, hospitalization and prevention of arrhythmias, relative to the counterpart genotype groups and the general patient population of the BEST trial. We believe that these genetically determined receptor variations, which are detectable using standard DNA testing technology, can serve as diagnostic markers for predicting enhanced therapeutic response to Gencaro, and potentially avoiding adverse events, in individual patients. We have patented our methods for treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro in the United States and Europe based on genetic testing. 

Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics 

Gencaro&#8217;s pharmacology appears to be different from other compounds in the beta-blocker class in two fundamental respects. First, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, or NHLBI, and the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs sponsored studies conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett indicated that in human myocardial preparations, Gencaro leads to inactivation of constitutively active (i.e. functional in the absence of bound agonist) beta-1 receptors through a mechanism separate from beta-blockade, in addition to inhibiting the binding activity of the beta-1 receptor like a typical beta-blocker. Second, other studies, including BEST, indicated that Gencaro lowers the systemic levels of the neurotransmitter NE, released by cardiac and other adrenergic nerves. These two properties interact with common genetic variations in two cardiac receptors, the beta-1 and alpha-2C receptors, to produce the unique pharmacogenetic profile of Gencaro. We believe that these two properties, and their pharmacogenetic implications, are unique to Gencaro. 

Gencaro has an important interaction with the beta-1 receptor found on muscle cells, or cardiac myocytes, of the heart. The general role of the beta-1 receptor and its downstream signaling cascades is to regulate the strength and rate of the heart&#8217;s contractions. NE serves as an activator of the beta-1 receptor, causing the receptor to initiate signaling to the cardiac myocyte. Although this signaling may be beneficial to the failing heart in the short term, in chronic HFREF patients the beta-1 receptor also initiates harmful, or cardiomyopathic, signaling which, over time, exacerbates the heart&#8217;s structural and functional decline. Beta-blockers counteract this destructive process by reducing beta-1 receptor signaling. They do this by binding to the receptor and blocking NE molecules from binding and activating the signaling activity and, in Gencaro&#8217;s case, by also inactivating certain beta-1 receptors that are constitutively active (active in the absence of NE stimulation) as well as by lowering NE levels. 

There are two common genetic variations of the beta-1 receptor, each of which we estimate is present in approximately 50% of the U.S. population. One of these variations is known as the beta-1 389 arginine receptor variant, exclusively present in the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous or, genotype. Laboratory studies indicate that this variation results in a higher functioning beta-1 receptor, which has a greater ability to mediate the stimulatory effects of NE than the counterpart &#8220;beta-1 389 glycine or &#8220;beta-1 389 Gly&#8221; version of 

the beta-1 receptor. In addition, the beta-1 389 arginine variant is also more likely to be constitutively active and signal the cardiac myocyte to contract in the absence of NE. The beta-1 389 arginine receptor also h as much higher affinity for NE as compared to the beta-1 389 glycine version, present in patients with either one or two copies of the beta-1 389 glycine gene allele, or Gly carriers. Patients with the beta-1 389 glycine version, also present in approximat ely 50% of the U.S. population who are Gly carriers, results in a beta-1 receptor that is much lower functioning and, according to laboratory studies, has less probability of being in a constitutively active state and has lower NE affinity compared to the beta-1 389 arginine receptor. 

We believe Gencaro has a powerful interaction with the higher-function beta-1 389 arginine variation of the beta-1 receptor. Laboratory studies show that constitutively active receptors will continue to signal in the presence of standard beta-blockade with neutral antagonists. Laboratory studies in isolated human heart preparations also show that Gencaro has the novel ability of being able to reduce the signaling of constitutively active receptors. We believe that this property contributes to the enhanced lowering of heart failure and arrhythmia event rates in HFREF patients who are beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype relative to individuals who are beta-1 389 Gly carriers or to the general population. In addition, we believe the unique NE lowering properties of Gencaro have a selectively beneficial effect in patients who have only beta-1 389 arginine receptors, because of the high affinity of these receptors for NE. 

The efficacy of Gencaro also appears to be influenced by the alpha-2C receptor, located on the terminus of cardiac adrenergic nerves, at the neuromuscular junction with the cardiac myocyte. The role of this receptor is to modulate the release of NE at this junction, which in turn affects the activation of beta-1 receptors and the heart&#8217;s activity. There are two important genetic variations of this receptor that appear to affect the effects of Gencaro; the &#8220;alpha-2C -wild type&#8221;, which is the normal functioning version of the receptor (approximately 87-90% of the U.S. general population), and the &#8220;deletion variant&#8221;, a version of the receptor that functions poorly (present in at least one copy in approximately 10-13% of the U.S. general population). The DNA substudy of patients from the BEST trial, conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett, indicated that these two variations of the alpha-2C receptor appear to affect Gencaro&#8217;s heart failure and arrhythmia responses in HFREF patients only if the 389 Gly variant of the beta-1 receptor is also present; in patients with the beta-1 389 Gly variant, the wild type version of the alpha-2C receptor enhances clinical response, whereas the alpha-2C deletion variant reduces efficacy. When only the arginine version of the beta-1 receptor is present (beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), the efficacy of Gencaro does not appear to depend on which version of the alpha-2C receptor is present. 

The DNA substudy from the BEST HFREF trial indicated that the combinations of these receptor variations in individual patients appear to influence the response to Gencaro with respect to significant clinical endpoints. However, the beta-1 389 Arg/Arg variant appeared to have the most powerful beneficial effect on Gencaro heart failure and arrhythmia responses. While we believe that the beta-1 389 Gly carrier patients who also are alpha-2C wild type homozygotes may respond favorably to Gencaro, we believe that patients who possess only the beta-1 389 arginine variant (beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype) exhibit enhanced clinical responses to Gencaro, and should be the primary targeted population. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype constitutes an estimated 47-50% of the U.S. population. 

The BEST trial 

The NHLBI and Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies funded BEST trial began in 1995. It was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of bucindolol&#8217;s effect on reduction of mortality and morbidity in an advanced chronic HFREF population. The primary endpoint of the BEST trial was all cause mortality, or ACM, and the pre-specified main secondary endpoint was progression of HF, defined as death from HF, cardiac transplant, HF hospitalization, or emergency room visit for the treatment of worsening HF not requiring hospitalization. The trial was planned to run four and one-half years, and enroll 2,800 patients. The trial enrolled a total of 2,708 chronic HF patients, who were mostly from the United States. Under the umbrella of the BEST trial substudies program, a DNA bank and substudy was created, and 1,040 of the BEST patients participated by providing blood for DNA analysis. The DNA bank provided data for the DNA substudy of BEST patients conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett. 

In 1999, the BEST trial was terminated prior to the completion of follow-up, in response to a recommendation of the BEST trial DSMB. The primary reason for termination was loss of investigator equipoise; in other words, the fact that the BEST investigators were no longer uncertain regarding the comparative therapeutic merits of giving a placebo versus giving a beta-blocker to a HFREF patient. Positive mortality results from two other HF trials involving other beta-blockers had been reported, and a substantial number of BEST trial investigators concluded that it was unethical to continue to give placebo to BEST trial participants. As a result, some investigators began to prescribe these other beta-blockers to patients in the trial, which threatened to destroy the trial&#8217;s integrity; therefore the trial was terminated early. 

Clinical Results and the DNA Substudy 

Following termination, the preliminary results of the study were analyzed and published. The preliminary determination and general perception were that the BEST trial had failed on the basis of not meeting its primary endpoint of ACM. The published values were a 10% risk reduction in mortality with a p-value of 0.10. Subsequently, we reanalyzed the results from BEST, in accordance with the FDA approved, pre-specified statistical analysis plans, which had not been performed by the sponsors of BEST when the trial was terminated. Our reanalysis appeared to show a 13% risk reduction on the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality in the BEST trial with a p-value of 0.053. 

In 2003 and 2004, the results of the DNA substudy conducted by Drs. Bristow and Liggett began to be analyzed and released. The DNA substudy results indicated a significant enhancement of response on the major heart failure clinical endpoints from the BEST trial in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. The risk reduction on HF clinical efficacy endpoints such as mortality and hospitalization ranged from 34% to 48% in this genotype. In addition, in arrhythmia endpoints of atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia, or VT/VF, tracked by adverse events, or AEs, and surveillance electrocardiograms, or ECGs, the risk reduction by bucindolol in the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype appeared to be even greater, with risk reductions of 74% for both endpoints. 

Shown below are certain of the primary and secondary endpoint data from the BEST HF DNA substudy results, by genotype:

Analysis of BEST trial for AF 

The BEST study data were further analyzed focusing on AF prevention, rate control in patients with established AF, and on clinical outcomes of patients with AF. Although there was no pre-determined AF endpoint, including reduction in risk of AF, in the BEST trial, according to our analysis of adverse events and surveillance ECG&#8217;s during the trial, 7.9% of patients developed new onset AF, with a greater incidence observed in the placebo group (9.7%) compared to the bucindolol group (6.2%). This corresponded to a 36% reduction in the incidence of new onset AF (based on crude event rates) for patients receiving bucindolol (p = 0.002). In a time to event analysis, the risk of new onset AF was reduced by 41% (p = 0.0004) with bucindolol treatment. Patients in the BEST study with the beta-1 389 Arg/Arg genotype who received Gencaro had a 74% reduction in the risk of developing new onset AF (p = 0.0003). 

Further published analyses of the data from BEST suggest that Gencaro may also have potential efficacy for other clinical endpoints and outcomes related to AF. A published analysis of the BEST data revealed that of the 303 patients in the BEST trial with established AF, 67% of those who received Gencaro achieved ventricular response rate control, defined as a resting heart rate of less than or equal to 80 beats per minute without symptomatic bradycardia (p &#60; 0.005). In AF patients who achieved ventricular response rate control, Gencaro produced a 39% reduction (p = 0.025) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations. In addition, Gencaro also improved cardiovascular clinical endpoints for those AF patients possessing the beta-1 389 arginine genotype that ARCA believes is most favorable for Gencaro response. In a substudy of 1,040 patients in BEST in which patient genotypes were analyzed, Gencaro was associated with a 72% decrease (p = 0.039) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations in those 52 AF patients in the substudy with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. 

Analysis of th e BEST Study data also shows that Gencaro has potential efficacy against the serious arrhythmias of VT/VF, which also appears to be genetically regulated. A published report demonstrated that patients in the BEST Trial who received Gencaro experienced a 58 % reduction in the incidence of VT/VF (p = 0.00006), adjusted for the competing risk of mortality. In addition, the authors of this report determined that Gencaro reduced the incidence of VT/VF by 74% (p = 0.00005) in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. 

As with the overall study cohort, most patients (89%) in the 1,040 patient DNA substudy were free of AF (91% sinus rhythm, 9% other non-AF rhythms) at baseline. The proportion of patients free of AF at baseline was also similar in the two treatment groups for the overall DNA substudy cohort, as well as in the beta-1 389 genotype subgroups. In the BEST DNA substudy, the proportion of patients who developed new onset AF was similar compared to the overall study cohort for both the placebo group (11% and 10%, respectively) and the Gencaro group in the DNA substudy population compared to the overall study cohort (7% and 6%, respectively). Also, there was a similar reduction in new onset AF observed in the bucindolol group compared to placebo (43% and 41%, respectively, by time to event analysis). Therefore, the overall results from the genetic substudy population are consistent with the results from the overall study population. 

In patients with all genotypes, the AF risk reduction of 41-43% by Gencaro in BEST is based on an analysis of adverse events and surveillance ECG&#8217;s which was similar to AF risk reductions observed in a meta-analysis of data regarding seven placebo-controlled beta-blocker trials in HFREF patients. In the meta-analysis, beta-blockers appeared to reduce the incidence of new onset AF in all but one trial, with an overall relative risk reduction of 27%. Despite what we believe to be potential evidence for the prevention of AF in HFREF trials, no beta-blocker has FDA approval for use in this indication. However, the evidence of modest efficacy by beta-blockers approved for other indications will require that any Phase 3 trials with Gencaro will have an active beta-blocker comparator instead of a comparison against placebo. The Phase 2B/Phase 3 trial GENETIC-AF trial will only enroll patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. In the BEST trial, the post hoc analysis of patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who received Gencaro had a 74% reduction in the risk of developing AF. In another trial, the active comparator we are using in GENETIC-AF, metoprolol CR/Toprol XL, reduced the risk of developing AF by 48% in all genotypes. Because these are not the same trials, the results should not be relied on as direct comparisons. However, we believe that these two data points indicate that Gencaro may have an advantage in preventing AF when compared to metoprolol in GENETIC-AF, in part due to our plan to only enroll beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype patients who appear to respond best to Gencaro. 

Clinical and Regulatory Strategy 

The regulatory strategy for Gencaro is to conduct our adaptive design Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical trial, GENETIC-AF, to obtain an AF approval in a genotype specific HFREF population. We are enrolling certain patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype in our AF clinical trial because our analysis of the BEST DNA substudy indicated this group had a 74% reduction in risk for new AF events. 

We have created an adaptive design for GENETIC-AF. We are seeking to enroll up to 250 HFREF patients in the Phase 2B portion of the study. The GENETIC-AF DSMB will conduct a pre-specified interim analysis of study endpoints for efficacy, safety and futility to recommend whether the trial should proceed to Phase 3. The DSMB will make its recommendation based on a predictive probability analysis of certain trial data after at least 150 patients have evaluable endpoint data. Should the DSMB interim analysis indicate that the data are consistent with pre-trial statistical assumptions and the potential for achieving statistical significance for the Phase 3 endpoint, the DSMB may recommend that the study proceed to Phase 3. The DSMB may also halt the study for futility. In February 2016, we amended the trial protocol to allow for up to 250 patients to be enrolled in the Phase 2B portion of the trial, which is intended to enable the study to continue enrolling patients while the DSMB interim analysis is underway. Should the DSMB recommend that the study proceed to Phase 3, the trial would continue enrolling to a total of approximately 620 patients (i.e., up to 250 patients in Phase 2B and 370 patients in Phase 3), subject to our obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Phase 3 portion of the trial. 

We have received guidance from the FDA regarding our Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical study comparing Gencaro to Toprol XL for the prevention of AF in approximately 620 patients. Based on this FDA guidance, we believe that a successful GENETIC-AF Phase 3 clinical trial, with a p-value of less than 0.01, could be sufficient evidence of efficacy upon which to base a New Drug Application, or NDA, for the approval of Gencaro for an AF indication in HFREF patients. Our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for atrial fibrillation, under which our GENETIC-AF trial is performed, has been accepted by FDA and is active. In March 2015, the GENETIC-AF protocol was revised to expand the target study population. Previously, the protocol required patients to have persistent AF at the time of screening to be eligible. Under the revised protocol, patients in sinus rhythm who have experienced symptomatic AF are eligible for inclusion in the trial, as are patients with paroxysmal AF. We believe this expanded target population has improved trial screening and enrollment rates and could broaden the potential commercial market for Gencaro, should it achieve regulatory approval in the future. In February 2016, the GENETIC-AF protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe these modifications will facilitate site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and potential sites in European countries, where we anticipate expanding the study to support both the later portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3 portion of the trial. We believe inclusion of European investigative sites may support potential European regulatory 

submissions and partnering discussions. We received no objections from the United S tates Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and Health Canada on the protocol amendments prior to their implementation. As such, we believe that these changes do not fundamentally alter or impact previous regulatory agreements. 

In April 2015, the FDA designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in a genetically targeted heart failure population (heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) as a Fast Track development program. 

Fast Track drug development designation was included in the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, as a formal process to enhance interactions with the FDA during drug development. A drug development program with Fast Track designation is eligible for consideration for some or all of the following programs for expediting development and review: scheduled meetings to seek FDA input into development plans, priority review of the NDA the option of submitting portions of an NDA for review prior to submission of the complete application and potential accelerated approval.

The Gencaro Test 

If approved, we believe that Gencaro will be the first cardiovascular drug to be integrated with a companion diagnostic to predict enhanced efficacy. We believe the drug label we will propose for Gencaro would identify the patient receptor genotype studied in the trial that can expect enhanced efficacy and, and that the label would recommend receptor genotype testing prior to initiation of therapy. Therefore, the commercialization of Gencaro may require an FDA approved diagnostic test for this genotype be available, or the Gencaro Test. We believe the Genaro Test could be developed and commercialized through a preferred diagnostic provider, by the company marketing Gencaro, or a combination of approaches.

For our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, we have an agreement with LabCorp to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support the trial. To provide those services, LabCorp has developed the genetic test and obtained from the FDA an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, for the companion diagnostic test we use in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 

Licensing and Royalty Obligations 

We have licensed worldwide rights to Gencaro, including all preclinical and clinical data from Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Engineering Consultants, LLC, or CPEC, who has licensed rights in Gencaro from BMS. In addition, we have sublicensed CPEC&#8217;s rights from BMS. CPEC is a licensing entity which holds the rights of the biotechnology companies that were the commercial sponsors of the BEST trial. If the FDA grants marketing approval for Gencaro, the license agreements state that we are required to make a milestone payment of $8.0 million within six months after FDA approval. The license agreements also state that we are required to make milestone payments of up to $5.0 million in the aggregate upon regulatory marketing approval in Europe and Japan. The licenses state that our royalty obligations range from 12.5% to 25% of revenue from the related product based on achievement of specified product sales levels including a 5% royalty that CPEC is obligated to pay BMS. The agreements state that we have the right to buy down the royalties to a range of 12.5% to 17% by making a payment to CPEC within six months of regulatory approval. We also have licensed worldwide rights to intellectual property covering the pharmacogenetic response of Gencaro based on the cardiac receptor polymorphisms, which is owned by the University of Colorado. We have no material future financial obligations under this license. We also have licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize diagnostics for these receptor polymorphisms, for the purpose of prescribing Gencaro, from the licensee of these rights, the University of Cincinnati. 

Development Pipeline 

Our development activities are substantially focused on our lead product candidate, Gencaro, for the treatment of AF. We also believe, based upon data from the BEST trial, that Gencaro may have additional potential for the treatment of AF rate control, VT/VF and prevention of heart failure endpoints in HFREF patients. We do not expect to pursue development of Gencaro for disease indications beyond AF without entering into a strategic partnership or collaboration. We believe Gencaro has potential to address these additional indications, and that the clinical response of patients with these diseases may be genetically influenced, based on the same genetic markers we have identified for our proposed treatment of AF with Gencaro. 

We also have exclusive pharmacogenetic and other patent rights to drug candidates that have potential indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology and other therapeutic areas, in both early and later stages of development. We may seek partners to assist us in the development of these candidates or who may license them. We may also seek funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own. One of these candidates, recombinant Nematode Anticoagulation Protein c2, or rNAPc2, is a potential therapy for the disease syndrome caused by infection from hemorrhagic fever viruses and other pathogens. In February 2015, the World Health Organization prioritized rNAPc2 for testing in human efficacy trials in patients infected with the Ebola virus. The U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products Development has granted orphan drug designation to rNAPc2 as a potential treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever post-exposure to the Ebola virus. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development to novel drugs or biologics that treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The designation 

provides the drug developer with a seven-y ear period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon marketing approval, as well as certain financial incentives that can help support development of the drug. 

Competition 

Current AF treatments include pharmaceutical intervention and device intervention. There are several antiarrhythmic drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment and/or prevention of recurrent AF. However, these drugs have safety and/or administration concerns and all but one have contraindications or label warnings regarding their prescription in patients with heart failure. 

Considering that most of the approved drugs and device interventions for the treatment or prevention of AF have notable risks or adverse side effects, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new AF treatments that have fewer side effects than currently available therapies and are more effective, particularly in patients with HF where the approved drugs are contra-indicated or have warnings regarding their prescribing information. We believe that Gencaro&#8217;s prevention of AF in HF patients would provide this patient population a safer treatment option than other treatments currently approved by the FDA. 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to treat cardiovascular conditions. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing, and commercial resources than we have. 

In addition, our proposed prescribing information for Gencaro includes a recommendation for genetic testing, which will add additional cost and procedures to the process of prescribing Gencaro, and which could make it more difficult for us to compete against existing or future therapies. 

Manufacturing and Product Supply 

Gencaro is a small molecule drug with an established manufacturing history. Multiple manufacturers of both the API and drug product have successfully produced Gencaro for use in clinical trials over the course of its clinical development. We outsource all manufacturing and analytical testing of the Gencaro API and drug product. We have selected third party contract manufacturing organizations on the basis of their technical and regulatory expertise. Our approach with our contract manufacturing partners has been to replicate the manufacturing processes that were used to support the prior pivotal clinical trial with Gencaro, and to minimize any changes from these baseline processes, thereby reducing technical and regulatory risk. We contracted with Groupe Novasep to complete the drug substance registration batches required for the Gencaro NDA. These batches were successful, and the resulting drug substance was used to supply the drug product registration campaign. Remaining inventory was placed in current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, storage to provide a backup supply for the GENETIC-AF trial, and for use as an initial source of drug substance to support eventual product launch, if approved. 

For drug product production, we have contracted with Patheon, Inc. to manufacture the Gencaro tablets. Gencaro is produced in a tablet form, utilizing standard solid oral dosage processing techniques. Six separate dosage strengths are manufactured, with the maximum recommended dose of 50mg twice daily for patients weighing 75kg or less and 100mg twice daily for patients weighing more than 75kg. Registration batches were successfully completed by Patheon, Inc. and tablets from these runs have been placed in cGMP storage to supply the GENETIC-AF trial. In addition, we have contracted with a separate service provider for packaging and distribution of our clinical trial materials. 

Our manufacturing focus for 2016 is to supply the blinded clinical trial materials for Gencaro and the comparator compound, and to manage the clinical distribution channels necessary for the successful execution of the GENETIC-AF trial. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses totaled $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $5.6 million for 2014, an increase of approximately $1.4 million. R&#38;D expense in 2016 is expected to be higher than 2015 as we continue to enroll patients in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. 

Government Regulation 

Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, marketing, distribution, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. In the United States, the FDA regulates these activities at the federal level pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In Canada, Health Canada regulates these activities. We anticipate that all of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining approval and the subsequent process of maintaining compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and 

financial resources . In addition, these statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and our products may be subject to new legislation or regulations. Both before and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other state a nd federal statutes can lead to significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse to provide certificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in c ompliance. 

Premarket Approval of Drugs 

FDA approval is required for marketing of any new drug, dosage form, indication, or strength. The steps required before new human therapeutic drug products are marketed in the United States and foreign countries include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. There is no guarantee that products will be approved in a specific timeframe or at all. 

Preclinical Phase . Preclinical studies are generally conducted in the laboratory to identify potential drug candidates and to evaluate their potential efficacy and safety. These studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate short and long-term toxicity in animals. Preclinical studies are governed by numerous regulations, including but not limited to FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices. 

Clinical Phase . Before human clinical trials can commence, an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, submitted to FDA must become effective. For an IND to become effective, the applicant must submit, among other things, information on design of the proposed investigation, reports necessary to assess the safety of the drug for use in clinical investigation, and information on the chemistry and manufacturing of the drug, controls available for the drug, and primary data tabulations from animal or human studies. The clinical phase of development involves the performance of human studies, including adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication. Typically, clinical evaluation involves three sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a relatively small number of subjects or patients to determine the early safety profile of a product candidate, as well as dose tolerance, absorption, and the pattern of drug distribution and drug metabolism. Phase 2 trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted by a specific target disease to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosage tolerance and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3, larger-scale, multi- center trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific target disease over a longer term to confirm Phase 2 results and provide reliable and conclusive data supporting efficacy and safety of a drug as required by regulatory agencies for drug approval. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation. FDA may delay or suspend clinical trials through clinical holds. 

NDA Submission. In the United States, the results of preclinical and clinical testing along with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA. Under the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, after submission of an NDA and payment, or waiver, of the required fee, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review most standard NDAs within 10 months from the time that a sponsor&#8217;s application is accepted as filed by the FDA, which can occur within a 60-day window following the initial submission of the application. At the end of the 10 months, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to issue a &#8220;complete response,&#8221; or approve the NDA. While FDA&#8217;s goal is to issue a complete response within 10 months, the process may take longer than 10 months, particularly if multiple review cycles are required. 

In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or deny the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy the statutory and regulatory approval criteria. A denial may include a request for additional information, including additional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Under the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA is authorized to approve a drug based on a single adequate and well-controlled study if such study and other confirmatory data are sufficient to establish the drug&#8217;s effectiveness. However, it has long been the FDA&#8217;s general position that the standard of proof of a drug&#8217;s effectiveness generally requires at least two well-controlled and adequate Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrating statistically significant results as compared to a placebo or active control (with p-values of less than 0.05) with respect to the primary endpoint or endpoints of the trial. 

In addition, in accordance with current FDA law and regulations, the FDA may refer a drug to an advisory committee for review prior to approval. Most new compounds are referred to an FDA advisory committee, which could add additional time to the review process. There is no guarantee that the advisory committee will recommend approval of a drug candidate. In some cases, FDA may require completion, within a specified time period, of additional clinical studies after approval, referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, to monitor the effect of a new product and may prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Furthermore, prior to granting approval, the FDA generally conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing and control of the drug substance and finished drug product for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. 

I f the FDA approves the NDA, the sponsor is authorized to begin commercialization of the drug in accordance with the approval. Even if the FDA approves the NDA, the FDA may decide later to suspend or withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory s tandards is not maintained or if safety problems are recognized after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require ad ditional clinical studies, to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA also has authority to request implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, that could restrict distribution of Gencaro or require us to provide additional risk information to prescribers. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by comparable foreign regulatory authorities is necess ary prior to the commencement of marketing of a product candidate in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required for FDA approval. 

Post-approval Compliance. If regulatory approval for a drug or medical device is obtained, the product and the facilities manufacturing the product are subject to periodic inspection and continued regulation by regulatory authorities, including compliance with cGMP, as well as labeling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for labeling, promotion to health care professionals, direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Companies are responsible for compliance with such requirements and would be responsible to ensure that all contract manufacturing organizations who perform work for them also comply with such requirements. Similarly, if a drug manufacturer hires contract sales representatives or consultants to promote its products, such organizations or individuals must comply with all of the same requirements applicable to the drug manufacturer. The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with cGMPs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA&#8217;s regulations can result in a variety of administrative or enforcement actions, including but not limited to an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusions of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), a public warning letter, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. 

Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for patent term restoration and the award, in certain circumstances, of non-patent marketing exclusivities. 

Generic Drug Approval . The Hatch-Waxman Act established an abbreviated FDA review process for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to approved pioneer drugs. Approval for a generic drug is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Generic drug applications are &#8220;abbreviated&#8221; because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, an ANDA applicant must establish that its product is bioequivalent to an approved drug and that it is the same as the approved drug with respect to active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, strength and recommended conditions of use (labeling). The FDA will approve the generic as suitable for an ANDA if it finds that the generic does not raise questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the pioneer drug. A drug is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the pioneer drug or if it is intended for a different use. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of an approved drug listed in FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug has been listed in the Orange Book; (ii) that each patent listed in the Orange Book for that approved drug has expired; (iii) FDA should approve the product on the date on which a listed patent expires; or (iv) that such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic drug. If the ANDA applicant makes a certification pursuant to (iv) above, or a Paragraph IV certification, and the NDA holder files an infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notification, the NDA owner is entitled to an automatic 30-month stay of FDA&#8217;s ability to approve the ANDA. This 30-month stay will end early upon any decision by a court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the generic drug. 

Patent Term Extension . While the term of a U.S. patent is generally 20 years from the earliest priority date of a patent application (excluding a provisional patent application), a U.S. patent that covers subject matter requiring regulatory approval to market is eligible for an extension of that patent term. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an application. Patent Term Extension, or PTE, extends the term of an issued patent for generally (i) the length of the FDA approval process, i.e., the complete period of NDA review, and (ii) half of the time spent in clinical trials, i.e., the investigational new drug (IND) period. However, the maximum period of restoration cannot exceed five years, or restore the total remaining term of the patent to greater than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. 

Under 35 U.S.C. &#167; 156(a), a patent covering a method of using a product is eligible for PTE if the following conditions are met: 

&#160;

1) 

the patent has not yet expired; 

&#160;

2) 

the patent was not previously extended; 

&#160;

3) 

the patent owner submits an application for PTE that includes all necessary supporting information within 60 days of FDA approval; 

&#160;

4) 

the product was subject to regulatory review before its commercial marketing or use; and 

&#160;

5) 

the drug application is for the first permitted commercial marketing of the product. 

We have obtained four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,678,824; 8,080,578; 8,093,286; 8,946,284). We believe that, if Gencaro is approved by the FDA, any one of the U.S. patents may be eligible for PTE, which could provide approximately 5 years of additional patent life based on our current clinical trial plans. 

A Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, is a form of patent term extension that is available for pharmaceutical products approved for marketing in the European Union. We obtained a patent in Europe on methods for using Gencaro that is similar to US Patent 7,678,824 (EP 1802775); this EP patent is in force in certain countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We believe that this patent may be eligible for an SPC, if Gencaro is approved for marketing in any European country in which the patent is in force, which could provide up to five years of additional patent life. 

Non-Patent Marketing Exclusivities. Separate and apart from patent protection, the Hatch-Waxman Act entitles approved drugs to various periods of non-patent statutory protection, known as marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of &#8220;new chemical entity&#8221; marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active moiety not found in any other approved product. This exclusivity means that another manufacturer cannot submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the marketing exclusivity period ends. This exclusivity protects the entire new chemical entity franchise, including all products containing the active ingredient for any use and in any strength or dosage form, but will not prevent the submission or approval of stand-alone NDAs where the applicants have conducted their own clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. There is an exception, however, for a competitor that seeks to challenge a patent with a Paragraph IV certification. Four years into the five-year exclusivity period, a manufacturer who alleges that one or more of the patents listed with the NDA is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed may submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic or modified version of the product. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of &#8220;new use&#8221; marketing exclusivity for the approval of NDAs, and supplements, where those applications contain the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA&#8217;s approval of the applications. Such applications may be submitted for new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or new conditions of use of approved products. So long as the studies are essential to the FDA&#8217;s approval or were conducted by or for the applicant, this three-year exclusivity prohibits the final approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for products with the specific changes associated with those studies. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other products containing the same active ingredient, without those changes. 

FDA Premarket Review of Medical Devices 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that a company wishes to market in the United States requires either approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, or clearance of a premarket notification, commonly known as a &#8220;510(k)&#8221; from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which may require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. Clearance of a 510(k) usually requires between three months and one year from the time of submission of the 510(k), although the process may take longer. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance procedure is less rigorous than the PMA approval procedure, but is available only to companies who can establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed &#8220;predicate&#8221; device that was (i) on the market prior to the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, (ii) reclassified from Class III to Class II, or (iii) has been cleared through the 510(k) procedure. 510(k)s must typically be supported by performance data, including preclinical data, bench testing, and in some cases, clinical data. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, or for which there is no predicate, are placed in class III, and require a PMA. 

PMA Pathway . Generally, a PMA must be supported by extensive data and valid scientific evidence, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information and will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations, or QSR. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the &#8220;accepted application&#8221;, although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, and it may take significantly longer. The PMA application process can be expensive, and there is a substantial &#8220;user fee&#8221; that must be paid to FDA in connection with the submission of a PMA application. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a &#8220;not approvable&#8221; letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. In addition, if FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information, FDA may refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. After the PMA is 

approved, if significant changes are made to a device, its manufacturing or labeling, a PMA supplement containing additional information must be filed for prior FDA approval. PMA supplements often must be approved by the FDA before the modification t o the device, the labeling, or the manufacturing process may be implemented. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the proposed study is deemed a non-significant risk study, which is eligible for an exemption from the IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA&#8217;s regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the United States. 

In Vitro Diagnostic Companion Diagnostic Devices. FDA has described IVD companion diagnostic devices as in vitro diagnostic devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a particular therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, as well as in the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic product. An IVD companion diagnostic device could be used to (i) identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; (ii) identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or (iii) monitor response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Although FDA&#8217;s regulation of IVD companion diagnostic devices is evolving and implemented on a case-by-case basis, FDA&#8217;s stated policy for a novel therapeutic product is that an IVD companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously to support the therapeutic product&#8217;s safe and effective use. The clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device is to be established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. FDA recognizes, however, that there may be cases where contemporaneous development may not be possible. With respect to the Gencaro Test, there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and obtain approval or clearance contemporaneously with Gencaro. Failure to develop the Gencaro Test or obtain clearance or approval could delay approval of Gencaro, if FDA regards the Gencaro Test as an IVD companion diagnostic test that is essential to the safe and effective use of Gencaro. 

Continuing Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer, or holder of a PMA approval. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices distributed in the United States must be manufactured in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, and current good manufacturing practices. These regulations govern the manufacturing process, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and purchasing, as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort. Companies are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including but not limited to product listing and establishment registration, post-market surveillance requirements, limitations on promotion, and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse events, malfunctions, corrections and removals. As discussed above, FDA regularly inspects companies to assess compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, and potential civil and criminal penalties. With respect to the Gencaro Test, we intend to seek a new or amended collaborative arrangement with a diagnostic company in which we could license them certain rights to perform the diagnostic test for patients with AF. As part of such arrangement, we will seek to have the diagnostic company take responsibility for compliance with the FDA&#8217;s device approval and on-going regulatory requirements. 

International Marketing Approvals. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and are subject to change. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. 

Other Regulatory Requirements. We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our work. The extent and character of governmental regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. 

Medical Device Tax 

In March 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation. Among other initiatives, these laws impose significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. medical device sales, with certain exemptions, beginning on January 1, 2013. The Gencaro Test is likely to be subject to this tax.

Intellectual Property 

The future success of our business will partly depend on our ability to maintain market exclusivity for Gencaro in the United States and important international markets, and for other products or product candidates that we may acquire or develop. We will rely on statutory protection, patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, and in-licensing of technology rights to maintain protection for our products. 

We believe that both patent protection and data exclusivity statutes will give Gencaro market exclusivity in the United States and in major international markets. If approved by the FDA or international regulatory agencies, Gencaro will qualify as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, as it has never received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction. As an NCE, Gencaro will enjoy market exclusivity in the United States and most international markets under data exclusivity statutes. These laws provide for an exclusivity period beginning from regulatory approval, during which any generic competitor is barred from submitting an application that relies on the data that has been submitted in connection with the approval of the NCE. In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an initial period of up to five years from approval of the NCE, during which a generic application attempting to rely on the data submitted for the NCE cannot be filed with the FDA. This period can be effectively extended to seven and one-half years from FDA approval because a provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an automatic 30-month extension of the exclusivity period if we promptly pursue litigation against a company attempting to enter the market with a generic for a drug that is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent. 

Many international markets have data exclusivity statutes that are analogous to Hatch-Waxman and often more protective. The analogous statute in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency will, in general, provide Gencaro with a minimum of ten years of protection before such a generic application may be approved. Protection under Hatch-Waxman and other data exclusivity statutes is sometimes considered superior to patent protection, as the generic cannot be marketed during the period of exclusivity, thus eliminating the need to initiate patent infringement litigation with its accompanying risks and costs. 

In addition to protection under data exclusivity statutes, we believe that Gencaro&#8217;s patent portfolio will also provide market exclusivity. We have been granted patents in the United States and Europe that claim the use of Gencaro in patients predicted to have a favorable response to the drug based on genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding the beta-1 and/or alpha-2C receptors. We believe that this patent strategy may deter generic competition because of the threat of patent litigation or may exclude generic competition from the market until the patents expire if we are successful in litigation. Consequently, if our patent strategy is successful, we believe we may avoid generic competition with Gencaro in the United States or certain countries in Europe until at least the expiration of these patents, which would be no earlier than 2026 in the United States and into 2025 in Europe. In addition, we believe that if Gencaro is approved, any one of our U.S. patents may be entitled to an extension of its term and the European patent may be entitled to an extension through a supplemental protection certificate in one or more countries in Europe. The length of any such extension may vary by country. We cannot predict whether any such extensions will be granted, but if they are, they may provide market exclusivity for Gencaro into approximately 2030 in the United States and Europe. In addition, we were granted a patent on the S-isomer formulation of Gencaro, which we believe could be important in Gencaro&#8217;s future development. 

We also have patent rights relating to rNAPc2, as well as other patent rights in additional pharmacogenetic drug candidates having possible indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, and other therapeutic areas; these are in both early and later stages of development. We may seek collaborators to assist us in the development of these candidates or we may seek to raise funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 18 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees. 

Corporate Information 

On January 27, 2009, the Company completed a business combination, or the Merger, between Nuvelo, Inc., or Nuvelo, a corporation originally incorporated in 1992, and its subsidiary, ARCA biopharma, Inc. Immediately following the Merger, the Company changed its name from Nuvelo, Inc. to ARCA biopharma, Inc. Our principal offices are located in Westminster, Colorado. 

On September 3, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to implement a seven-for-one reverse split of our comm on stock. On September 4, 2015, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on a post-split basis. 

The reverse split effected a proportionate adjustment to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or settlement of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our existing stock option plans were reduced proportionately. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse split, and stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to a fractional share received in lieu thereof, a cash payment based on the closing sale price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market on September 3, 2015. The reverse split did not alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock.
