(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 

Issuance of 2025 Senior Notes and Retirement of 2015 Senior Notes 

On February 24, 2015, Kemper issued $250.0 million &#32;of its 4.35% &#32;senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the &#8220;2025 Senior Notes&#8221;). The net proceeds of the issuance were $247.3 million , net of discount and transaction costs, for an effective yield of 4.49% . The 2025 Senior Notes are unsecured and may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time at Kemper&#8217;s option at specified redemption prices. Kemper used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Senior Notes, together with available cash, to redeem in full the $250.0 million &#32;outstanding principal amount of its 6.00% Senior Notes due November 30, 2015. 

Purchase of Alliance United Group 

On April 30, 2015 , Kemper acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Alliance United Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Alliance United Insurance Company and Alliance United Insurance Services, (individually and collectively referred to herein as &#8220;Alliance United&#8221;) in a cash transaction for a total purchase price of $71.0 million , of which $17.5 million &#32;is being held in escrow to secure the sellers&#8217; potential indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement. After completing the transaction, Kemper contributed $75.0 million &#32;to support the book of business acquired and commuted a quota share reinsurance agreement whereby Alliance United had ceded a portion of its business to an unaffiliated reinsurer. Alliance United is a provider of nonstandard personal automobile insurance in California. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its presence in the California nonstandard automobile insurance market by gaining access to additional brokers and gained expertise in serving the Hispanic market.

(c) DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Kemper is a diversified insurance holding company, with subsidiaries that provide automobile, homeowners, life, health, and other insurance products to individuals and businesses. The Company is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance and life and health insurance businesses. The Company conducts its operations through two operating segments: Property &#38; Casualty Insurance and Life &#38; Health Insurance. The Company conducts its operations solely in the United States. 

Kemper&#8217;s subsidiaries employ approximately 5,600 &#32;full-time associates supporting their operations, of which approximately 1,850 &#32;are employed in the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment, approximately 3,250 &#32;are employed in the Life &#38; Health Insurance segment and the remainder are employed in various corporate and other staff and shared functions. 

&#160;

Property and Casualty Insurance Business 

General 

The Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment provides automobile, homeowners, renters, fire, umbrella and other types of property and casualty insurance to individuals and commercial automobile insurance to businesses. Property insurance indemnifies an insured with an interest in physical property for loss of, or damage to, such property. Casualty insurance primarily covers liability for damage to property of, or injury to, a person or entity other than the insured. In most cases, casualty insurance also obligates the insurance company to provide a defense for the insured in litigation arising out of events covered by the policy. 

The Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment distributes its products primarily through independent agents and brokers who are paid commissions for their services. The Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment&#8217;s direct-to-consumer operations, which were placed into run-off in 2012, accounted for approximately 6% &#32;of the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment&#8217;s earned premiums in 2015 . In addition, the Life &#38; Health Insurance segment&#8217;s career agents also sell contents coverage for personal property to its customers. 

Earned premiums from automobile insurance accounted for 54% , 48% &#32;and 50% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated insurance premiums earned in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Revenues from automobile insurance accounted for 48% , 43% &#32;and 44% &#32;of Kemper&#8217;s consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Automobile insurance products include personal automobile insurance, ranging from preferred to nonstandard risks, and commercial automobile insurance. Nonstandard personal automobile insurance policyholders tend to have difficulty obtaining standard or preferred risk insurance, usually because of their driving records, claims experience or premium payment history. Homeowners insurance accounted for 14% , 17% &#32;and 16% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated insurance premiums earned in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Homeowners insurance accounted for 13% , 15% &#32;and 14% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

The Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, and conducts business in 47 &#32;states and the District of Columbia. The segment&#8217;s insurance products are offered by approximately 18,000 &#32;independent insurance agents and brokers. As shown in the following table, five &#32;states provided 71% &#32;of the segment&#8217;s premium revenues in 2015 . State

Property and Casualty Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 

The Company&#8217;s reserves for losses and LAE for property and casualty insurance (&#8220;Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves&#8221;) are reported using the Company&#8217;s estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and LAE for claims that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not yet been paid. 

Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves by business segment at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were: DOLLARS IN MILLIONS

In estimating the Company&#8217;s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves, the Company&#8217;s actuaries exercise professional judgment and must consider, and are influenced by, many variables that are difficult to quantify. Accordingly, the process of estimating and establishing the Company&#8217;s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of claims may vary materially from the estimated amounts reserved. The reserving process is particularly imprecise for claims involving asbestos, environmental matters, construction defect and other emerging and/or long-tailed exposures that may not be discovered or reported until years after the insurance policy period has ended. Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves related to the Company&#8217;s Discontinued Operations are predominantly long-tailed exposures, of which $20.3 million &#32;was related to asbestos, environmental matters and construction defect exposures at December 31, 2015 . See MD&#38;A, &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates,&#8221; under the caption &#8220;Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses&#8221; beginning on page 57 &#32;for a discussion of the Company&#8217;s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company&#8217;s actuaries in estimating the Company&#8217;s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves. 

The Company&#8217;s goal is to ensure that its total reserves for property and casualty insurance losses and LAE are adequate to cover all costs, while minimizing variation from the time reserves for losses and LAE are initially estimated until losses and LAE are fully developed. Changes in the Company&#8217;s estimates of these losses and LAE, also referred to as &#8220;development,&#8221; will occur over time and may be material. Favorable development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company decreases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in an increase in net income in the period recognized, whereas adverse development is recognized and reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the Company increases its previous estimate of ultimate losses and LAE and results in a decrease in net income. 

Development of property and casualty insurance losses and LAE from prior accident years for each of the Company&#8217;s continuing business segments and discontinued operations in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was: DOLLARS IN MILLIONS

&#32;5 

for insured events of prior years and the Company&#8217;s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves at the end of the year and additional information regarding the nature of adjustments to incurred losses and LAE for insured events of prior years. 

Catastrophe Losses 

Catastrophes and natural disasters are inherent risks of the property and casualty insurance business. These catastrophic events and natural disasters include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, high winds and winter storms. Such events result in insured losses that are, and are expected to be, a material factor in the results of operations and financial position of Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies. Further, because the level of insured losses that could occur in any one year cannot be accurately predicted, these losses contribute to material year-to-year fluctuations in the results of operations and financial position of these companies. Specific types of catastrophic events are more likely to occur at certain times within the year than others. This factor adds an element of seasonality to property and casualty insurance claims. The occurrence and severity of catastrophic events cannot be accurately predicted in any year. However, some geographic locations are more susceptible to these events than others. The Company has endeavored to manage its direct insurance exposures in certain regions that are prone to naturally occurring catastrophic events through a combination of geographic diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of new business production in such regions, modifications of, and/or limitations to coverages and deductibles for certain perils in such regions and reinsurance. The Company has adopted the industry-wide catastrophe classifications of storms and other events promulgated by Insurance Services Office, Inc. (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) to track and report losses related to catastrophes. ISO classifies a disaster as a catastrophe when the event causes $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. ISO-classified catastrophes are assigned a unique serial number recognized throughout the insurance industry. The discussions throughout this 2015 &#32;Annual Report utilize ISO&#8217;s definition of catastrophes. 

The process of estimating and establishing reserves for catastrophe losses is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate cost of a claim, net of reinsurance recoveries, may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. See Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220; Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition &#8221; for a discussion of catastrophe risk. See Note 20 , &#8220; Catastrophe Reinsurance ,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the factors that influence the process of estimating and establishing reserves for catastrophes. 

Reinsurance 

The Company manages its exposure to catastrophes and other natural disasters through a combination of geographical diversification, restrictions on the amount and location of risks insured in certain regions and reinsurance. To limit its exposures to catastrophic events, the Company maintains a primary catastrophe reinsurance program for the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment. Coverage for the primary catastrophe reinsurance program is provided in various layers and reinsurance contracts. The Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment and the Life &#38; Health Insurance segment also purchase reinsurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the &#8220;FHCF&#8221;) for hurricane losses in Florida at retentions lower than those described below for the Company&#8217;s primary catastrophe reinsurance program. 

Coverage for the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment&#8217;s primary catastrophe reinsurance program for 2016 is provided by two three-year reinsurance contracts. Each reinsurance contract provides coverage in two layers, which together provide coverage for losses on individual catastrophes of $300 million in excess of $50 million. The first reinsurance contract provides coverage over the three-year period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 (the &#8220;2015 Reinsurance Contract&#8221;). The percentage of coverage under the 2015 Reinsurance Contract in the first, second and third years is 95%, 63.3% and 31.7%, respectively. Under the 2015 Reinsurance Contract, the participation of each reinsurer decreases by one-third in the second year and another one-third in the third year. Accordingly, in order to maintain the same percentage of coverage for 2016 as provided in the initial year of the 2015 Reinsurance Contract, the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment entered into a second reinsurance contract covering the three-year period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 (the &#8220;2016 Reinsurance Contract&#8221;). Under the 2016 Reinsurance Contract, the percentage of coverage is 31.7% for each year in the three-year period, and participation of each reinsurer remains the same over the entire three-year period. Coverage provided under the combined 

programs for 2016 (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016) is provided in various layers as presented below. &#160;

To maintain the same percentage of coverage in subsequent years as provided by the combined programs in 2016, the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment will need to purchase additional reinsurance in the future. 

The estimated aggregate annual premium in 2016 for the combined programs presented in the preceding table is $12.6 million . Premiums due to the reinsurers will decrease proportionately with the decline in their respective participations in the second and third years of the 2015 Reinsurance Contract. In the event that the Company&#8217;s incurred catastrophe losses and LAE covered by its catastrophe reinsurance program exceed the retention for a particular layer, the combined programs require one reinstatement of such coverage. In such an instance, the Company is required to pay a reinstatement premium to the reinsurers to reinstate the full amount of reinsurance available under such layer. The reinstatement premium for the first layer of coverage is a percentage of the full original premium based on the ratio of the losses in excess of the Company&#8217;s retention to the reinsurers&#8217; coverage limit. The reinstatement premium for the second layer of coverage is a percentage of half the original premium based on the ratio of the losses in excess of the Company&#8217;s retention to the reinsurers&#8217; coverage limit. 

The coverage presented in the preceding table differs from the coverage provided in 2014 and 2013. See Note 20 , &#8220; Catastrophe Reinsurance ,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to the primary catastrophe reinsurance programs for the Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment for 2014 and 2013. 

In addition to the catastrophe loss exposures caused by natural events described above, Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies are exposed to losses from catastrophic events that are not the result of acts of nature, such as acts of terrorism, the nature, occurrence and severity of which in any period cannot be accurately predicted. The companies have reinsurance coverage to address certain exposures to potential future terrorist attacks. The reinsurance coverage for certified events, as designated by the federal government, is from the Terrorist Risk Insurance Act and the coverage for non-certified events is available in the catastrophe reinsurance program for Kemper&#8217;s Property &#38; Casualty Insurance segment. However, certain perils, such as biological, chemical, nuclear pollution or contamination, are excluded from the reinsurance coverage for non-certified events. 

In addition to the catastrophe reinsurance programs described above, Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies utilize other reinsurance arrangements to limit their maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposures on larger risks. 

Under the various reinsurance arrangements, Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies are indemnified by reinsurers for certain losses incurred under insurance policies issued by the reinsurers. As indemnity reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from its direct obligations to policyholders on risks insured, Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies remain directly liable. However, provided that the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies purchase their reinsurance only from reinsurers rated &#8220;A-&#8221; or better by A. M. Best Co., Inc. (&#8220;A.M. Best&#8221;), at the time of purchase. A.M. Best is an organization that specializes in rating insurance and reinsurance companies. 

For further discussion of the reinsurance programs, see Note 20 , &#8220; Catastrophe Reinsurance ,&#8221; and Note 21 , &#8220; Other Reinsurance ,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Pricing 

Pricing levels for property and casualty insurance products are influenced by many factors, including the frequency and severity of claims, state regulation and legislation, competition, general business and economic conditions, including market rates of interest, inflation, expense levels, and judicial decisions. In addition, many state regulators require consideration of investment income when approving or setting rates, which could reduce underwriting margins. See MD&#38;A under the caption &#8220;Property &#38; Casualty Insurance.&#8221; 

Competition 

Based on the most recent annual data published by A.M. Best, as of the end of 2014 , there were 1,242 &#32;property and casualty insurance groups in the United States. Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty group was among the top 8% &#32;of property and casualty insurance groups in the United States as measured by net written premiums, policyholders&#8217; surplus and admitted assets in 2014 . Among all personal lines automobile insurance writers, Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty group was the 26th &#32;largest writer as measured by net written premiums in 2014 .

In 2014 , the U.S. property and casualty insurance industry&#8217;s estimated net premiums written were $507 billion , of which nearly 80% &#32;were accounted for by the top 50 groups of property and casualty insurance companies. Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies wrote less than 1% &#32;of the industry&#8217;s 2014 &#32;premium volume. 

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, particularly with respect to personal automobile insurance. Kemper&#8217;s property and casualty insurance companies compete on the basis of, among other measures, (i) using suitable pricing segmentation, (ii) maintaining underwriting discipline, (iii) settling claims timely and efficiently, (iv) offering products in selected markets or geographies, (v) utilizing technological innovations for the marketing and sale of insurance, (vi) controlling expenses, (vii) maintaining adequate ratings from A.M. Best and other ratings agencies and (viii) providing quality services to independent agents and policyholders. See Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220; The insurance industry is highly competitive, making it difficult to grow profitability and within expectations of investors. &#8221; 

Life and Health Insurance Business 

The Company&#8217;s Life &#38; Health Insurance segment consists of Kemper&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries, United Insurance Company of America (&#8220;United Insurance&#8221;), The Reliable Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Reliable&#8221;), Union National Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Union National Life&#8221;), Mutual Savings Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Mutual Savings Life&#8221;), United Casualty Insurance Company of America (&#8220;United Casualty&#8221;), Union National Fire Insurance Company (&#8220;Union National Fire&#8221;), Mutual Savings Fire Insurance Company (&#8220;Mutual Savings Fire&#8221;) and Reserve National Insurance Company (&#8220;Reserve National&#8221;). As discussed below, United Insurance, Reliable, Union National Life, Mutual Savings Life, United Casualty, Union National Fire and Mutual Savings Fire (the &#8220;Kemper Home Service Companies&#8221;) distribute their products through a network of employee, or &#8220;career,&#8221; agents. Reserve National distributes its products through a network of independent agents and brokers. These career agents, independent agents and brokers are paid commissions for their services. 

Earned premiums from life insurance accounted for 19% , 21% &#32;and 19% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated insurance premiums earned in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Revenues from life insurance accounted for 25% , 27% &#32;and 24% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. As shown in the following table, five &#32;states provided 51% &#32;of the premium revenues in this segment in 2015 . State

Kemper Home Service Companies 

The Kemper Home Service Companies, based in St. Louis, Missouri, focus on providing individual life and supplemental accident and health insurance products to customers of modest incomes who desire basic protection for themselves and their families. Their leading product is ordinary life insurance, including permanent and term insurance. Face amounts of these policies are lower than those of policies typically sold to higher income customers by other companies in the life insurance industry. Approximately 78% &#32;of the Life &#38; Health Insurance segment&#8217;s premium revenues are generated by the Kemper Home Service Companies. 

The Kemper Home Service Companies employ nearly 2,200 &#32;career agents to distribute insurance products in 25 &#32;states and the District of Columbia. These career agents are full-time employees who call on customers in their homes to sell insurance products, provide services related to policies in force and collect premiums, typically monthly. Premiums average about $20 &#32;per 

&#160; 

&#32;8 

policy per month with an average face value of $5,300 . Permanent and term policies are offered primarily on a non-participating, guaranteed-cost basis. These career agents also distribute and/or service certain property insurance products for the Kemper Home Service Companies. 

Reserve National 

Reserve National, based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is licensed in 48 &#32;states throughout the United States and has traditionally specialized in the sale of Medicare Supplement insurance and limited health insurance coverages, such as fixed indemnity and accident-only plans, primarily to individuals in rural areas who often do not have access to a broad array of accident and health insurance products tailored to meet their individual and family needs. Reserve National&#8217;s traditional distribution channel consists of approximately 300 &#32;independent agents. 

Reserve National began expanding its distribution channels during 2013 by launching two marketing channel initiatives &#8212;Kemper Senior Solutions and Kemper Benefits. Kemper Senior Solutions markets life insurance and home health care products focusing on the individual, senior-age demographic of the market place. Kemper Benefits sells voluntary products in the employer market place. Brokers and non-exclusive independent agents are utilized to market and distribute products in these new distribution channels. Reserve National has appointed approximately 22,000 independent agents in connection with these initiatives. 

Reinsurance 

Consistent with insurance industry practice, the Company&#8217;s life and health insurance companies utilize reinsurance arrangements to limit their maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposures on larger risks in its life and health insurance businesses. As the face amounts of its issued policies are relatively small, the ceded risks and corresponding premiums are also relatively small, particularly when compared to other companies in the industry. The segment is also exposed to losses from catastrophes arising from insurance policies distributed by career agents of the Kemper Home Service Companies. Over the last several years, the Kemper Home Service Companies have been intentionally reducing their exposure to catastrophic events through the run-off of their dwelling insurance business. Accordingly, except for reinsurance provided by the FHCF for catastrophe losses in Florida, the Kemper Home Service Companies have not carried catastrophe reinsurance since 2012. 

Lapse Ratio 

The lapse ratio is a measure of a life insurer&#8217;s loss of in-force policies. For a given year, this ratio is commonly computed as the total face amount of individual life insurance policies lapsed, surrendered, expired and decreased during such year, less policies increased and revived during such year, divided by the total face amount of policies at the beginning of the year plus the face amount of policies issued and reinsurance assumed in the prior year. The Life &#38; Health Insurance segment&#8217;s lapse ratio for individual life insurance was 6% , 7% &#32;and 7% &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

The customer base served by the Kemper Home Service Companies and competing life insurance companies tends to have a higher incidence of lapse than other demographic segments of the population. Thus, to maintain or increase the level of its business, the Kemper Home Service Companies must write a high volume of new policies. 

Pricing 

Premiums for life and health insurance products are based on assumptions with respect to mortality, morbidity, investment yields, expenses, and lapses and are also affected by state laws and regulations, as well as competition. Pricing assumptions are based on the experience of Kemper&#8217;s life and health insurance subsidiaries, as well as the industry in general, depending on the factor being considered. The actual profit or loss produced by a product will vary from the anticipated profit if the actual experience differs from the assumptions used in pricing the product. 

Premiums for policies sold by the Kemper Home Service Companies are set at levels designed to cover the relatively high cost of &#8220;in-home&#8221; servicing of such policies. As a result, Kemper Home Service Companies&#8217; premiums have a higher load for expense than the life insurance industry average. 

Premiums for Medicare supplement and other accident and health policies must take into account the rising costs of medical care. The annual rate of medical cost inflation has historically been higher than the general rate of inflation, necessitating frequent rate increases, most of which are subject to approval by state regulators.

Kemper&#8217;s life and health insurance subsidiaries generally compete by using appropriate pricing, offering products to selected markets or geographies, controlling expenses, maintaining adequate ratings from A.M. Best and providing competitive services to agents and policyholders. 

Investments 

The quality, nature and amount of the various types of investments that can be made by insurance companies are regulated by state laws. Depending on the state, these laws permit investments in qualified assets, including, but not limited to, municipal, state and federal government obligations, corporate bonds, real estate, preferred and common stocks, investment partnerships, limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships. In addition, the quality, nature and amount of the various types of investments held by Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries affect the amount of asset risk calculated by regulators and rating agencies in determining required capital. See &#8220;Regulation&#8221; immediately following this subsection and Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220; The Company&#8217;s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses. &#8221; 

The Company employs a total return investment strategy, with an emphasis on yield, while maintaining liquidity to meet both its short- and medium-term insurance obligations.

Regulation 

Overview of State Regulation 

Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they conduct business. Such regulation pertains to a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, policy forms, premium rate plans, licensing of agents, licenses to transact business, market conduct, trade practices, claims practices, transactions with affiliates, payment of dividends, investments and solvency. Insurance regulatory authorities perform periodic examinations of an insurer&#8217;s financial condition, market conduct and other affairs. 

Approval of Policy Rates and Forms 

The majority of Kemper&#8217;s insurance operations are in states requiring prior approval by regulators before proposed policy or coverage forms and rates for property, casualty, or health insurance policies may be implemented and used. However, provided that the policy form has been previously approved, rates proposed for life insurance generally become effective immediately upon filing with a state, even though the same state may require prior rate approval for other types of insurance. 

Financial Reports and Standards 

Insurance companies are required to report their financial condition and results of operation in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;). State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial examinations of insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements and establish standards for the types and amounts of investments. In addition, state regulators require minimum capital and surplus levels and 

&#160; 

&#32;10 

incorporate risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) standards promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in an insurance company&#8217;s business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, a company&#8217;s RBC requirements are calculated and compared to its total adjusted capital to determine whether regulatory intervention is warranted. At December 31, 2015, the total adjusted capital of each of Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum levels required under applicable RBC rules. 

Guaranty Funds and Risk Pools 

Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are required to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business. Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain fees imposed on health insurers by the Health Care Acts, including the Health Insurance Providers Fee, but not the fees associated with the Reinsurance, Risk Adjustment and Risk Corridor programs, as Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries do not have any policies subject to those fees. Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary pools or assigned risk pools, principally involving windstorms and high risk drivers. In most states, the involuntary pool participation of Kemper&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries is set in proportion to their voluntary writings of related lines of business in such states. See Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220; Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition &#8221; for a discussion of the impact of required participation in windstorm pools and joint underwriting associations on the ability of the Company to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. 

Dividends and Other Transactions with Affiliates 

Kemper and its insurance subsidiaries are also subject to the insurance holding company laws of a number of states. Certain dividends and distributions by an insurance subsidiary are subject to prior approval by the insurance regulators of its state of domicile. See Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; under the caption &#8220; Kemper relies on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock. &#8221; Other significant transactions between an insurance subsidiary and its holding company or other affiliates may require approval by insurance regulators in the state of domicile of each participating insurance subsidiary. 

Holding Company Regulation, Including Enterprise Risk Management and Governance 

A number of pending and recently approved legislative and regulatory measures may significantly affect the insurance business. In particular, nearly half of all states have already adopted extensive modifications to their holding company laws based on amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the &#8220;Model Holding Company Act&#8221;) adopted by the NAIC in December 2010. With varying effective dates beginning in 2014, these modifications impose new reporting requirements and substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators with regulatory authority over an insurance company to assess enterprise risks within such company&#8217;s entire holding company system that may arise from operations of its insurance and non-insurance affiliates. They also impose new reporting requirements on the ultimate controlling persons of such insurance companies in respect of, among other things, affiliated transactions and divestiture of controlling interests in the insurance companies. 

In addition, a number of states have adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the &#8220;Risk Management and Solvency Model Act&#8221;) adopted by the NAIC in 2012. With varying effective dates beginning in 2015, the Risk Management and Solvency Model Act requires insurers to maintain an enterprise risk management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) framework, perform regular assessments of the adequacy of the ERM framework and the company&#8217;s solvency and file an annual ERM assessment summary report. Similarly, the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act (the &#8220;Model Governance Act&#8221;) and Model Regulation adopted by the NAIC in 2014, requires, when adopted by an insurer&#8217;s (or insurance group&#8217;s) lead state, an insurer (or insurance group) to submit an annual disclosure with information about board structure, policies, meeting frequency and oversight of critical risk areas and practices. The Company anticipates that most states will adopt legislation based on the Model Holding Company Act, the Risk Management and Solvency Model Act and the Model Governance Act. 

Additional regulation has also resulted from other measures in recent years including, among other things, tort reform, the Health Care Acts, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), consumer privacy and data security requirements, credit score regulation, producer compensation regulations, cybersecurity and financial services regulation initiatives. In late 2015, the NAIC adopted the Cybersecurity Bill of Rights , a set of directives aimed at protecting consumer data, for insurance companies to follow to the extent incorporated in NAIC model laws and regulations adopted by states. Also in late 2015, the NAIC adopted amendments to the information technology section of its handbook for examiners to 

&#160; 

&#32;11 

strengthen and enhance the existing cybersecurity guidance. The Company anticipates a continuing focus on new regulatory and legislative proposals at the state and federal levels that further regulate practices regarding privacy and security of personal information. 

Change in Control Requirements 

State insurance laws also impose requirements that must be met prior to a change of control of an insurance company or insurance holding company based on the insurer&#8217;s state of domicile and, in some cases, additional states in which it is deemed commercially domiciled due to the substantial amount of business it conducts therein. These requirements may include the advance filing of specific information with the state insurance regulators, a public hearing on the matter, and the review and approval of the change of control by such regulators. The Company has insurance subsidiaries domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled in Alabama, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin. In these states, except Alabama, &#8220;control&#8221; generally is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. Control is presumed to exist in Alabama with a 5% or more ownership interest in such securities. Any purchase of Kemper&#8217;s shares that would result in the purchaser owning Kemper&#8217;s voting securities in the foregoing percentages for the states indicated would be presumed to result in the acquisition of control of the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries in those states. Therefore, acquisitions subject to the 10% threshold generally would require the prior approval of insurance regulators in each state in which the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled, including those in Alabama, while acquisitions subject to the 5% threshold generally would require the prior approval of only Alabama regulators. Similarly, consistent with the Model Holding Company Act, several of the states in which the Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted legislation that requires either the divesting and/or acquiring company to notify regulators of, and in some cases to receive regulatory approval for, a change in control. 

Many state statutes also require pre-acquisition notification to state insurance regulators of a change of control of an insurance company licensed in the state if specific market concentration thresholds would be triggered by the acquisition. Such statutes authorize the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the insurance company if certain conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition. These regulatory requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions effecting control of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries, or the ownership of Kemper&#8217;s voting securities, including transactions that could be advantageous to Kemper&#8217;s shareholders. 

Federal Government Regulation 

Kemper&#8217;s health insurance subsidiaries are subject to additional regulation by the federal government. For example, the Health Care Acts, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, have established minimum loss ratios, rating restrictions, mandates for essential health benefit coverages, and restrictions or prohibitions on pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime policy limits for health insurance policies. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, profoundly increases federal regulation of the financial services industry, of which the insurance industry is a part. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act formed a Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) charged with monitoring the insurance industry and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. FIO&#8217;s report, delivered to Congress in 2013, concluded that a hybrid approach to regulation, involving a combination of state and federal government action, could improve the U.S. insurance system by attaining uniformity, efficiency and consistency, particularly with respect to solvency and market conduct regulation. A hybrid approach was also recommended to address the perceived need for uniform supervision of insurance companies with national and global activities. FIO established the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance (&#8220;FACI&#8221;) whose mission is to provide recommendations to FIO on issues it monitors for Congress. While the NAIC continues to promote the strengths of the U.S. state-based insurance regulatory system, both FIO/FACI and international standard setting authorities such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors are actively seeking a role in shaping the future of the U.S. insurance regulatory framework. It is not yet known whether or how these organizations&#8217; recommendations might result in changes to the current state-based system of insurance industry regulation or ultimately impact Kemper&#8217;s operations.
