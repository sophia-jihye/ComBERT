 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 1, 1997 under the name of Avani Manufacturing (China) Inc. The Company changed its name to Genesis Water Technology on August 17, 1999, and to Supreme Group International, Inc. on December 24, 2000. On June 7, 2001, it changed its name to Amanasu Technologies Corporation. It changed its name again on December 21, 2007 to Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation. The Company is a development stage company, and has not conducted any operations or generated any revenue since its inception. 

Current 

As of April 27th, 2009, Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation (herein after the "Company"), acquired Amanasu Water Corporation from its sister company Amanasu Environment Corporation and renamed it Amanasu Support Corporation. 

The Company will continue to manufacture and market 2 technologies, which the Company believes have great market potential. 

The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc . , a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts. 

The second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology, extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now seeking, manufacturing partners.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (continued) 

Overview and History 

The Company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business (see "Cautionary Statements" below). The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a high-powered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter. The technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with Amanasu Corporation, formerly Family Corporation. Amanasu Corporation, a Japanese company and the Company's largest shareholder, acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors. Amanasu Corporation subsequently transferred the right to the Company, and the Company succeeded to the exclusive, worldwide rights. Atsushi Maki, a director and officer of the Company, is the sole shareholder of Amanasu Corporation. At this time, the Company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies, constructing four proto-type motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter. 

The market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive, thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully. To meet the economical sale price requirement the Company planned to conduct their manufacturing in China to reduce costs, and hoped it would meet the Company's expectations; however, significant difficulty with protecting the Company's proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged. In addition to proprietary issues, there were major concerns in customer service follow-ups (i.e. product warranty, maintenance, etc.). The Company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in China, the result of safety related incidents, if not managed appropriately, would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the Company. To solve the two major issues, the Company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition. Evader Motorsports, Inc. ("Evader"), an electric motorcycle producer, entered into an International Distributor Agreement, whereby the Company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of Evader products. Evader, in turn, would manage customer-service concerns. The Company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in Japan, with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties. The Company also considered Evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters. The Company believed that with a combined effort using both companies' resources and technology, the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market. 

Further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and Evader's scooters. The research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required. First the retail price of the Evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the Japanese market. The research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from China to Japan directly. The quality of their product is unclear; however, the retail price of the new company's product effectively competes in the Japanese market. The refinements needed to make the Evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time, thus the Company decided to discontinue business relations with Evader, and abandon the electric scooter project; however, the Company still holds the related patents. &#160; 

&#160; 

In place of the electric scooter, other projects including a cooperative effort with Seems Inc., formerly introduced as Pixen Inc., and their breakthrough "Bio-scent technology" are in development. Seems Inc. is a pioneer in the newly developed bio-scent technology industry. Bio-scent technology involves the application of "scent data transmission", a digitized form of scents, in various industries such as biotechnology, medical care, environment, security, etc. in addition to common aroma therapy. Due to its revolutionary technologies, Seems has been able to become a multi-million dollar company in less than 6 years and is expected to become public. Its DAA (Defensive Aromatic Air) is its current flagship product. 

In addition to being an air purifying system, Seems' DAA effectively removes up to 91% of air pollutants such as ammonia, and by products of cigarette smoke. It also provides odor neutralization, and air-borne anti-bacterial effects. Seems has also developed a scent-particle sensor, which is programmable to detect certain scent particles. This sensor is 1,000 times more sensitive than even a dog&#8217;s sense of smell. This scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection. All diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses. Seems' sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data. 

&#160; 

With uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the FDA for various technologies by Seems Inc., the Company decided to begin a new project in the Food/Beverage industry, specifically Franchise management under the new leadership of Yukinori Yoshino, who was appointed President of the Company as of October 16th, 2007; however, due to personal reasons unrelated to the Company, Mr. Yoshino stepped down as President as of May 11, 2009, with the Chairman Mr. Atsushi Maki assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer. 

The Company&#8217;s goal for the next 2 years is to enter into the NASDAQ global market.
