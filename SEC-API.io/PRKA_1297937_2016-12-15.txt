 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Parks! America, Inc., through our wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates two regional theme parks and is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation (&#147;Wild Animal &#150; Georgia&#148;) and Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (&#147;Wild Animal &#150; Missouri&#148;). Wild Animal &#150; Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the &#147;Georgia Park&#148;). Wild Animal &#150; Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the &#147;Missouri Park&#148;). 

Our Parks are open year round but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. On a combined basis, net sales for the third and fourth quarter of our last two fiscal years represented approximately 67% to 72% of annual net sales.

Our goal is to build a family of theme parks primarily through acquisitions of small, local and regional, privately owned existing parks and to develop a series of compatible, themed attractions. When evaluating possible acquisitions, we rely on the following primary criteria:

&#183;

Properties that have an operating history;

&#183;

Properties where our management team believes the potential exists to increase profits and operating efficiencies; and

&#183;

Properties where there is additional, underutilized land upon which to expand operations.

We believe that acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations. By using a combination of equity, debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with our pursuit of growth.

We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties.

Shares of our common stock trade on the OTC Markets Group OTCPink marketplace (&#147;OTCPink&#148;) under the symbol, &#147;PRKA.&#148;

Corporate History 

The Company was originally incorporated on July 30, 1954 as Painted Desert Uranium &#38; Oil Co., Inc. in Washington State. On October 1, 2002, Painted Desert Uranium &#38; Oil Co., Inc. changed its name to Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. and its corporate domicile to the State of Nevada.

On December 19, 2003, Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. acquired the assets of Great Western Parks LLC pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement that set the stage for our current corporate structure and operating strategy. We changed the name of the Company to Great American Family Parks, Inc. The acquisition was accounted for as a &#147;reverse acquisition&#148; in which Great Western Parks was considered to be the acquirer of Royal Pacific Resources for reporting purposes. As of June 11, 2008, the Company changed its name from Great American Family Parks, Inc. to its current name, Parks! America, Inc. In addition, effective June 25, 2008, the Company's quotation symbol on the OTCPink was changed from GFAM to PRKA. 

Wild Animal Safari, Inc. &#150; Our Georgia Park 

On June 13, 2005, Wild Animal &#150; Georgia acquired our Georgia Park in Pine Mountain, Georgia. Our Georgia Park is situated within a 200-acre portion of a 500-acre plot, which is owned by Wild Animal &#150; Georgia, located 75 miles southwest of Atlanta. Our Georgia Park includes a drive-through animal viewing area that opened in 1991. It is home to over 600 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. The majority of the animals roam wild in a natural habitat. Visitors are able to observe, photograph and feed the animals along the more than three miles of paved roads that run throughout the drive-through section of our Georgia Parks&#146; natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in areas within the natural habitat and others are located in a more traditional zoo-like atmosphere. Also within our Georgia Park is our reptile house, located next to our petting zoo, featuring reptiles from several continents. 

In addition to the animal environments, our Georgia Park contains a gift shop, a restaurant and ice cream parlor, an arcade, a picnic and group recreation area, lakes and a pavilion. We sell food and beverages in our restaurant, and gift items from the gift shop, including shirts and hats, specialty items, educational books and toys about animals of the world, other toys, authentic gifts from various continents (e.g. ostrich eggs, hides and skins) and other family oriented items. 

Wild Animal &#150; Georgia&#146;s revenues are primarily derived from admission fees, food and beverage sales, gift shop and specialty item sales, sales of animal food and vehicle rentals at our Georgia Park. Management&#146;s plans to grow revenues at our Georgia Park include ongoing improvements to existing facilities, making the Park more attractive to visitors and development of unused acreage surrounding the Park. 

A majority of Wild Animal &#150; Georgia&#146;s animals are born in our Georgia Park and the animals we acquire are generally purchased domestically. We rarely import animals. Auctions and sales of animals across the United States occur often and we may acquire animals in these auctions if we see an opportunity to enhance our Parks. Due to natural breeding, the animal population in our Georgia Park has grown in recent years. From time to time, we sell animals born in the Park, and these proceeds are recorded as revenue. The Company had no accounts receivable from animal sales as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively.

Food and beverages are purchased locally, although the main products and ingredients for the Noble Roman&#146;s Pizza and Tuscano&#146;s Subs are purchased from the national franchising company. Effective June 21, 2015, we renewed our rights to own and operate Noble Roman&#146;s Pizza and Tuscano&#146;s Italian Subs food franchises at our Georgia Park through June 20, 2020. The Company pays the franchisor a royalty of 7.0% on applicable gross product sales. 

Wild Animal, Inc. &#150; Our Missouri Park 

Wild Animal &#150; Missouri purchased our Missouri Park as of March 5, 2008. Our Missouri Park is situated in Strafford, Missouri on 255 acres of land located 12 miles east of Springfield and 45 miles north of Branson. Our Missouri Park is a drive-through wild animal park with five-mile course permitting access to approximately 600 animals, birds and reptiles, comprised of over 65 species. Most of the animals roam wild throughout the natural habitat. Visitors are able to observe, photograph and feed the animals along the paved roads that run throughout the drive-through section of our Missouri Parks&#146; natural habitat area. Some animals are contained in special fenced-in areas within natural habitats and other animals are located in a more traditional zoo-like atmosphere. In addition, our Missouri Park offers a gift shop, a food and beverage area and a petting zoo. During our 2013 fiscal year, we opened a reptile house within the more traditional zoo-like area of our Missouri Park, featuring reptiles from several continents. During our 2015 fiscal year, we completed the installation of five amusement park &#147;kiddie&#148; rides at our Missouri Park. These rides are targeted toward families with children between the ages of three and twelve years old.

Employees 

Our Georgia Park has approximately 14 full-time employees. During our Georgia Park&#146;s prime attendance season, which typically begins in the latter half of March and extends through early September, we generally engage up to 14 additional seasonal employees. Our Missouri Park has six year-round employees and has engaged up to 10 additional seasonal employees during the peak season. We also engage consultants from time to time. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and believe our relations with our employees are good. Parks! America has three officers who oversee the strategy of the Company, the operations of our Parks, as well as the overall financial activities, controls and reporting for the Company and each individual Park.
