Eight Minnesota Power taconite and iron concentrate customers produce approximately 77 percent of the iron ore produced in the &#32; U.S. according to the U.S. Geological Survey&#8217;s 2012 Minerals Yearbook published in September 2014. Sales to taconite customers and iron concentrate customers represented 4,000 &#32;million kilowatt-hours, or 60 percent , of total industrial customer kilowatt-hour sales in 2015 . Taconite, an iron-bearing rock of relatively low iron content, is abundantly available in northern Minnesota and an important domestic source of raw material for the steel industry. Taconite processing plants use large quantities of electric power to grind the iron-bearing rock, and agglomerate and pelletize the iron particles into taconite pellets. Iron concentrate reclamation facilities also use large quantities of electricity to extract and process iron-bearing tailings left from previous mining operations to produce iron ore concentrate. 

Minnesota Power provides electric service to five taconite customers capable of producing up to approximately 41 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Four of these customers are Large Power Customers (see Large Power Customer Contracts ). The fifth is Northshore Mining, owned and operated by Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., which self-generates a majority of its power, and is capable of producing approximately 6 million tons of taconite pellets annually. Taconite pellets produced in Minnesota are primarily shipped to North American steel making facilities that are part of the integrated steel industry. Steel produced from these North American facilities is used primarily in the manufacture of automobiles, appliances, pipe and tube products for the gas and oil industry, and in the construction industry. Historically, less than five percent of Minnesota taconite production is exported outside of North America. Minnesota Power also provides electric service to three iron concentrate facilities capable of producing up to approximately 4 million tons of iron concentrate per year. Iron concentrate is used in the production of taconite pellets. 

There has been a general historical correlation between U.S. steel production and Minnesota taconite production. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an association of North American steel producers, reported that U.S. raw steel production operated at approximately 71 percent &#32;of capacity in 2015 &#32;( 77 percent &#32;in 2014 &#32;and in 2013 ). Many steel producers reduced production in 2015, citing higher levels of imports and lower prices. Some Minnesota taconite and iron concentrate producers reduced production in 2015 in response to declining U.S. steel production.

* Preliminary data from the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 

Minnesota Power&#8217;s taconite customers may experience annual variations in production levels due to such factors as economic conditions, short-term demand changes or maintenance outages. We estimate that a one million ton change in Minnesota Power&#8217;s taconite customers&#8217; production would impact our annual earnings per share by approximately $0.03, net of expected power marketing sales at current prices. Changes in wholesale electric prices or customer contractual demand nominations could impact this estimate. Long-term reductions in taconite production or a permanent shut down of a taconite customer may lead Minnesota Power to file a rate case to recover lost revenue. 

In addition to serving the taconite industry, Minnesota Power serves a number of customers in the paper, pulp and secondary wood products industry, which represented 1,456 &#32;million kilowatt-hours, or 22 percent , of total industrial customer kilowatt-hour sales in 2015 . The four major paper and pulp mills we serve reported operating at, or near, full capacity in 2015. In September 2014, Boise, Inc. (Boise) provided the required one-year written notice of its intent to install additional generation at its International Falls, Minnesota, paper mill which was completed in 2015. Boise&#8217;s reduction in demand is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Large Power Customer Contracts. &#32;Minnesota Power has 9 Large Power Customer contracts, each serving requirements of 10 MW or more of customer load. The customers consist of five taconite producing facilities (two of which are owned by one company and are served under a single contract), two concentrate reclamation facilities (both of which are owned by one company and are served under a single contract), and four paper and pulp mills. 

Large Power Customer contracts require Minnesota Power to have a certain amount of generating capacity available. In turn, each Large Power Customer is required to pay a minimum monthly demand charge that covers the fixed costs associated with having this capacity available to serve the customer, including a return on common equity. Most contracts allow customers to establish the level of megawatts subject to a demand charge on a four-month basis and require that a portion of their megawatt needs be committed on a take-or-pay basis for at least a portion of the term of the agreement. In addition to the demand charge, each Large Power Customer is billed an energy charge for each kilowatt-hour used that recovers the variable costs incurred in generating electricity. Three of the Large Power Customers have interruptible service which provides a discounted demand rate in exchange for the ability to interrupt the customers during system emergencies. Minnesota Power also provides incremental production service for customer demand levels above the contractual take-or-pay levels. There is no demand charge for this service and energy is priced at an increment above Minnesota Power&#8217;s cost. Incremental production service is interruptible.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Large Power Customer Contracts (Continued) 

All contracts with Large Power Customers continue past the contract termination date unless the required advance notice of cancellation has been given. The required advance notice of cancellation varies from one to four years. Such contracts minimize the impact on earnings that otherwise would result from significant reductions in kilowatt-hour sales to such customers. Large Power Customers are required to take all of their purchased electric service requirements from Minnesota Power for the duration of their contracts. The rates and corresponding revenue associated with capacity and energy provided under these contracts are subject to change through the same regulatory process governing all retail electric rates. (See Item 1. Business &#8211; Regulated Operations &#8211; Regulatory Matters &#8211; Electric Rates.) 

Minnesota Power, as permitted by the MPUC, requires its taconite-producing Large Power Customers to pay weekly for electric usage based on monthly energy usage estimates. These customers receive estimated bills based on Minnesota Power&#8217;s estimate of the customer&#8217;s energy usage, forecasted energy prices, and fuel clause adjustment estimates. Minnesota Power&#8217;s four taconite-producing Large Power Customers have generally predictable energy usage on a week-to-week basis, and any differences that occur are trued-up the following month.

On January 7, 2015, Verso Corporation acquired NewPage Corporation. This acquisition does not impact Minnesota Power&#8217;s electric service agreement with NewPage Corporation. On January 26, 2016, Verso Corporation announced that it had filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. (See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Outlook &#8211; Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load.) 

(e) 

On July 24, 2015, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval of a new electric service agreement (Agreement) for service to both Magnetation&#8217;s Plant 2 and Plant 4 facilities, with a term through at least December 31, 2025. This Agreement was approved by the MPUC in an order dated February 2, 2016, and is subject to bankruptcy court approval. (See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Outlook &#8211; Industrial Customers and Prospective Additional Load.) 

Residential and Commercial Customers. &#32;In 2015 , residential and commercial customers represented 18 percent &#32;of total regulated utility kilowatt-hour sales. Minnesota Power provides regulated utility electric service in northeastern Minnesota to approximately 144,000 &#32;residential and commercial customers. SWL&#38;P provides regulated electric, natural gas and water service in northwestern Wisconsin to approximately 15,000 &#32;electric customers, 13,000 &#32;natural gas customers and 10,000 &#32;water customers.

REGULATED OPERATIONS (Continued) 

Municipal Customers. &#32;In 2015 , municipal customers represented 6 percent &#32;of total regulated utility kilowatt-hour sales. Minnesota Power has 16 &#32;non-affiliated municipal customers in Minnesota. 

On April 21, 2015, Minnesota Power amended its formula-based wholesale electric sales contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission, extending the term through June 30, 2028. The electric service agreement with one other municipal customer is effective through June 30, 2019. The rates included in these contracts are set each July 1 based on a cost-based formula methodology, using estimated costs and a rate of return that is equal to Minnesota Power&#8217;s authorized rate of return for Minnesota retail customers (currently 10.38 percent ). The formula-based rate methodology also provides for a yearly true-up calculation for actual costs incurred. 

In September 2015, Minnesota Power amended its wholesale electric contracts with 14 &#32;municipal customers, extending the contract terms through December 31, 2024. These contracts include fixed capacity charges through 2018; beginning in 2019, the capacity charge will not increase by more than two percent &#32;or decrease by more than negative one percent &#32;from the previous year&#8217;s capacity charge and will be determined using a cost-based formula methodology. The base energy charge for each year of the contract term will be set each January 1, subject to monthly adjustment, and is also determined using a cost-based formula methodology. 

All of the wholesale contracts include a termination clause requiring a three -year notice to terminate. In January 2016, one of Minnesota Power&#8217;s municipal customers provided notice of its intent to terminate its contract effective June 30, 2019. Minnesota Power currently provides approximately 29 MW of average monthly demand to this customer. Under the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission agreement, no termination notice may be given prior to June 30, 2025. The remaining 14 &#32;municipal customers may not give termination notices prior to December 31, 2021. 

Other Power Suppliers. &#32;The Company also enters into off-system sales with Other Power Suppliers. These sales are sold at market-based prices into the MISO market on a daily basis or through bilateral agreements of various durations. 

Basin Power Sales Agreements. &#32;Minnesota Power has an agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity and energy to Basin for a ten-year period which expires in April 2020. The capacity charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule with a minimum annual escalation provision. The energy charge is based on a fixed monthly schedule and provides for annual escalation based on the cost of fuel. The agreement allows Minnesota Power to recover a pro rata share of increased costs related to emissions that occur during the last five years of the contract. On July 9, 2015, Minnesota Power entered into an additional agreement to sell 100 MW of capacity only to Basin at fixed rates for a two-year period beginning in June 2016. 

Minnkota Power Sales Agreement. &#32;Minnesota Power has a power sales agreement with Minnkota Power, which commenced June 1, 2014. Under the power sales agreement, Minnesota Power is selling a portion of its entitlement from Square Butte to Minnkota Power, resulting in Minnkota Power&#8217;s net entitlement increasing and Minnesota Power&#8217;s net entitlement decreasing until Minnesota Power&#8217;s share is eliminated at the end of 2025 . Of Minnesota Power&#8217;s 50 percent &#32;output entitlement, it sold to Minnkota Power approximately 28 percent &#32;in 2015 ( 23 percent &#32;in 2014). (See Note 12. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

Seasonality 

The operations of our industrial customers, which make up a large portion of our sales portfolio, are not typically subject to significant seasonal variations. (See Electric Sales / Customers. ) As a result, Minnesota Power is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in electric sales. 

Power Supply 

In order to meet its customers&#8217; electric requirements, Minnesota Power utilizes a mix of its own generation and purchased power. At December 31, 2015 , Minnesota Power&#8217;s generation is primarily coal-fired, but also includes approximately 180 &#32;MW of natural gas-fired and biomass co-fired generation, 120 &#32;MW of hydroelectric generation, and 522 &#32;MW of nameplate capacity wind energy generation. Purchased power consists of long-term coal, wind and hydro PPAs as well as market purchases. The following table reflects Minnesota Power&#8217;s generating capabilities as of December 31, 2015 , and total electrical output for 2015 . Minnesota Power had an annual net peak load of 1,631 MW on January 4, 2015.

Fuel . Minnesota Power purchases low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin region located in Montana and Wyoming. Coal consumption in 2015 &#32;for electric generation at Minnesota Power&#8217;s coal-fired generating stations was 4.4 million tons. As of December 31, 2015 , Minnesota Power had coal inventories of 1.6 million tons (1.0 million tons as of December 31, 2014 ). Minnesota Power&#8217;s coal supply agreements have expiration dates through 2016 for a significant portion of its coal requirements and 2019 for a portion of its coal requirements. In 2016 , Minnesota Power expects to obtain coal under these coal supply agreements and in the spot market. Minnesota Power also continues to explore other future coal supply options and believes that adequate supplies of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal will continue to be available. 

On January 11, 2016, one of Minnesota Power&#8217;s coal suppliers, Arch Coal, Inc. (Arch Coal), announced that it had filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and that it had reached an agreement with the majority of its senior lenders on the terms of a financial restructuring. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri authorized Arch Coal to enter into and perform under coal contracts in the ordinary course of business. 

Minnesota Power anticipates receiving its contracted fuel from Arch Coal in 2016 and beyond. In the event that circumstances would change, Minnesota Power purchases fuel for its power plants from four large coal producers and believes there are adequate supplies in the marketplace to procure fuel from alternative sources, should it be necessary. Additionally, Minnesota Power has approximately 1.6 million tons of coal inventories as of December 31, 2015 (4.4 million tons consumed in 2015). 

Minnesota Power also has transportation agreements in place for the delivery of a significant portion of its coal requirements. These transportation agreements have expiration dates through 2018. The delivered costs of fuel for Minnesota Power&#8217;s generation are recoverable from Minnesota Power&#8217;s utility customers through the fuel adjustment clause.

Long-Term Purchased Power . Minnesota Power has contracts to purchase capacity and energy from various entities, including output from certain coal, wind and hydro generating facilities. 

Square Butte PPA. &#32;Under the long-term agreement with Square Butte, which expires at the end of 2026, Minnesota Power is entitled to 50 percent of the output of a 455-MW coal-fired generating unit located near Center, North Dakota. (See Note 12. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) BNI Energy supplies lignite coal to Square Butte. This lignite supply is sufficient to provide fuel for the anticipated useful life of the generating unit. Square Butte&#8217;s cost of lignite burned in 2015 &#32;was approximately $1.55 per MBtu. (See Electric Sales / Customers &#32;&#8211; Minnkota Power Sales Agreement .) 

Minnkota Power PPA. &#32;In December 2012, Minnesota Power entered into a long-term PPA with Minnkota Power. Under this agreement, Minnesota Power will purchase 50 MW of capacity and the energy associated with that capacity from June 2016 through May 2020. The agreement includes a fixed capacity charge and energy pricing that escalates at a fixed rate annually over the term. 

Oliver Wind I and II PPAs. Minnesota Power entered into two long-term wind PPAs with an affiliate of NextEra Energy, Inc. to purchase the output from Oliver Wind I ( 50 &#32;MW) and Oliver Wind II ( 48 &#32;MW) wind energy facilities located near Center, North Dakota, that expire in 2031 and 2032, respectively. Each agreement provides for the purchase of all output from the facilities at fixed energy prices. There are no &#32;fixed capacity charges, and Minnesota Power only pays for energy as it is delivered. 

Manitoba Hydro PPAs. &#32;Minnesota Power has five long-term PPAs with Manitoba Hydro. The first PPA expires in May 2020 . Under this agreement, Minnesota Power is purchasing 50 &#32;MW of capacity and the energy associated with that capacity. Both the capacity price and the energy price are adjusted annually by the change in a governmental inflationary index. Under the second PPA, Minnesota Power is purchasing surplus energy through April 2022 . This energy-only agreement primarily consists of surplus hydro energy on Manitoba Hydro&#8217;s system that is delivered to Minnesota Power on a non-firm basis. The pricing is based on forward market prices. Under this agreement, Minnesota Power will purchase at least one million &#32;MWh of energy over the contract term.

Long-Term Purchased Power (Continued) 

In May 2011, Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro signed a third PPA. This PPA provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 250 MW of capacity and energy from Manitoba Hydro for 15 &#32;years beginning in 2020. The agreement is subject to construction of additional transmission capacity between Manitoba and the U.S., along with construction of new hydroelectric generating capacity in Manitoba. In September 2015, Manitoba Hydro submitted the final preferred route and EIS for the additional transmission capacity in Canada to the Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship for regulatory approval. Construction of Manitoba Hydro&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facility commenced in 2014. (See Transmission and Distribution &#8211; Great Northern Transmission Line .) The capacity price is adjusted annually until 2020 by the change in a governmental inflationary index. The energy price is based on a formula that includes an annual fixed price component adjusted for the change in a governmental inflationary index and a natural gas index, as well as market prices. 

In July 2014, Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro signed a fourth PPA that provides for Minnesota Power to purchase up to 133 MW of energy from Manitoba Hydro for 20 &#32;years beginning in 2020. The pricing under this PPA is based on forward market prices. The PPA was approved by the MPUC in an order dated January 30, 2015, and is subject to the construction of the GNTL. 

In October 2015, Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro signed a fifth PPA that provides for Minnesota Power to purchase 50 MW of capacity at fixed prices. The PPA begins in June 2017 and expires in May 2020. 

Great River Energy PPAs. In August 2014, January 2015 and October 2015, Minnesota Power and Great River Energy signed long-term PPAs that provide for Minnesota Power to purchase 50 &#32;MW of capacity and energy under the first PPA, 50 &#32;MW of capacity only under the second PPA, and 50 &#32;MW of capacity only under the third PPA. The first and second PPAs begin in June 2016 and expire in May 2020, and the third PPA begins in June 2017 and expires in May 2020. All of these contracts have fixed capacity pricing. The energy price in the first PPA is based on a formula that includes an annual fixed price component adjusted for changes in a natural gas index as well as market prices. 

TransAlta PPAs. &#32;In September 2015, Minnesota Power and TransAlta signed PPAs that provide for Minnesota Power to purchase 50 &#32;MW of energy during off-peak hours and 100 &#32;MW of energy during on-peak hours beginning in January 2017 and expiring through December 2019. The energy prices are fixed throughout the terms of the PPAs. 

Transmission and Distribution 

We have electric transmission and distribution lines of 500 kV (8 miles), 345 kV (242 miles), 250 kV (465 miles), 230 kV (765 miles), 161 kV (43 miles), 138 kV (130 miles), 115 kV (1,268 miles) and less than 115 kV (6,295 miles). We own and operate 177 substations with a total capacity of 10,980 megavoltamperes. Some of our transmission and distribution lines interconnect with other utilities. 

CapX2020. &#32;Minnesota Power is a participant in the CapX2020 initiative which represents an effort to ensure electric transmission and distribution reliability in Minnesota and the surrounding region for the future. CapX2020, which consists of electric cooperatives and municipal and investor-owned utilities, including Minnesota&#8217;s largest transmission owners, has assessed the transmission system and projected growth in customer demand for electricity through 2020. 

On April 2, 2015, the CapX2020 transmission line project from Fargo, North Dakota, to St. Cloud, Minnesota, was completed and placed in service. Minnesota Power previously participated in two &#32;additional CapX2020 projects which were completed and placed in service in 2011 and 2012. 

Minnesota Power invested approximately $100 million &#32;to complete the three &#32;transmission line projects. As future CapX2020 projects are identified, Minnesota Power may participate on a project-by-project basis. 

Great Northern Transmission Line (GNTL). &#32;As a condition of the long-term PPA signed in May 2011 with Manitoba Hydro, construction of additional transmission capacity is required. As a result, Minnesota Power and Manitoba Hydro proposed construction of the GNTL, an approximately 220 -mile 500 kV transmission line between Manitoba and Minnesota&#8217;s Iron Range in order to strengthen the electric grid, enhance regional reliability and promote a greater exchange of sustainable energy.

Transmission and Distribution (Continued) 

The GNTL is subject to various federal and state regulatory approvals. In October 2013, a certificate of need application was filed with the MPUC which was approved in an order dated June 30, 2015. Based on this order, Minnesota Power&#8217;s portion of the investments and expenditures for the project are eligible for cost recovery under its existing transmission cost recovery rider and are anticipated to be included in future transmission factor filings. In an order dated December 17, 2015, the FERC approved our request to recover on construction work in progress related to the GNTL from Minnesota Power&#8217;s wholesale customers. In April 2014, Minnesota Power filed a route permit application with the MPUC and a request for a presidential permit to cross the U.S.-Canadian border with the U.S. Department of Energy. In a July 2014 order, the MPUC determined the route permit application to be complete. On October 30, 2015, the Minnesota Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Energy released the final EIS for the GNTL. On January 4, 2016, an administrative law judge recommended approval of the route permit for the GNTL. A final decision on the route permit by the MPUC is expected in the first quarter of 2016. Manitoba Hydro must also obtain regulatory and governmental approvals related to a new transmission line in Canada. In September 2015, Manitoba Hydro submitted the final preferred route and EIS for the transmission line in Canada to the Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship for regulatory approval. Construction of Manitoba Hydro&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facility commenced in 2014. Upon receipt of all applicable permits and approvals, construction of the GNTL is expected to begin by 2017 and to be completed in 2020. Total project cost in the U.S., including substation work, is estimated to be between $560 million &#32;and $710 million , depending on the final route of the line. Minnesota Power is expected to have majority ownership of the transmission line. 

Investment in ATC 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ALLETE Transmission Holdings, owns approximately 8 percent of ATC, a Wisconsin-based utility that owns and maintains electric transmission assets in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. We account for our investment in ATC under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2015 , our equity investment in ATC was $124.5 million &#32;( $121.1 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 ). (See Note 6. Investment in ATC.) 

Our equity earnings in ATC for the year ended December 31, 2015 , were $16.3 million &#32;and reflected a $5.2 million &#32;reduction related to complaints filed with the FERC by several customer groups located within the MISO service area; of which $2.4 million &#32;was attributable to ATC&#8217;s change in estimate of a refund liability relating to prior years. The groups requested, among other things, a reduction in the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 9.15 percent . ATC's current authorized return on equity is 12.2 percent . On February 12, 2015, an additional complaint was filed with the FERC seeking an order to further reduce the base return on equity to 8.67 percent . On December 29, 2015, a federal administrative law judge ruled that the MISO transmission users have been charged an unreasonable base return on equity and proposed a reduction to 10.32 percent, subject to approval or adjustment by the FERC. A final decision from the FERC on the administrative law judge&#8217;s recommendation is currently expected in 2016. We own approximately 8 percent &#32;of ATC and estimate that for every 50 basis point reduction in ATC&#8217;s allowed return on equity our equity earnings in ATC would be impacted annually by approximately $0.5 million &#32;on an after-tax basis ( $0.9 million &#32;pre-tax). 

ATC&#8217;s 10-year transmission assessment, which covers the years 2015 through 2024, identifies a need for between $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion in transmission system investments. These investments by ATC are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated cash, debt and investor contributions. As opportunities arise, we plan to make additional investments in ATC through general capital calls based upon our pro rata ownership interest in ATC. 

ATC and Duke Energy Corporation are partners in a joint venture, Duke-American Transmission Co. (DATC) which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. DATC is subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, various independent system operators and state regulatory authorities. 

Properties 

Our Regulated Operations businesses own office and service buildings, an energy control center, repair shops and storerooms in various localities. All of the electric plants are subject to mortgages, which collateralize the outstanding first mortgage bonds of Minnesota Power and SWL&#38;P. Most of the generating plants and substations are located on real property owned by Minnesota Power or SWL&#38;P, subject to the lien of a mortgage, whereas most of the electric lines are located on real property owned by others with appropriate easement rights or necessary permits from governmental authorities. WPPI Energy owns 20 percent of Boswell Unit 4. WPPI Energy has the right to use our transmission line facilities to transport its share of Boswell generation. (See Note 4. Jointly-Owned Facilities and Projects.)

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory authorities and other organizations. The MPUC has regulatory authority over Minnesota Power&#8217;s retail service area in Minnesota, retail rates, retail services, capital structure, issuance of securities and other matters. The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power&#8217;s municipal customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record-keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities, and the operations of ATC. The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization and has jurisdiction over certain aspects of our Regulated Operations&#8217; generation and transmission operations, including cybersecurity relating to generation and transmission reliability. The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&#38;P&#8217;s retail sales of electricity, natural gas, water, issuances of securities, and other matters. The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities necessary for construction in North Dakota. 

Electric Rates. &#32;All rates and contract terms in our Regulated Operations are subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities. Minnesota Power designs its retail electric service rates based on cost of service studies under which allocations are made to the various classes of customers as approved by the MPUC. Nearly all retail sales include billing adjustment clauses, which adjust electric service rates for changes in the cost of fuel and purchased energy, recovery of current and deferred conservation improvement program &#160; expenditures and recovery of certain environmental, transmission and renewable expenditures. 

Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. 

2010 Rate Case. Minnesota Power&#8217;s current retail rates are based on a 2011 MPUC retail rate order, effective June 1, 2011 , that allows for a 10.38 &#32;percent return on common equity and a 54.29 &#32;percent equity ratio. Subsequent to this last order, and as authorized by the MPUC, Minnesota Power has increased revenue under cost recovery riders for environmental, renewable and transmission investments. (See Transmission Cost Recovery Rider, Renewable Cost Recovery Rider and Boswell Mercury Emissions Reduction Plan .) Revenue from cost recovery riders was $86.0 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;( $69.9 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $40.5 million &#32;in 2013 ). 

Energy-Intensive Trade-Exposed (EITE) Customer Rates. &#32;The Minnesota Legislature enacted EITE customer ratemaking legislation in June 2015. The legislation establishes that it is the energy policy of the state to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. On November 13, 2015, Minnesota Power filed a rate schedule for EITE customers and a corresponding rider for EITE cost recovery with the MPUC. The rate proposal is revenue, and cash flow, neutral. On February 11, 2016, the MPUC dismissed the petition without prejudice, offering Minnesota Power the option to refile the petition with additional information or initiate a new petition. Minnesota Power is evaluating the MPUC&#8217;s decision. 

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider. Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place for certain transmission investments and expenditures. In an order dated February 3, 2016, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power&#8217;s updated billing factor which allows Minnesota Power to charge retail customers on a current basis for the costs of constructing certain transmission facilities plus a return on the capital invested. As a result of the MPUC approval of the certificate of need for the GNTL on June 30, 2015, the project is eligible for cost recovery under the existing transmission cost recovery rider. Minnesota Power anticipates including its portion of the investments and expenditures for the GNTL in future transmission factor filings to include updated billing rates on customer bills. (See Transmission and Distribution &#8211; Great Northern Transmission Line. ) 

Renewable Cost Recovery Rider. &#32;Minnesota Power has an approved cost recovery rider in place for investments and expenditures related to the 497 &#32;MW Bison Wind Energy Center in North Dakota. Customer billing rates for the Bison Wind Energy Center were approved by the MPUC in an order dated May 22, 2015. In November 2014, Minnesota Power filed a renewable resources factor filing which includes updated costs associated with Bison. Upon approval of the filing, Minnesota Power will be authorized to include updated billing rates on customer bills. 

On February 13, 2015, Minnesota Power supplemented its November 2014 renewable resources factor filing to include costs associated with the restoration and repair of Thomson. In an order dated March 5, 2015, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power&#8217;s petition seeking cost recovery for investments and expenditures related to the restoration and repair of Thomson through a renewable resources rider. 

Annual Automatic Adjustment (AAA) of Charges. &#32;Minnesota Power&#8217;s AAA filings made in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 are pending MPUC approval, and represent approximately $700 million &#32;in retail fuel cost recovery collected but subject to refund. These filings have historically been approved, and Minnesota Power currently expects full recovery of amounts represented by each AAA filing, although we cannot predict the outcome of the filings at the MPUC.

Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). &#32;In a November 2013 order, the MPUC approved Minnesota Power&#8217;s 2013 IRP which detailed its EnergyForward &#32;strategic plan, announced in January 2013. Significant elements of the EnergyForward &#32;plan include major wind investments in North Dakota which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, the installation of emissions control technology at Boswell Unit 4 completed in December 2015, planning for the proposed GNTL, the conversion of Laskin from coal to natural gas completed in June 2015 and the retirement of Taconite Harbor Unit 3 completed in May 2015. On September 1, 2015, Minnesota Power filed its 2015 IRP with the MPUC which contains the next steps in its EnergyForward &#32;strategic plan, and includes an analysis of a variety of existing and future energy resource alternatives and a projection of customer cost impact by class. (See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Outlook &#8211; EnergyForward.) 

Boswell Mercury Emissions Reduction Plan. In August 2012, Minnesota Power filed its mercury emissions reduction plan for Boswell Unit 4 with the MPUC and the MPCA in order to comply with the Minnesota Mercury Emissions Reduction Act and the Federal MATS rule. Construction on the project to implement the Boswell Unit 4 mercury emissions reduction plan was completed with project costs totaling approximately $220 million &#32;through December 31, 2015 . In a November 2013 order, the MPUC approved the Boswell Unit 4 mercury emissions reduction plan and cost recovery, establishing an environmental improvement rider. Customer billing rates for the environmental improvement rider were approved by the MPUC in an order dated August 24, 2015. On September 30, 2015, Minnesota Power filed an updated environmental improvement factor filing which included updated costs associated with Boswell Unit 4. Upon approval of the filing, Minnesota Power will be authorized to include updated billing rates on customer bills. 

Boswell Remaining Life Petition. On November 17, 2015, Minnesota Power filed a petition with the MPUC for approval to extend Boswell&#8217;s remaining life to 2050 for all units and utilize the existing environmental improvement rider to credit a portion of the depreciation expense savings to customers. The extension request is based on the significant multi-emissions retrofit work done at Boswell Unit 3 and Boswell Unit 4. 

Conservation Improvement Program (CIP). &#32;Minnesota requires electric utilities to spend a minimum of 1.5 percent of net gross operating revenues from service provided in the state on energy CIPs each year. These investments are recovered from certain retail customers through a combination of the conservation cost recovery charge included in retail base rates and a conservation program adjustment, which is adjusted annually through the CIP consolidated filing. The MPUC allows utilities to accumulate, in a deferred account for future cost recovery, all CIP expenditures, any financial incentive earned for cost-effective program achievements, and a carrying charge on the deferred account balance. Minnesota Power refers to its conservation programs collectively as the &#8220;Power of One&#8221;. In June 2013, Minnesota Power submitted a triennial filing for 2014 through 2016, which was subsequently approved by the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Minnesota Power&#8217;s CIP investment goal was $7.1 million &#32;for 2015 ( $6.9 million &#32;for 2014; $6.0 million &#32;for 2013), with actual spending of $6.6 million &#32;in 2015 ( $7.2 million &#32;in 2014; $6.4 million &#32;in 2013). The investment goal for 2016 is $7.3 million . 

Minnesota requires each utility to establish an annual energy-savings goal of 1.5 percent &#32;of annual retail energy sales. On April 1, 2015, Minnesota Power submitted its 2014 CIP filing that requested a CIP financial incentive of $6.2 million . The requested CIP financial incentive was approved by the MPUC in an order dated September 16, 2015, and was recorded as revenue and as a regulatory asset. The approved financial incentive will be recovered through customer billing rates in 2015 and 2016. In 2014 and 2013, the CIP financial incentive recognized was $8.7 million &#32;and $7.1 million , respectively. CIP financial incentives are recognized in the period in which the MPUC approves the filing. The MPUC implemented certain limitations on amounts recoverable for the utility performance incentive program for recovery years beginning in 2015. 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &#32;The FERC has jurisdiction over the licensing of hydroelectric projects, the establishment of rates and charges for transmission of electricity in interstate commerce and electricity sold at wholesale (including the rates for Minnesota Power&#8217;s municipal and wholesale customers), natural gas transportation, certain accounting and record-keeping practices, certain activities of our regulated utilities, and the operations of ATC. FERC jurisdiction also includes enforcement of NERC mandatory electric reliability standards. Violations of FERC rules are subject to enforcement action by the FERC including financial penalties up to $1 million per day per violation.

MISO Return on Equity Complaints. &#32; In November 2013, several customer groups located within the MISO service area filed complaints with the FERC requesting, among other things, a reduction in the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ALLETE, to &#32; 9.15 percent . &#32; On February 12, 2015, an additional complaint was filed with the FERC seeking an order to further reduce the base return on equity to 8.67 percent . On December 29, 2015, a federal administrative law judge ruled that the MISO transmission users have been charged an unreasonable base return on equity and proposed a reduction to 10.32 percent, subject to approval or adjustment by the FERC. A final decision from the FERC on the administrative law judge&#8217;s recommendation is expected in 2016. As a result of these complaints filed with the FERC and the administrative law judge&#8217;s recommendation , Minnesota Power has recorded an estimated refund obligation for MISO revenue of $7.2 million &#32;and an estimated refund for MISO transmission expense of $4.5 million , resulting in a reserve of $2.7 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 ; $1.5 million &#32;was attributable to prior years. 

Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. &#32;The PSCW has regulatory authority over SWL&#38;P&#8217;s retail sales of electricity, natural gas and water, issuances of securities and other matters. SWL&#38;P&#8217;s current retail rates are based on a 2012 PSCW retail rate order, effective January 1, 2013, that allows for a 10.9 &#32;percent return on common equity. 

North Dakota Public Service Commission. &#32;The NDPSC has jurisdiction over site and route permitting of generation and transmission facilities in North Dakota. 

Regional Organizations 

Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. &#32;Minnesota Power and SWL&#38;P are members of MISO, a regional transmission organization. While Minnesota Power and SWL&#38;P retain ownership of their respective transmission assets, their transmission networks are under the regional operational control of MISO. Minnesota Power and SWL&#38;P take and provide transmission service under the MISO open access transmission tariff. MISO continues its efforts to oversee the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba which includes nearly 175,000 MW of generating capacity. 

North American Electric Reliability Corporation. &#32;The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC ensures the reliability of the North American bulk power system. The NERC oversees eight regional entities that establish requirements, approved by the FERC, for reliable operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and transmission systems. Minnesota Power is subject to these reliability requirements and can incur significant penalties for non-compliance. 

Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO). &#32; Minnesota &#32; Power &#32; is a member of the MRO, one of the eight regional entities overseen by the NERC. MRO's primary responsibilities are to: ensure compliance with mandatory reliability standards by entities who own, operate, or use the interconnected, international Bulk Power System; conduct assessments of the grid's ability to meet electricity demand in the region; and analyze regional system events. 

The MRO region spans the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and all or parts of the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. The region includes more than 130 organizations that are involved in the production and delivery of power to more than 20 million people. These organizations include municipal utilities, cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, transmission system operators, a federal power marketing agency, Canadian Crown corporations, and independent power producers. 

Minnesota Legislation 

Renewable Energy. In February 2007, Minnesota enacted a law requiring 25 percent of electric utilities&#8217; applicable retail and municipal energy sales in Minnesota to be from renewable energy sources by 2025. The law also requires Minnesota Power to meet interim milestones of 12 percent by 2012, 17 percent by 2016 and 20 percent by 2020. The law allows the MPUC to modify or delay meeting a milestone if implementation will cause significant ratepayer cost or technical reliability issues. If a utility is not in compliance with a milestone, the MPUC may order the utility to construct facilities, purchase renewable energy or purchase renewable energy credits. Minnesota Power&#8217;s 2015 IRP, which was filed with the MPUC on September 1, 2015, includes an update on its plans and progress in meeting the Minnesota renewable energy milestones through 2025. (See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Outlook &#8211; EnergyForward.)

Minnesota Power continues to execute its renewable energy strategy through key renewable projects that will ensure it meets the identified state mandate at the lowest cost for customers. Minnesota Power has exceeded the interim milestone requirements to date with approximately 27 percent of its applicable retail and municipal energy sales supplied by renewable energy sources in 2015. 

Minnesota Solar Energy Standard. &#32;In May 2013, legislation was enacted by the state of Minnesota requiring at least 1.5 percent of total retail electric sales, excluding sales to certain industrial customers, to be generated by solar energy by the end of 2020. At least 10 percent of the 1.5 percent mandate must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 20 kilowatts or less. Minnesota Power has two solar projects under development. On August 21, 2015, Minnesota Power filed for MPUC approval of a 10 MW utility scale solar project at Camp Ripley, a Minnesota Army National Guard base and training facility near Little Falls, Minnesota. At a hearing on January 28, 2016, the MPUC approved the Camp Ripley solar project as eligible to meet the solar energy standard and for current cost recovery, subject to certain compliance requirements. On September 10, 2015, Minnesota Power filed for MPUC approval of a 1 MW community solar garden project in Saint Louis County, Minnesota. If the community solar garden project is also approved, Minnesota Power believes these projects will meet approximately one-third of the overall mandate and approximately one-fourth of the mandate related to solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 20 kilowatts or less. Costs associated with these projects are expected to be recovered from customers. 

Energy-Intensive Trade-Exposed (EITE) Customer Rates. &#32;The Minnesota Legislature enacted EITE customer ratemaking legislation in June 2015. The legislation establishes that it is the energy policy of the state to have competitive rates for certain industries such as mining and forest products. On November 13, 2015, Minnesota Power filed a rate schedule for EITE customers and a corresponding rider for EITE cost recovery with the MPUC. The rate proposal is revenue, and cash flow, neutral. On February 11, 2016, the MPUC dismissed the petition without prejudice, offering Minnesota Power the option to refile the petition with additional information or initiate a new petition. Minnesota Power is evaluating the MPUC&#8217;s decision. 

Competition 

Retail electric energy sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin are made to customers in assigned service territories. As a result, most retail electric customers in Minnesota do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. Large energy users of 2 MW and above that are located outside of a municipality are allowed to choose a supplier upon MPUC approval. Minnesota Power serves 11 Large Power facilities over 10 MW, none of which have engaged in a competitive rate process. No other large commercial or small industrial customers in Minnesota Power&#8217;s service territory have sought a provider outside Minnesota Power&#8217;s service territory since 1994. Retail electric and natural gas customers in Wisconsin do not have the ability to choose their energy supplier. In both states, however, electricity may compete with other forms of energy. Customers may also choose to generate their own electricity, or substitute other forms of energy for their manufacturing processes. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 6 percent &#32;of our Regulated Operations&#8217; electric energy sales were to municipal customers in Minnesota by contract. These customers have the right to seek an energy supply from any wholesale electric service provider upon contract expiration. In April 2015, Minnesota Power amended its formula-based wholesale electric sales contract with the Nashwauk Public Utilities Commission, extending the term through June 30, 2028. In September 2015, Minnesota Power amended its wholesale electric contracts with 14 &#32;of its municipal customers, extending the contract terms through December 31, 2024. In January 2016, one of Minnesota Power&#8217;s municipal customers provided notice of its intent to terminate its contract effective June 30, 2019. Minnesota Power currently provides approximately 29 MW of average monthly demand to this customer. (See Electric Sales / Customers. ) 

The FERC has continued with its efforts to promote a more competitive wholesale market through open-access electric transmission and other means. As a result, our electric sales to Other Power Suppliers and our purchases to supply our retail and wholesale load are made in the competitive market. 

Franchises 

Minnesota Power holds franchises to construct and maintain an electric distribution and transmission system in 91 cities. The remaining cities, villages and towns served by Minnesota Power do not require a franchise to operate. SWL&#38;P serves customers under electric, natural gas and/or water franchises in 1 city and 14 villages or towns.

U.S. Water Services 

On February 10, 2015, ALLETE acquired U.S. Water Services. Headquartered in St. Michael, Minnesota, U.S. Water Services provides integrated water management for industry by combining chemical, equipment, engineering and service for customized solutions to reduce water and energy usage and improve efficiency. U.S. Water Services is located in 49 states and Canada and has an established base of approximately 4,000 customers. U.S. Water Services differentiates itself from the competition by developing synergies between established solutions in engineering, equipment, and chemical water treatment and helping customers achieve efficient and sustainable use of their water and energy systems. U.S. Water Services is a leading provider to the biofuels industry, and also serves the food and beverage, industrial, power generation, and midstream oil and gas industries. U.S. Water Services principally relies upon recurring revenue from a diverse mix of industrial customers. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER 

Corporate and Other &#32; is comprised of BNI Energy, our coal mining operations in North Dakota, ALLETE Properties, our legacy Florida real estate investment, other business development and corporate expenditures, unallocated interest expense, a small amount of non-rate base generation, approximately 5,000 acres of land in Minnesota, and earnings on cash and investments. (See Outlook.) 

BNI Energy 

BNI Energy is a supplier of lignite in North Dakota, producing approximately 4 million tons annually and has lignite reserves of an estimated 650 million tons. Two electric generating cooperatives, Minnkota Power and Square Butte, presently consume virtually all of BNI Energy&#8217;s production of lignite under cost-plus fixed fee coal supply agreements extending to December 31, 2037. (See Item 1. Business &#8211; Regulated Operations &#8211; Power Supply &#8211; Long-Term Purchased Power and Note 12. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) The mining process disturbs and reclaims between 200 and 250 acres per year. Laws require that the reclaimed land be at least as productive as it was prior to mining. As of December 31, 2015 , BNI Energy had a $22.1 million asset reclamation obligation ($20.3 million at December 31, 2014 ) included in Other Non-Current Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs are included in the cost-plus fixed fee contract, for which an asset reclamation cost receivable was included in Other Non-Current Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The asset reclamation obligation is guaranteed by surety bonds and a letter of credit. (See Note 12. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.)

CORPORATE AND OTHER (Continued) 

ALLETE Properties 

ALLETE Properties represents our legacy Florida real estate investment. Our strategy for ALLETE Properties has been to complete and maintain key entitlements and infrastructure improvements without requiring significant additional investment, and sell assets in the portfolio over time in order to optimize cash flows in support of future investment opportunities and growth initiatives. 

In recent years, market conditions for real estate in Florida have required us to review our land inventories for impairment. In response to market conditions and recent transaction activity, during the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company reevaluated its strategy related to the real estate assets of ALLETE Properties. The revised strategy incorporates the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio which, if consummated, is likely to result in sales proceeds below the book value of the real estate assets. ALLETE also continues to pursue sales of individual parcels over time. Proceeds from such a sale would be strategically deployed to support growth in our energy infrastructure and related services businesses. ALLETE will continue to maintain key entitlements and infrastructure without making additional investments or acquisitions. 

In connection with implementing the revised strategy in 2015, management evaluated its impairment analysis for its real estate assets using updated assumptions to determine estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis. Future net cash flows were adjusted to consider the possibility of a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, in addition to sales over time under the existing divestiture plan. Estimated fair values were based upon current market data and pricing for individual parcels. Our impairment analysis incorporates a probability-weighted approach considering the alternative courses of sales noted above. 

Based on the results of undiscounted cash flow analysis, the undiscounted future net cash flows were not adequate to recover the carrying value of the real estate assets totaling $83.3 million. Estimated fair value was derived from current market interest in the property for a bulk sale of its entire portfolio, and discounted cash flow analysis of estimated selling price for sales over time. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of $36.3 million was recorded in 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated fair value at December 31, 2015. 

If our real estate assets are sold differently than anticipated, the actual results could be materially different from our undiscounted future net cash flow analysis. 

In 2014 and 2013, impairment analyses of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows were conducted based on the strategy existing at that time, and indicated that the cash flows were adequate to recover the carrying value of ALLETE Properties real estate assets. As a result, no impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

ALLETE Properties&#8217; major projects are Town Center, Palm Coast Park and Ormond Crossings. Separately, the Lake Swamp wetland mitigation bank was permitted on land that was previously part of Ormond Crossings. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Outlook for more information on ALLETE Properties&#8217; land holdings. 

Seller Financing. &#32;ALLETE Properties occasionally provides seller financing to certain qualified buyers. At December 31, 2015 , outstanding finance receivables were $1.6 million , net of reserves, with maturities through 2017 . These finance receivables accrue interest at market-based rates and are collateralized by the financed properties. 

Regulation. &#32;A substantial portion of our development properties in Florida are subject to federal, state and local regulations, and restrictions that may impose significant costs or limitations on our ability to develop the properties. Much of our property is vacant land and some is located in areas where development may affect the natural habitats of various protected wildlife species or in sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Our businesses are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal, state and local authorities. Currently, a number of regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and various waste management requirements are under consideration or have already been promulgated by both the EPA and state authorities. Minnesota Power&#8217;s facilities are subject to additional regulation under many of these proposals. In preparation and response to these regulations, Minnesota Power is reshaping its generation portfolio over time to reduce its reliance on coal, has installed cost-effective emission control technology, and advocates for sound science and policy during rulemaking implementation. 

We consider our businesses to be in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and believe all necessary permits to conduct such operations have been obtained. We anticipate that although many of the state and federal environmental regulations have been finalized, or will be finalized in the near future, potential expenditures for future environmental matters may be material and may require significant capital investments. Minnesota Power has evaluated various environmental compliance scenarios using possible ranges of future environmental regulations to project power supply trends and impacts on customers. 

We review environmental matters on a quarterly basis. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. Accruals are adjusted as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are charged to expense unless recoverable in rates from customers. (See Note 12. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.) 

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015 , ALLETE had 1,945 employees, of which 1,923 were full-time. 

Minnesota Power and SWL&#38;P have an aggregate of 554 employees who are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 31. The current labor agreements with IBEW Local 31 expire on January 31, 2018.
