 Item 1. Business . 

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K for the year ended December 31, 2015. This discussion contains forward &#8209;looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward &#8209;looking statements due to the factors set forth in &#x201C;Risk Factors&#x201D; and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K. References in this Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K to &#x201C;we,&#x201D; &#x201C;our,&#x201D; &#x201C;us,&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Company&#x201D; refer to Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

General 

Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (&#x201C;STWD&#x201D; and, together with its subsidiaries, &#x201C;we&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;) is a Maryland corporation that commenced operations in August 2009, upon the completion of our initial public offering (&#x201C;IPO&#x201D;). We are focused primarily on originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments, commercial mortgage &#8209;backed securities (&#x201C;CMBS&#x201D;), and other commercial real estate investments in both the U.S. and Europe. We refer to the following as our target assets: commercial real estate mortgage loans, preferred equity interests, CMBS and other commercial real estate &#8209;related debt investments. Our target assets may also include residential mortgage &#8209;backed securities (&#x201C;RMBS&#x201D;), certain residential mortgage loans, distressed or non &#8209;performing commercial loans, commercial properties subject to net leases and equity interests in commercial real estate. As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions. 

We have three reportable business segments as of December 31, 201 5 : 

&#xB7; 

Real estate lending (the &#x201C;Lending Segment&#x201D;)&#x2014; engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial first mortgages, subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, CMBS, RMBS and other real estate and real estate-related debt investments in both the U.S. and Europe that are held-for-investment. 

&#xB7; 

Real estate investing and servicing (the &#x201C;Inve sting and Servicing Segment&#x201D;) &#x2014; includes (i) servicing businesses in both the U.S. and Europe that manage and work out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization transactions, and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts. This segment excludes the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities (&#x201C;VIEs&#x201D;). 

&#xB7; 

Real estate property (the &#x201C;Property Segment&#x201D;) &#x2014;engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized commercial real estate properties, including multi-family properties, that are held for investment. 

On January 31, 2014, we completed the spin &#8209;off of our former single family residential (&#x201C;SFR &#x201D;) segment to our stockholders as discussed further in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included herein (our &#x201C;Consolidated Financial Statements&#x201D;). 

On April 19, 2013, we acquired the equity of LNR Property LLC (&#x201C;LNR&#x201D;) and certain of its subsidiaries as discussed further in Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (&#x201C;REIT&#x201D;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#x201C;Code&#x201D;). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements. We also operate 

our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the &#x201C;Investment Company Act&#x201D; or &#x201C;1940 Act&#x201D;). 

We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various wholly &#8209;owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our &#x201C;Manager&#x201D;) pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately &#8209;held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. 

Our corporate headquarters office is located at 591 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut, and our telephone number is (203) 422 &#8209;7700. 

Investment Strategy 

We seek to attain attractive risk &#8209;adjusted returns for our investors over the long term by sourcing and managing a diversified portfolio of target assets, financed in a manner that is designed to deliver attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. Our investment strategy focuses on a few fundamental themes: 

&#xB7; 

origination and acquisition of real estate debt assets with an implied basis sufficiently low to weather declines in asset values; 

&#xB7; 

focus on real estate markets and asset classes with strong supply and demand fundamentals and/or barriers to entry; 

&#xB7; 

structuring and financing each transaction in a manner that reflects the risk of the underlying asset&#x2019;s cash flow stream and credit risk profile, and efficiently managing and maintaining the transaction&#x2019;s interest rate and currency exposures at levels consistent with management&#x2019;s risk objectives; 

&#xB7; 

seeking situations where our size, scale, speed, and sophistication allow us to position ourselves as a &#x201C;one &#8209;stop&#x201D; lending solution for real estate owner/operators; 

&#xB7; 

utilizing the skills, expertise, and contacts developed by our Manager over the past 20 plus years as one of the premier global real estate investment managers to correctly anticipate trends and identify attractive risk &#8209;adjusted investment opportunities in U.S. and European real estate markets; and 

&#xB7; 

utilizing the skills, expertise, and infrastructure we acquired through our acquisition of LNR, a market leading diversified real estate investment management and loan servicing company, to expand and diversify our presence in various segments of real estate, including: 

&#xB7; 

origination of small and medium sized loan transactions ($10 million to $50 million) for both investment and securitization/gain &#8209;on &#8209;sale; 

&#xB7; 

investment in CMBS; 

&#xB7; 

investment in commercial real estate; and 

&#xB7; 

special servicing of commercial real estate loans in commercial real estate securitization transactions. 

In order to capitalize on the changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle, we may expand or refocus our investment strategy by emphasizing investments in different parts of the capital structure and different sectors of real estate. Our investment strategy may be amended from time to time, if recommended by our Manager and approved by our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders. In 

addition to our Manager making direct investments on our behalf, we may enter into joint venture, management or other agreements with persons that have special expertise or sourcing capabilities. 

Financing Strategy 

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registering under the 1940 Act, we may finance the acquisition of our target assets, to the extent available to us, through the following methods: 

&#xB7; 

sources of private and government sponsored financing, including long and short &#8209;term repurchase agreements, warehouse and bank credit facilities, and mortgage loans on equity interests in commercial real estate properties; 

&#xB7; 

loan sales, syndications, and/or securitizations; and 

&#xB7; 

public or private offerings of our equity and/or debt securities. 

We may also utilize other sources of financing to the extent available to us. 

Our Target Assets 

We invest in target assets secured primarily by U.S. or European collateral. We focus primarily on originating or opportunistically acquiring commercial mortgage whole loans, B &#8209;Notes, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and mortgage &#8209;backed securities. We may invest in performing and non &#8209;performing mortgage loans and other real estate &#8209;related loans and debt investments. We may acquire target assets through portfolio or other acquisitions. Our Manager targets desirable markets where it has expertise in the real estate collateral underlying the assets being acquired. Our target assets include the following types of loans and other investments with respect to commercial real estate: 

&#xB7; 

Whole mortgage loans: loans secured by a first mortgage lien on a commercial property that provide mortgage financing to commercial property developers or owners generally having maturity dates ranging from three to 10 years; 

&#xB7; 

B &#8209;Notes: typically a privately negotiated loan that is secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or group of related properties and subordinated to an A Note secured by the same first mortgage on the same property or group; 

&#xB7; 

Mezzanine loans: loans made to commercial property owners that are secured by pledges of the borrower&#x2019;s ownership interests in the property and/or the property owner, subordinate to whole mortgage loans secured by first or second mortgage liens on the property and senior to the borrower&#x2019;s equity in the property; 

&#xB7; 

Construction or rehabilitation loans: mortgage loans and mezzanine loans to finance the cost of construction or rehabilitation of a commercial property; 

&#xB7; 

CMBS: securities that are collateralized by commercial mortgage loans, including: 

&#xB7; 

senior and subordinated investment grade CMBS, 

&#xB7; 

below investment grade CMBS, and 

&#xB7; 

unrated CMBS; 

&#xB7; 

Corporate bank debt: term loans and revolving credit facilities of commercial real estate operating or finance companies, each of which are generally secured by such companies&#x2019; assets; 

&#xB7; 

Corporate bonds: debt securities issued by commercial real estate operating or finance companies that may or may not be secured by such companies&#x2019; assets, including: 

&#xB7; 

investment grade corporate bonds, 

&#xB7; 

below investment grade corporate bonds, and 

&#xB7; 

unrated corporate bonds; 

&#xB7; 

Equity: equity interests in commercial real estate properties. 

We have also invested in the following types of loans and other debt investments relating to residential real estate: 

&#xB7; 

Non &#8209;Agency RMBS: securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation; and 

&#xB7; 

Residential mortgage loans: loans secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property. 

In addition, we may invest in the following real estate-related investments: 

&#xB7; 

Net leases: commercial properties subject to net leases, which leases typically have longer terms than gross leases, require tenants to pay substantially all of the operating costs associated with the properties and often have contractually specified rent increases throughout their terms; 

&#xB7; 

Agency RMBS: RMBS for which a U.S. government agency or a federally chartered corporation guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities; 

&#xB7; 

Commercial real estate owned (&#x201C;REO&#x201D;): commercial properties purchased from CMBS trusts; and 

&#xB7; 

Commercial non &#8209;performing loans (&#x201C;NPLs&#x201D;): as part of our efforts to attain additional servicing rights in Europe, we may acquire a minority interest in portfolios of NPLs, alongside other majority investors.

We currently operate our business in three reportable segments: the Lending Segment, the Investing and Servicing Segment and the Property Segment. Refer to Note 23 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for our results of operations and financial position by business segment.

First mortgages include first mortgage loans and any contiguous mezzanine loan components because as a whole, the expected credit quality of these loans is more similar to that of a first mortgage loan. The application of this methodology resulted in mezzanine loans with carrying values of $930.0 million and $704.2 million being classified as first mortgages as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Our investment process includes sourcing and screening of investment opportunities, assessing investment suitability, conducting interest rate and prepayment analysis, evaluating cash flow and collateral performance, and reviewing legal structure and servicer and originator information and investment structuring, as appropriate, to seek an attractive return commensurate with the risk we are bearing. Upon identification of an investment opportunity, the investment will be screened and monitored by us to determine its impact on maintaining our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. We will seek to make investments in sectors where we have strong core competencies and believe market risk and expected performance can be reasonably quantified. 

We evaluate each one of our investment opportunities based on its expected risk &#8209;adjusted return relative to the returns available from other, comparable investments. In addition, we evaluate new opportunities based on their relative expected returns compared to comparable positions held in our portfolio. The terms of any leverage available to us for use in funding an investment purchase are also taken into consideration, as are any risks posed by illiquidity or correlations with other securities in the portfolio. We also develop a macro outlook with respect to each target asset class by examining factors in the broader economy such as gross domestic product, interest rates, unemployment rates and availability of credit, among other things. We also analyze fundamental trends in the relevant target asset class sector to adjust/maintain our outlook for that particular target asset class. 

Our primary focus has been to build a portfolio of commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans with attractive risk &#8209;adjusted returns by focusing on the underlying real estate fundamentals and credit analysis of the borrowers. We continually monitor borrower performance and complete a detai led, loan &#8209; by &#8209;loan formal credit review on a quarterly basis. The results of this review are incorporated into our quarterly assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

The weighted average coupon for first mortgages, subordinated mortgages and mezzanine loans originated and acquired by the Lending Segment during the year ended December 31, 2015 was 4.4%, 8.3% and 10.5%, respectively . The following table summarizes the activity in the Lending Segment&#x2019;s loan portfolio and the associated changes in future funding commitments associated with these loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 (amounts in thousands):

Regulation 

Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; (5) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; and (6) regulate affordable housing rental activities. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans and the Fair Housing Act. We intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. 

Competition 

We are engaged in a competitive business. In our investment activities, we compete for opportunities with numerous public and private investment vehicles, including financial institutions, specialty finance companies, mortgage banks, pension funds, opportunity funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, REITs and other institutional investors, as well as individuals. Many competitors are significantly larger than we are, have well established operating histories and may have greater access to capital, more resources and other advantages over us. These competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments or to compromise underwriting standards and, as a result, our origination volume and profit margins could be adversely affected. 

Our Manager 

We are externally managed and advised by our Manager and benefit from the personnel, relationships and experience of our Manager&#x2019;s executive team and other personnel of Starwood Capital Group. Pursuant to the terms of a management agreement between our Manager and us, our Manager provides us with our management team and appropriate support personnel. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between our Manager and Starwood Capital Group Management, LLC, our Manager has access to the personnel and resources of Starwood Capital Group necessary for the implementation and execution of our business strategy. 

Our Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately &#8209;held private equity firm founded and controlled by Mr. Sternlicht. Starwood Capital Group has invested in most major classes of real estate, directly and indirectly, through operating companies, portfolios of properties and single assets, including multifamily, office, retail, hotel, residential entitled land and communities, senior housing, mixed &#8209;use and golf courses. Starwood Capital Group invests at different levels of the capital structure, including equity, preferred equity, mezzanine debt and senior debt, depending on the asset risk profile and return expectation. 

Our Manager draws upon the experience and expertise of Starwood Capital Group&#x2019;s team of professionals and support personnel operating in 12 cities across six countries. Our Manager also benefits from Starwood Capital Group&#x2019;s dedicated asset management group operating in offices located in the U.S. and abroad. We also benefit from Starwood Capital Group&#x2019;s portfolio management, finance and administration functions, which address legal, compliance, investor relations and operational matters, asset valuation, risk management and information technologies in connection with the performance of our Manager&#x2019;s duties. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has 450 full &#8209;time employees, the majority of which are real estate professionals located throughout the U.S. and Europe. 

Taxation of the Company 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, for federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. 

Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and property. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and will not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements under the Code. 

We utilize taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#x201C;TRSs&#x201D;) to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. Any income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C corporation based upon its net income. 

See Item 1A&#x2014;&#x201C;Risk Factors&#x2014;Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT&#x201D; for additional tax status information.

&#xB7; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; 

&#xB7; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be required to be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act; 

&#xB7; 

not more than 25% of our equity will be invested in any individual asset without the consent of a majority of our independent directors; and 

&#xB7; 

any investment of up to $50 million requires the approval of our Manager&#x2019;s Investment Committee; any investment in excess of $50 million also requires the approval of our Chief Executive Officer; any investment from $150 million to $250 million also requires the approval of the Investment Committee of our board of directors; and any investment in excess of $250 million also requires the approval of our board of directors. 

These investment guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. In addition, both our Manager and our board of directors must approve any change in our investment guidelines that would modify or expand the types of assets in which we invest.
