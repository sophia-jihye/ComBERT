 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

We are a diversified television broadcasting company with national reach with a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations and digital platforms. The content, distributed through our broadcast platform, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, and other original programming produced by us. We also distribute our original programming, and owned and operated network affiliates, on other third-party platforms. Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments. 

Broadcast 

As of December 31, 2015, our broadcast distribution platform is a single reportable segment for accounting purposes. It consists primarily of our broadcast television stations, which we own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements (LMAs), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs and SSAs) to 163 stations in 79 markets. These stations broadcast 444 channels, including 215 channels affiliated with primary networks or program service providers comprised of: FOX (47), ABC (32), CBS (29), NBC (23), CW (44), MyNetworkTV (MNT) (34), and Univision (6). The other 229 channels broadcast programming from Antenna TV, American Sports Network (ASN), Azteca, Bounce Network, COMET, Decades, Estrella TV, Get TV, Grit, Heartland, Me TV, MundoFox, Retro TV, Telemundo, This TV, News &#38; Weather, Zuus Country, and one channel broadcasts independent programming. For the purpose of this report, these channels are referred to as &#8220;our&#8221; stations. Refer to our Television Markets and Stations &#32;table later in this Item 1. for more information. 

Our broadcast segment provides free over-the-air programming to television viewing audiences in the communities we serve through our local television stations. The programming that we provide on our primary channels consists of network provided programs, locally-produced news, local sporting events, programming from program service arrangements, syndicated entertainment programs, and internally originated programming provided by our other media subsidiaries. We provide live local sporting events on many of our stations by acquiring the local television broadcast rights for these events. Additionally, we purchase and barter for popular syndicated programming from third party television producers. 

We are the nation's largest producer of local news. We produce approximately 2,200 hours of news per week at 106 stations in 77 markets, including one station which produces news pursuant to a local news sharing arrangement for a competitive station in that market. We have 20 stations which have local news sharing arrangements with a competitive station in that market that produces the news aired on our station. 

See Operating Strategy &#32;later in this Item 1. &#32;for more information regarding the news and programming we provide. 

&#160; 

Our primary source of revenue is the sale of commercial inventory on our television stations to our advertising customers. We also earn revenues by providing digital content to non-linear devices via websites, mobile, and social media advertisements as well as bundling digital advertisements with traditional commercial inventory on our television stations. Our objective is to meet the needs of our advertising customers by delivering significant audiences in key demographics. Our strategy is to achieve this objective by providing quality local news programming, popular network, syndicated and live sports programs, and other original content to our viewing audience. We attract most of our national television advertisers through national marketing representation firms which have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Our local television advertisers are attracted through the use of a local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 750 sales account executives and 110 local sales managers company-wide. 

We also earn revenue from our retransmission consent agreements through payments from multichannel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") in our markets. The MVPDs are local cable companies, satellite television and local telecommunication video providers. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs for access to our broadcast signal and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. 

Our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. Political spending has been significantly higher in the even-number years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. Because of the political election cyclicality, 

there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing even-numbered years&#8217; performance to the odd numbered years&#8217; performance. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed on a national level as well as those within the local communities we serve. We believe political advertising will continue to be a strong advertising category in our industry. With increased spending by Political Action Committees (PACs), including so-called Super PACs, and as political-activism around social, political, economic and environmental causes continues to draw attention, political advertising levels may increase further. 

Original Networks and Content 

We own and operate various networks carried on our distribution platforms: ASN, our regional sports network launched in 2014, and COMET, our science fiction multicast network which debuted in October 2015. Also, in January 2016, we announced the acquisition of Tennis Channel, a cable network which includes coverage of the top 100 tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows. We anticipate the acquisition of Tennis Channel to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. 

Our internally developed content includes Ring of Honor ("ROH"), our professional wrestling promotion, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkinsson ("Full Measure"), our national Sunday morning investigative and political analysis program, launched in October 2015, and our joint venture with Tornante Company which is currently developing low-cost syndicated court, game, comedy, and talk shows. 

Digital and Internet 

We also earn revenues from Sinclair Digital Solutions, a full service digital agency which uses our digital expertise to help businesses run multi-platform digital marketing campaigns, and navigate and compete in a world of constant innovation and changes in consumer behavior. During 2015, we launched Sinclair Digital Ventures which focuses on the investment in emerging digital technologies and digital content companies that support and expand Sinclair's digital capabilities and non-linear footprint. In April 2016, we will re-launch Circa, a national online digital news operation aimed at the younger demographic. 

Technical Services 

We own subsidiaries which are dedicated to providing broadcast related technical services to the broadcast industry including: Acrodyne Technical Services, a provider of service and support for broadcast transmitters throughout the world; Dielectric, a designer and manufacturer of broadcast systems including all components from transmitter output to antenna; and ONE Media, a technology innovator at the forefront of developing industry standards and related technologies for Next Generation Broadcast Platforms (Next Gen) encompassing its flexible and enhanced vision for broadcasting. 

Other Non-media Investments 

We own various non-media related investments through our subsidiary Keyser Capital which is an originator, underwriter, and manager of our investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, mezzanine financing, and real estate investments. Some of the largest investments include: Triangle Sign and Service (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Alarm Funding Associates (Alarm Funding), a regional security alarm operator and bulk acquisition company; Bay Creek South (Bay Creek), a land developer for a planned resort community in Cape Charles, VA; and Jefferson Place, a mixed use land development project in Frederick, MD. 

We are a Maryland corporation formed in 1986. Our principal offices are located at 10706 Beaver Dam Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030. Our telephone number is (410) 568-1500 and our website address is www.sbgi.net.

When we negotiate the terms of our network affiliations or program service arrangements, we negotiate on behalf of all of our stations affiliated with that entity simultaneously. This results in substantially similar terms for our stations, including the expiration date of the network affiliations or program service arrangements. If the affiliation agreement expires, we may continue to operate under the existing affiliation agreement on a temporary basis while we negotiate a new affiliation agreement.

Operating Strategy 

Programming to Attract Viewership . We seek to target our programming offerings to attract viewership, to meet the needs of the communities in which we serve and to meet the needs of our advertising customers. In pursuit of this strategy, we seek to develop original programming or obtain, at attractive prices, popular syndicated programming that is complementary to each station&#8217;s network programming. We also seek to broadcast live local and national sporting events that would appeal to a large segment of the local community. See Popular Sporting Events &#32;below for further discussion. Moreover, we produce local news at 106 stations in 77 markets, including one station which has a local news sharing agreement with a competitive station in that market. See Local News &#32;below for further discussion. 

Television advertising prices are primarily based on ratings information measured and distributed by Nielsen. Nielsen is currently not accredited by the Media Rating Council, an independent organization that monitors rating services, which revoked Nielsen&#8217;s accreditation in the 154 markets in which Nielsen measures ratings exclusively by its diary methodology. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 52 of our 79 markets are diary only markets. We entered into a contract with Rentrak Corporation, an alternative rating service provider that uses set-top box television measurements to provide us additional measurement information to the ratings services that Nielsen provides for all 163 of our stations in our 79 markets. 

&#160; 

Local News . We believe that the production and broadcasting of local news is an important link to the community and an aid to a station&#8217;s efforts to expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to advertising sources targeted specifically to local news viewers. Our news stations also produce content on digital platforms such as websites, applications, and social media. 

During 2015, we expanded news in 16 markets and plan to add additional newscasts in 7 markets in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , 29.6% of our net time sales were earned during the local news we produce each week. 

&#160; 

Our local news initiatives are an important part of our strategy that have resulted in our entering into 21 local news sharing arrangements with other television broadcasters. We are the provider of news services for 1 market, while in 20 of our news share arrangements we are the recipient of services. We believe that, in the markets where we have news share arrangements, such arrangements generally provide both higher viewer ratings and revenues for the station receiving the news and generate a profit for the news share provider. Generally, both parties and the local community are beneficiaries of these arrangements. 

&#160; 

In addition to our traditional local news stories, we have utilized our national reach and placement in the nation's capital to provide our local viewers with broader national news stories which are relevant to our local viewers. In January 2015, we launched a national news desk and a Capitol Hill bureau. These news teams produce daily unique stories unavailable from other sources and focused on government accountability storytelling that provides a significant point of difference for our stations. Available on-air and online, the bureau not only expands our news presence, but gives our local station viewers an opportunity to hear the views of their members of Congress through programs such as "Connect to Congress, " our weekly on-air and digital feature which provides an electronic video pathway for lawmakers to speak to their constituents. 

Popular Sporting Events . At some of our stations, we have been able to acquire local television broadcast rights for certain sporting events, including NBA basketball, MLB, NFL football, NHL hockey, ACC basketball and both Big Ten and SEC football and basketball and certain other college and high school sports. Our CW and MyNetworkTV stations generally face fewer preemption restrictions on broadcasting live local sporting events compared with our FOX, ABC, CBS and NBC stations, which are required to broadcast a greater number of hours of programming supplied by the networks. In addition, our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, CBS and NBC have network arrangements to broadcast certain NBA basketball games, MLB baseball games, NFL football games, NHL hockey games, NASCAR races and PGA golf events, as well as other popular sporting events. Our stations also broadcast programming provided by ASN. See Development of Original Networks and Content &#32;below for the discussion related to the operating strategy of ASN. 

Control of Operating and Programming Costs . By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and other costs, we have been able to achieve operating margins that we believe are very competitive within the television broadcast industry. We believe our national reach as of December 31, 2015 of over 37.4% of the country provides us with a strong position to negotiate with programming providers and, as a result, the opportunity to purchase high quality programming at more favorable prices. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our station&#8217;s programming and operating costs through program-specific profit analysis, detailed budgeting, regionalization of staff and detailed long-term planning models. We also control our programming cost by creating original high-quality programming that is distributed on our broadcast platform. This original programming includes our ASN and COMET networks, and ROH and Full Measure programs. 

Developing Local Franchises . We believe the greatest opportunity for a sustainable and growing customer base lies within our local communities. Therefore, we have focused on developing a strong local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 750 sales account executives and 110 local sales managers company-wide. Excluding political advertising revenue, retransmission revenues, and other local revenues, 71.5% and 71.9% of our same station net time sales were local for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Market share survey results reflect that our stations' share of the local television advertising market increased to 25.2% in 2015 from 23.8% in 2014. Our goal is to grow our local revenues by increasing our market share and by developing new business opportunities. 

Attract and Retain High Quality Management . We believe that much of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated managers at both the corporate and local station levels. We provide a combination of base salary, long-term incentive compensation including equity awards and, where appropriate, cash bonus pay designed to be competitive with comparable employers in the television broadcast industry. A significant portion of the compensation available to certain members of our senior management and our sales force is based on their achievement of certain performance goals. We also encourage station managers and employees to utilize our diverse station group to grow in their careers while remaining in the Sinclair family of stations via internal promotion and relocation. 

Multi-Channel Broadcasting. &#32;FCC rules allow broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides viewers with additional programming alternatives such as COMET, Grit, and Get TV, at no additional cost to them. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our multi-channel digital spectrum space with the goal towards achieving higher profits and community service. As of December 31, 2015, we have 281 multi-channels in our digital spectrum. 

Retransmission Consent Agreements . We have retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, such as cable, satellite and telecommunications operators in our markets. MVPDs compensate us for the right to retransmit our broadcast signals. Our successful negotiations with MVPDs have created agreements that now produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams. 

Improvement and maintenance of our distribution platforms . We continue to improve and maintain a strong distribution platform that consists of our traditional broadcast network and our digital platforms. Our Acrodyne and Dielectric subsidiaries are leaders in servicing and manufacturing broadcast infrastructure. As a result we maintain a strong infrastructure through which we provide high quality uninterrupted content on our broadcast stations. 

Developing New Business . We are always striving to develop new business models to complement or enhance our traditional television broadcast business. We have developed new ways to bundle online, mobile text messaging and social media advertising with our traditional commercial broadcasting model. Additionally, we continue to leverage our national reach to provide new high quality content to our local communities. 

We continue to expand our digital distribution platforms through initiatives such as our new video management system, which simplifies and automates our broadcast-to-digital streaming workflow and allows for dynamic replacement of broadcast ads with digital ads targeted to each individual viewer. By using a single ad-serving system across all of our web sites, mobile apps and other digital assets, we are able to streamline our sales workflow, optimize yield and deliver comprehensive sales opportunities across our digital footprint. Additionally, we are deploying over-the-top initiatives (OTT), such as the NewsOn app, as well as our own content applications. 

Strategic Realignment of Station Portfolio . We routinely review and conduct investigations of potential television station acquisitions, dispositions and station swaps. At any given time, we may be in discussions with one or more television station owners. 

Development of Original Networks and Content. We seek to expand our sports broadcasting in DMAs as profitable opportunities arise. During 2014, we launched ASN on a number of our MyNet, CW and multi-cast channels. ASN became a 24/7 sports network in January 2016 and is currently carried in 15 markets which we plan to expand as we build a regional strategy with a national reach. ASN has entered into multi-year comprehensive sports rights agreements with a number of distinguished NCAA Division I conferences including Conference USA, the Colonial Athletic Association, Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference, Ivy League, and American Athletic Conference . In addition to its college initiative, ASN produces local high school sports under the &#8220;Thursday Night Lights&#8221; and &#8220;Friday Night Rivals&#8221; brands. Also in 2016, ASN entered into a 2-year agreement to broadcast the regular and post season games of Major League Football, a new professional spring-football league scheduled to kick off in 2016. 

Likewise, in October 2015, we led the market in launching the first-ever science fiction multicast network, COMET, featuring over 1,500 hours of premium MGM content and already reaching approximately 70 million households with more coverage expected. 

We entered into a joint venture with Tornante Company to develop low-cost syndicated court, game, comedy and talk shows. These are shows that have predictable audiences and genres that do well on our television stations. 

In early 2016, we announced the acquisition of Tennis Channel. Unlike fully distributed cable networks that are in a declining business, Tennis Channel, with its live tournaments and matches, passionate fan base and established brand, is vastly under-distributed. With the support of Sinclair and our relationships with the multi-video program distributors (MVPDs), we have been successful in negotiating significant increases in carriage with MVPDs, with more penetration expected. Among the many benefits of the expanded carriage and pairing their content with our broadcast promotional capabilities, are additional MVPD subscriber fees, viewers, and advertising revenues. 

Expansion of digital and internet. We announced the re-launch of Circa, a national online digital news operation aimed at the Millennial demographic. The site will focus on issues trending from around the country, delivered in an independent-minded style, with a heavy focus on short and long form video, optimized for mobile and social media engagement. In addition to its unique stories, news talent and creativity, Circa will have the added benefit of capitalizing on our broadcast branding and promotional platform to drive viewing impressions, an opportunity not available to other online news providers. Circa is expected to launch in April 2016. 

We have leveraged our digital expertise by launching Sinclair Digital Solutions through which we run effective, integrated, and multi-platform digital marketing programs that drive loyalty, engage consumers and help businesses achieve their goals. 

&#32;These innovative products and extension of our core broadcast business allow us to compete for Internet, network, and print impressions and revenues. We continue to seek additional opportunities to invest in emerging digital technologies and digital content companies that support and expand Sinclair's digital capabilities and non-linear footprint. 

Development of Next Generation Broadcast Platforms (Next Gen). ONE Media has developed, successfully demonstrated, and received approval for inclusion in the ATSC 3.0 transmission standard, the critical signaling and framing technology that is core to building Next Gen. Advanced Television Systems Committee standard 3.0 (ATSC 3.0) is an enhancement to the current broadcast standard and provides for increased data bits that are mobile, universal and Internet Protocol (IP) based. Next Gen provides a common IP pipe for broadband and broadcast convergence and compelling hybrid functionality; a way to make the broadcast platform an integral piece in the much broader wireless ecosystem. In addition, it opens opportunities to deliver enhanced core television services such as higher quality 4K &#8220;Ultra High Definition&#8221; video and immersive &#8220;3D Audio&#8221; sound, as well as the entire range of targeted advertising, personalized content delivery, and data collection and measurement. Additionally, Next Gen will allow us to deploy multiple new business opportunities. This could include partnerships with video and audio programming and other datacasting services, content delivery networks seeking to expand &#8220;edge&#8221; services, and other users seeking alternatives for regional and national content distribution. 

Other Non-media Investments. &#160; We have sought ways to diversify our business and return additional value to our shareholders through investments in non-media based businesses and real estate. We carry investments in various companies from different industries including sign design and fabrication and security alarm monitoring and bulk acquisition. In addition, we invest in various real estate ventures including developmental land, operating commercial and multi-family residential real estate properties and apartments. We also invest in private equity and structured debt / mezzanine financing investment funds. Currently, operating results from our investments represent a small portion of our overall operating results. 

&#160; 

FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION BROADCASTING 

The ownership, operation and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under the authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules and regulations or the Communications Act. 

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations. 

License Grant and Renewal 

Television stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. During certain periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. 

&#160; Although historically renewal of a license, including those of the Company, is granted in the vast majority of cases, even when petitions to deny are filed, there can be no assurance that the license of any station will be renewed or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum term permitted. 

Certain of our stations have pending renewal applications that are subject to petitions to deny or informal objections. The FCC is in the process of considering these renewal applications and we believe the petitions and objections have no merit. 

In addition, action on many license renewal applications, including those we have filed, has been delayed because of the pendency of complaints that programming aired by the various networks contained indecent material and complaints regarding alleged violations of sponsorship identification rules. We cannot predict when the FCC will address these complaints and act on the renewal applications. We continue to have operating authority until final action is taken on our renewal applications. 

Ownership Matters 

General . The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the &#8220;character&#8221; of the licensee and those persons holding &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests in that licensee and compliance with the Communications Act&#8217;s limitations on foreign ownership. The FCC has indicated that in order to approve an assignment or transfer of a broadcast license the FCC must make an affirmative determination that the proposed transaction serves the public interest, not merely that the transaction does not violate its rules or shares factual elements with other transactions previously approved by the FCC, and that it may deny a transaction if it determines that the transaction could result in public interest harms by substantially frustrating or impairing the objectives or implementation of the Communications Act or related statutes. 

The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association. In the case of corporations holding, or through subsidiaries controlling, broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation&#8217;s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies and bank trust departments that are passive investors) are generally attributable. In addition, pursuant to what is known as the equity-debt-plus rule, a major programming supplier or same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station&#8217;s total debt plus equity. Further, the Communications Act generally prohibits foreign parties from having more than a 20% interest (voting or equity) in a broadcast licensee or more than a 35% interest in the parent of that licensee. Recently, the FCC has indicated that it would consider indirect foreign ownership of broadcast licenses in excess of the 25% level on a case-by-case basis. In October, 2015, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on among other things, proposals to (i) simplify the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast licensees, (ii) adopt a standardized filing and review process for requests to exceed the 25% benchmark and (iii) modify the methodology a licensee may use to determine compliance with the 25% benchmark. That rulemaking remains pending. 

Sinclair and its subsidiaries are domestic corporations, and the members of the Smith family (who together hold approximately 76.5% as of February 19, 2015 of the common voting rights of Sinclair) are all United States citizens. Our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (the Amended Certificate) contain limitations on alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in the Communications Act. Pursuant to the Amended Certificate, we have the right to repurchase alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, to comply with the alien ownership restrictions. 

Additional ownership rules as currently in effect are as follows: 

Radio / Television Cross-Ownership Rule . The FCC&#8217;s radio / television cross-ownership rule generally permits a party to own a combination of up to two television stations and six radio stations in the same market, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market. 

Newspaper / Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule . The FCC&#8217;s rule generally prohibits the common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market. We do not currently own any daily newspapers, nor do we have current plans to acquire one. 

National Ownership Rule . By statute, the national television viewing audience reach cap is 39%. Under this rule, where an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more than one television station in a market, the percentage of the national television viewing audience encompassed within that market is only counted once. Additionally, since historically, VHF stations (channels 2 through 13) shared a larger portion of the market than UHF stations (channels 14 through 51), only half of the households in the market area of any UHF station are included when calculating an entity&#8217;s national television viewing audience (commonly referred to as the UHF discount). On September 26, 2013, the FCC initiated a rulemaking seeking comment on whether (a) the FCC has the authority to modify the national ownership rule, including revision or elimination of the UHF discount; (b) the UHF discount should be eliminated; (c) if the UHF discount is eliminated, grandfathering should be accorded where owners of television groups would exceed the 39% national audience cap by virtue of the elimination of the discount; and (d) a discount for VHF station ownership should be adopted. We cannot predict the outcome of that rulemaking. While this rulemaking is pending, the FCC may not allow us to acquire additional television stations that would put us over the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount. 

All but twenty-eight of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services, are UHF. We reach over 37.4% of U. S. television households or 23.2% taking into account the FCC&#8217;s UHF discount. 

Local Television (Duopoly) Rule . A party may own television stations in adjoining markets, even if there is Grade B overlap between the two stations&#8217; broadcast signals and generally may own two stations in the same market only (i) if there is no Grade B overlap between the stations; or (ii) if the market containing both the stations will contain at least eight independently owned full-power television stations post-merger (the eight voices test) and not more than one station is among the top-four rated stations in the market. 

Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements 

Certain of our stations have entered into agreements with other stations in the same market, through which we provide programming and operating services pursuant to time brokerage or local marketing agreements (LMAs) or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs and SSAs). LMAs and JSAs are attributable where a licensee holds an attributable interest in a television station and (i) programs more than 15% of another television station or (ii) sells more than 15% of the advertising on another station in the same market. 

LMAs existing prior to November 5, 1996 are currently grandfathered until further FCC action. In its Order approving the Allbritton transaction, the FCC expressed concerns that it believed Sinclair&#8217;s LMA in Charleston was not subject to grandfathering protection. Sinclair disagreed with the FCC&#8217;s interpretation but cannot predict what steps, if any, the FCC will take in the future with respect to that LMA, which has been terminated with respect to the Charleston market, but continues in effect with respect to other stations. JSAs existing as of March 31, 2014 are grandfathered until October 1, 2025. We cannot predict whether we will be able to terminate or restructure such JSAs prior to October 1, 2025, on terms that are as advantageous to us as the current arrangements. If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs or JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. For more information on the risks, see Changes in rules on local marketing agreements &#32;within The FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets &#32;within Risk Factors &#32;and Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership &#32;within Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies &#32;for further discussion. 

In March, 2014, the FCC issued a public notice on the processing of broadcast television applications proposing sharing arrangements and contingent interests. The public notice indicated that the FCC will closely scrutinize any broadcast assignment or transfer application that proposes that two or more stations in the same market will enter into an agreement to share facilities, employees and/or services or to jointly acquire programming or sell advertising including through a JSA, LMA or similar agreement and enter into an option, right of first refusal, put /call arrangement or other similar contingent interest, or a loan guarantee. We cannot now predict what actions the FCC may require in connection with the processing of applications for FCC consent to future transactions. 

Antitrust Regulation . DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission have increased their scrutiny of the television industry and have reviewed matters related to the concentration of ownership within markets (including LMAs and outsourcing agreements) even when ownership or the LMA or other outsourcing agreement in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations. The DOJ takes the position that an LMA or other outsourcing agreement entered into in anticipation of a station&#8217;s acquisition with the proposed buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, cannot be implemented until the waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated. 

Satellite Carriage 

The Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA), as extended by The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA) and the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization (STELAR) among other things, (i) allows satellite carriers to provide local television signals by satellite within a station market, and to carry all local signals in any market where they carry any local signals, (ii) requires all television stations to elect to exercise certain &#8220;must-carry&#8221; or &#8220;retransmission consent&#8221; rights in connection with their carriage by satellite carriers, and (iii) authorizes satellite delivery of distant network signals, significantly viewed signals and local low-power television station signals into local markets under defined circumstances. 

Must-Carry / Retransmission Consent 

Television broadcasters are required to make triennial elections to exercise either certain &#8220;must-carry&#8221; or &#8220;retransmission consent&#8221; rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems in each broadcaster&#8217;s local market. By electing to exercise must-carry rights, a broadcaster demands carriage and receives a specific channel on cable systems within its DMA. Must carry rights are not absolute and are dependent on a number of factors which may or may not be present in a particular case. Alternatively, if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights, it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal or grant the appropriate cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a fee or other consideration. We have elected to exercise our retransmission consent rights with respect to all our stations. Effective June 18, 2014, the FCC changed its rules implementing the statutory duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. With this change, a television broadcast station is prohibited from negotiating retransmission consent jointly with another television station in the same market if the stations are not under common &#8220;de jure&#8221; control as such term is defined by the FCC. Under the rule changes, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market; neither may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information. The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, the new rules may have on future negotiations for retransmission consent agreements. 

Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the &#8220;totality of the circumstances test&#8221; for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking seeks comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a &#8220;marquee sports or entertainment event,&#8221; restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters&#8217; ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters&#8217; ability to invoke the FCC&#8217;s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. We cannot predict the impact such rulemaking may have on our retransmission consent negotiations. 

Network Non-Duplication / Syndicated Exclusivity / Territorial Exclusivity 

The FCC&#8217;s syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on &#8220;distant signals&#8221; (i.e. signals of broadcast stations, including so-called &#8220;superstations,&#8221; which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems&#8217; local community). The FCC&#8217;s network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast, network affiliated stations to require that cable operators black out duplicate network programming carried on distant signals. Both rules are subject to various exceptions and limitations. In a number of markets in 

which we own or program stations affiliated with a network, a station that is affiliated with the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in our markets. Such significantly viewed signals are not subject to black out pursuant to FCC&#8217;s network non-duplication rules. The carriage of two network stations on the same cable system could result in a decline of viewership, adversely affecting the revenues of our owned or programmed stations. In March, 2014, the FCC issued a Report And Order And Further Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking. 

Digital Television 

FCC rules provide that television broadcast licensees may use their digital television (DTV) channels for a wide variety of services such as HD television, multiple standard definition television programming, audio, data and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard and further subject to the requirement that broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues from any DTV ancillary or supplementary service for which there is a subscription fee or for which the licensee receives a fee from a third party. 

Programming and Operations 

&#160; The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station&#8217;s community of license. FCC licensees continue to be required, however, to present programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their communities and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from viewers concerning a station&#8217;s programming may be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, obscene and indecent broadcasts and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In addition, television licensees have obligations to create and follow employment outreach programs, provide a minimum amount of programming for children, comply with rules relating to the emergency alert system (EAS), maintain an online public inspection file and abide by regulations specifying requirements to provide closed captions for its programming. FCC licensees are, in general, responsible for the content of their broadcast programming, including that supplied by television networks. Accordingly, there is a risk of being fined as a result of our broadcast programming, including network programming. 

Pending Matters 

Congress and the FCC have under consideration and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations and affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. 

Other matters that could affect our broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry, such as direct television broadcast satellite service, Class A television service, the continued establishment of wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television technologies, the internet and mobility and portability of our broadcast signal to hand-held devices. 

Congress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called &#8220;incentive auctions&#8221; to auction and repurpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. Pursuant to the &#8220;reverse&#8221; auction, a television broadcaster can submit bids to receive compensation for relinquishing all or a portion of its rights in the television spectrum of their full-service and Class A stations. A broadcaster has the option to bid to relinquish its channel entirely, relocate to a different band (UHF to VHF) or relinquish its channel and enter into a channel sharing agreement to channel share with another broadcaster. After completion of the reverse auction, the FCC will conduct a &#8220;forward auction&#8221; of the newly freed spectrum to be sold for wireless broadband use. The FCC must complete both auctions by 2022. 

Even though participation in the incentive auction is voluntary, a non-participating broadcaster may still be required to relocate its station to another channel or make technical changes to facilitate repacking the band. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.75 billion fund to compensate broadcasters and cable systems for the reasonable costs of repacking. We do not know if such fund will be sufficient to fully compensate broadcasters for such repacking. Applications to participate in the reverse auction were due on January 12, 2016 and applications to participate in the forward auction were due on February 10, 2016. The reverse auction is currently scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. 

In March 2014, the FCC issued a further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Report and Order which proposes, among other things, (i) eliminating the newspaper/radio cross ownership rule and the radio/television cross ownership rule, (ii) retaining the newspaper/television cross ownership rule but allowing for waivers on a case by case basis, (iii) retaining the local television rules, and (iv) prohibiting two television stations in the same market from swapping network affiliations if it would result in a single owner having two top-four network affiliations in a market where it could not otherwise own both affiliation-swapping stations. The proposed rulemaking also seeks comment on how to define a television shared services agreement and whether television stations should be required to disclose shared services agreements and how best to achieve disclosure. 

We further cannot predict the outcome of the incentive auction or its effect upon our ability to compete. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the FCC or the Congress might adopt even more stringent requirements or incentives to abandon current spectrum if the incentive auction does not have the desired result of freeing what the agency deems to be sufficient spectrum for wireless broadband use 

Other Considerations 

The preceding summary is not a complete discussion of all provisions of the Communications Act or other congressional acts or of the regulations and policies of the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ. For further information, reference should be made to the Communications Act other congressional acts and regulations and public notices circulated from time to time by the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ. There are additional regulations and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies that govern political broadcasts, advertising, equal employment opportunity and other matters affecting our business and operations. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 

&#160; 

Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored or disposed of at certain of those facilities. In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored or disposed of hazardous substances. As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation, that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us. We presently believe that none of our properties have any condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Our television stations compete for audience share and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective DMAs, as well as with other advertising media such as MVPDs, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, telecommunications providers, internet and other digital media, and direct mail. Some competitors are part of larger organizations with substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have. Other factors that are material to a television station&#8217;s competitive position include signal coverage, local program acceptance, network affiliation or program service, audience characteristics and assigned broadcast frequency. 

&#160; 

Competition in the television broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual DMAs. Generally, a television broadcasting station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs. Our television stations are located in highly competitive DMAs. MVPDs can increase competition for a broadcast television station by bringing into its market additional cable network channels. These narrow cable network channels are typically low rated, and, as a result, advertisements are inexpensive to the local advertisers. In addition, certain of our DMAs are overlapped by over-the-air station from adjacent DMAs and MVPDs of stations from other DMAs, which tends to spread viewership and advertising expenditures over a larger number of television stations. 

&#160; 

Television stations compete for audience share primarily on the basis of program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates. Our network affiliated stations are largely dependent upon the performance of network provided programs in order to attract viewers. Non-network time periods are programmed by the station primarily with syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter or barter-only, as well as through self-produced news, public affairs programs, live local sporting events, paid-programming and other entertainment programming. 

&#160; 

Television advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size of the DMA in which the station operates, a program&#8217;s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract, the number of advertisers competing for the available time, the demographic makeup of the DMA served by the station, the availability of alternative advertising media in the DMA, the aggressiveness and knowledge of the sales forces in the DMA and development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming. We believe that our sales and programming strategies allow us to compete effectively for advertising revenues within our DMAs. 

&#160; 

The television broadcasting industry is continuously faced with technical changes and innovations, competing entertainment and communications media, changes in labor conditions and governmental restrictions or actions of federal regulatory bodies, including the FCC, any of which could possibly have a material effect on a television station&#8217;s operations and profits. 

&#160; 

Moreover, technology advances and regulatory changes affecting programming delivery through fiber optic lines, video compression, and new wireless uses could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the further development of increasingly specialized &#8220;niche&#8221; programming. Telephone companies are permitted to provide video distribution services, on a common carrier basis, as &#8220;cable systems&#8221; or as &#8220;open video systems,&#8221; each pursuant to different regulatory schemes. 

&#160; 

DTV technology allows us to provide viewers multiple channels of digital television over each of our existing standard digital channels, to provide certain programming in HD television format and to deliver other channels of information in the forms of data and programming to the internet, PCs, smart phones, tablet computers and mobile devices. These additional capabilities may provide us with additional sources of revenue, as well as additional competition. 

&#160; 

We also compete for programming, which involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Our stations compete for access to those programs against in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated products and with national cable networks. Public broadcasting stations generally compete with commercial broadcasters for viewers, but not for advertising dollars. 

&#160; 

We believe we compete favorably against other television stations because of our management skill and experience, our ability historically to generate revenue share greater than our audience share, our network affiliations and program service arrangements and our local program acceptance. In addition, we believe that we benefit from the operation of multiple broadcast properties, affording us certain non-quantifiable economies of scale and competitive advantages in the purchase of programming. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 8,000 employees. Approximately 850 employees are represented by labor unions under certain collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any significant labor problems and consider our overall labor relations to be good.
