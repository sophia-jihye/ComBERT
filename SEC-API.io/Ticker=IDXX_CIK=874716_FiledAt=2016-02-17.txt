DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT 

&#160; 

We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;); water quality products (&#8220;Water&#8221;); and diagnostic products and services for livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food, which we refer to as Livestock , Poultry and Dairy (&#8220;LPD&#8221;) . Our Other operating segment combines and presents products for the human point-of-care medical diag nostics market (&#8220;OPTI Medical&#8221;) with our pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. &#160; 

&#160; 

The performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 39% of our overall revenue. These foreign sales accounted for approximately 33%, 50% and 89% of revenue in our CAG, Water and LPD segments, respectively. See &#8220;Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in this Annual Report on F orm 10-K for more information about our segments and revenue from customers outside of the U.S. 

&#160; 

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP 

&#160; 

CAG provides to veterinarians diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and well-being of pets . The breadth and complementary nature of our products and services comprise a unique competitive advantage that we refer to as the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage, providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care. The IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage improves staff efficiencies and also enables the veterinarian to communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner, which ultimately leads to growing practice revenues. 

&#160; 

CAG Diagnostics 

&#160; 

We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians&#8217; diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Integrated Diagnostic Information Management 

&#160; 

VetConnect PLUS is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients&#8217; data from all of IDEXX&#8217;s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight and enhanced decision making . In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or browser-based access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners and other veterinarians. In this way, VetConnect PLUS can aid veterinarian s and practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient&#8217;s care, which can support greater compliance with medical recommendations or preventive care protocols. VetConnect PLUS is currently available in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel and i n numerous countrie s throughout Europe. 

&#160; 

In-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions 

&#160; 

Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, urinalysis and coagulation analyzers, associated proprietary consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of single-use, handheld IDEXX SNAP &#160; rapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. 

&#160; 

The IDEXX VetLab suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are described below. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments. 

&#160; 

Blood and Urine Chemistry . We sell three chemistry analyzers, the Catalyst Dx &#160; Chemistry Analyzer, the Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions. These three instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (&#8220;Ortho&#8221;) based on Ortho&#8217;s dry slide technology. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and the Catalyst One analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems, Inc. (&#8220;OPTI Medical Systems&#8221;), one of our wholly- owned subsidiaries, and other slides also manufactured by IDEXX. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers in clude glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), albumin, calcium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total protein and many others . Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. All three analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of renal disease. &#160; 

&#160; 

The Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and test menu relative to the VetTest analyzer (our original chemistry analyzer), including the ability to run electrolytes, phenobarbital, fructosamine and total thyroxine (&#8220; T 4 &#8221;). Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged, multi-slide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system. These analyzers also enable automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum a nd urine. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers run a test to measure phenobarbital levels in blood, allowing veterin arians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently . Our fructosamine test helps veterinarians to diagnose and manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus, helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages. We launched our total T 4 test globally for use on the Catalyst One analyzer during the first quarter of 2015 and for use on the Catalyst Dx analyzer early in the third quarter of 2015. T 4 testing is essential to assessing and managing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Catalyst One analyzer, launched in November 2014, is engineered to deliver the same laboratory-quality results and real-time work flow as the Catalyst Dx analyzer, offering an attractive in-house chemistry option when a single sample drawer is sufficient for a clinic&#8217;s work-flow requirements. The Catalyst One analyzer currently offers an expanding menu of 30 tests, including tests for thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes and therapeutic drug monitoring. 

&#160; 

We also have two other chemistry analyzers, the VetLyte Electrolyte Analyzer and the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer. The VetStat analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that are manufactured by our OPTI Medical Systems business . 

&#160; 

Sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab equipment. 

&#160; 

Hematology . We sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte Dx &#160; Hematology Analyzer, the first and only in-house analyzer to combine laser-flow cytometry, optical fluorescence and laminar-flow impedance in its analysis; the original LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer and next generation LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, launched in 2013, which both use laser-flow cytometry technology in their analysis; and the IDEXX VetAutoread Hematology Analyzer, our original hematology analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dx &#160; Hematology Analyzer, the LaserCyte Dx He matology Analyzer and the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids. We also sell the Coag Dx Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders . 

&#160; 

The ProCyte Dx &#160; analyzer, our premier hematology analyzer, provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the LaserCyte, LaserCyte Dx and VetAutoread hematology analyzers. The ProCyte Dx an alyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters, including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells, for a more complete picture of a patient&#8217;s health. The ProCyte Dx is validated for ten companion animal species (canine, feline, equine, bovine, ferret, rabbit, gerbil, pig, guinea pig and mini pig) with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species. 

&#160; 

Immunoassay Testing Instruments . During the first quarter of 2014, we launched the SNAP Pro Mobile D evice , whic h automatically activates a SNAP test, properly times the run and captures an image of the result. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the SNAP Pro Mobile screen, or via VetConnect PLUS . In addition, the SNAP Pro Mobile D evice improves staff efficiency and ensures that all SNAP test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing. 

&#160; 

With multiple-patient testing functionality, the SNAPshot Dx Analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total T 4 , cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function, respectively. The SNAPshot Dx A nalyzer also reads, interprets and records the results of many IDEXX rapid assay SNAP tests, including our canine SNAP &#160; 4Dx Plus test, &#160; feline SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test, canine SNAP &#160; cPL test, feline SNAP &#160; fPL test, SNAP Feline Triple test and canine SNAP &#160; Heartworm RT test. 

&#160; 

Urinalysis . Early in 2016, we plan to launch SediVue Dx in North America. SediVue Dx is the first and only in-clinic urine sediment analyzer, designed to provide automated real-time results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis. SediVue Dx brings automation, speed and consistency to urinalysis, a traditionally laborious and variable process. Its leading-edge technology allows veterinary staff to perform a complete urinalysis in approximately 3 minutes. SediVue Dx uses proprietary image processing algorithms similar to facial recognition technology to identify clinically relevant particles found in urine and to capture high-contrast digital images that become part of the permanent patient record. The I DEXX VetLab UA Analyzer provides rapid, automated capture of semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use. 

&#160; 

&#160;

IDEXX VetLab Station . The IDEXX VetLab Station (&#8220;IVLS&#8221;) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capabili ty. IVLS securely connects to the i nternet, and in this way enables IDEXX to perform, through its SmartService Solutions wireless services , remote instrument service and software updates to IVLS and certain connected instruments. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS . We sell IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst Dx, Catalyst One, L aserCyte Dx and ProCyte Dx &#160; analyzers , SNAP Pro Mobile Device and also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow, connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the IDEXX VetLab suite, stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP test results, and sends and receives information from practice management systems, including the IDEXX Cornerstone system, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems. &#160; 

&#160; 

The SNAP rapid a ssays are single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instru mentation, although many kits may also be read and recorded au tomatically by the SNAPshot Dx A nalyzer or activated and captured automa tically by the SNAP Pro Mobile D evice as discu ssed above. The principal SNAP rapid a ssay tests are as follows: &#160; 

&#160; 

Single-Use Canine Tests : 

&#183; 

S NAP 4Dx Plus, which tests for the six vector -borne diseases ; Lyme disease, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys, and canine heartworm; 

&#183; 

SNAP Heart worm RT, which tests for hear tworm; 

&#183; 

SNAP Parvo, which tests for parvovirus, a virus causing life-threatening damage to the immune system and intestinal tract; 

&#183; 

SNAP cPL, which te sts for canine pancreatitis; 

&#183; 

SNAP Giardia , which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens, a commo n cause of waterborne infection; and 

&#183; 

SNAP Lepto, which tests for leptospirosis, a life-threatening bacterial infection spread through contact with water or soil that has been contaminated by the urine of infected animals. 

Sales of canine vector-borne disease tests, including SNAP 4Dx Plus &#160; and SNAP Heartworm RT, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice. 

&#160; 

Single-Use Feline Tests : 

&#183; 

SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (&#8220;FIV&#8221;) (which is similar to the virus that leads to AIDS in humans ), feline leukemia virus (&#8220;FeLV&#8221;) and feline heartworm; 

&#183; 

SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV; 

&#183; 

SNAP fPL, which tests for feline pancreatitis; 

&#183; 

SNAP Giardia , which is a fecal test for soluble Giardia antigens; and 

&#183; 

SNAP Feline proBNP, which uses a cardiac biomarker (NT proBNP) to test for stretch and stress on the heart. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Outside Reference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services 

&#160; 

We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and South Korea. We have large reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee and Leipzig, Germany that are strategically located near large logistics hubs of major air cargo carriers . Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant diseases and conditions in dogs and cats, including parasites, heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes and infectious diseases. &#160; Canine vector-borne disease testing volumes are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice. &#160; 

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2015, we launched IDEXX SDMA in North America, a new kidney test which detects the onset of canine and feline kidney disease months or years earlier than traditional methods. Upon its introduction, IDEXX SDMA was &#160; included in every chemistry panel submitted by our customers at no incremental charge. As of the first quarter of 2016, we have also launched IDEXX SDMA in all of major European countries and Australia. A full international launch of IDEXX SDMA is planned over the remainder of 2016. 

&#160; 

In the second quarter of 2015, we launched Hookworm and Roundworm antigen tests &#160; to all fecal panels that already include the Whipworm antigen test. These new intestinal parasite panels detect the presence of intestinal worms left undiagnosed by current methods, finding them earlier in the infection cycle and therefore enabling earlier disease diagnosis and treatment intervention. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmi tted by telephone and over the i nternet. 

&#160; 

As part of a previous business combination , we acquired the research and diag nostic laboratory (&#8220;RADIL&#8221;) business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri. RADIL provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers in North America, Europe and Asia. 

&#160; 

Customer In formation Management and Diagnostic Imaging Systems 

&#160; 

Customer Information Management . We develop, market and sell practice management systems, including hardware, software and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including for boarding and grooming), client communication, billing and inventory management. Our principal practice management systems are Cornerstone, DVMAX, Animana and Neo, which we launched in North America during the third quarter of 2015. IDEXX Neo and IDEXX Animana are cloud-based practice management systems available in North America, Europe and Australia, respectively. We also support several other practice management systems installed with our customers, including Better Choice, VPM, VetLINK and BeeFree. Our practice management services include Payment Solutions, Data Backup &#38; Recovery, Cornerstone Coach, Practice Profile and PetDetect boarding collars. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, we offer client communication and preventive care plan management services designed to strengthen the relationship between the veterinarian and the pet owner. We commercially launched Pet Health Network Pro in March 2013, which is a subscription-based service that permits veterinarians to provide online communication and education to pet owners before, during and after each patient visit, thus strengthening the loyalty between a practice and its clients. Further, veterinarians can share VetConnect PLUS testing results directly with pet owners via Pet Health Network Pro. We also offer Pet Health Network 3D, an educational subscription-based service that replaces cumbersome plastic anatomy models with engaging, three-dimension anatomical animations on a desktop or mobile device. Using this service in the exam room improves client communication and facilitates adherence to veterinarian recommendations. In September 2014, we acquired Petly Plans, a cloud-based software solution for veterinary practices to customize, manage and monitor a range of monthly payment preventive care plans for their pet owner clients. Petly Plans complements the Pet Health Network suite of client marketing services by making it easier for practices to increase access to the best care and offer plans that spread the cost of that care, including examinations, vaccines and diagnostics, over the course of the year. Certain of our services are compatible with non-IDEXX practice management systems. 

&#160; 

Di agnostic Imaging Systems . Our di agnostic imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell three di agnostic imaging systems, our IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging System, and the IDEXX I-Vision CR and the IDEXX I-Vision DR systems for small animal veterinary applications. The IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging System is a wireless system which uses advanced plate technology to capture clear, high-quality images in a short capture time. The IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging system is a portable unit promoted for use in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices. 

&#160; 

Our diagnostic imaging systems employ picture archiving and communication system (&#8220;PACS&#8221;) sof tware, IDEXX-PACS, that allows for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. This software also permits images from our di agnostic imaging systems to be integrated into patients&#8217; medical records in the Cornerstone system, as well as transferred to other practice management systems. 

&#160; 

During the third quarter of 2015, we launched IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud-based software solution for accessing, storing and sharing diagnostic images. IDEXX Web PACS is a software-as-a-service ( &#8220; SaaS &#8221; ) offering, which is integrated with IDEXX VetConnect &#160; PLUS to provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging results alongside patient diagnostic results from any internet connected device. IDEXX Web PACS updates automatically and offers secure storage for an unlimited number of diagnostic images. The new software features advanced radiology measurement tools as well as an interactive collaboration feature that allows veterinarians to collaborate and consult remotely with other practitioners. 

&#160; 

IDEXX I-Vision Mobile is a software application that allows veterinarians with the I-Vision DR and IDEXX I-Vision CR system s, as well as our legacy diagnostic &#160; imaging systems, to request, view and send images using an iPad &#174; or an Android &#8482; mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS software. &#160; 

&#160; 

WATER 

&#160; 

We provide innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid and accurate &#160; detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water, helping to ensure water safety for billions of people around the world. 

&#160; 

Our principal products are the Coli lert, Colilert-18 and Colisure tests, which simultaneously detect the presence of total coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. These products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater and water from private wells. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pool, spa and bottled water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that can cause &#8220;hot-tub rash,&#8221; &#8220;swimmer&#8217;s ear&#8221; and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems . Our Filta-Max and Filta-Max &#160; xpress products are used in the detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. that complement our Cryptosporidium and Giardi a t esting products. 

&#160; 

Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert or Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. In the second quarter of 2015, we launched the Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS, a next generation instrument of the previously available Quanti-Tray Sealer 2X. These instruments are used with the Quanti-Tray products for the determination of bacterial density in water samples. Our SimPlate for HPC product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample. 

&#160; 

We also sell consumables, parts and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products. 

&#160; 

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY and dairy 

&#160; 

We sell diagnostic tests , services and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic p roducts are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to livestock veterinarians, producers and processors. Our livestock testing services are offered to livestock veterinarians and producers. Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (&#8220;BVDV&#8221;) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (&#8220;PRRS&#8221;). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the ani mal susceptible to a host of other infections, impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine , leading to increased piglet mortality, reduced growth and vulnerability to secondary infections. We also provide tests for detecting pregnancy in bovine, which provides a means to optimize reproductive efficiency. 

&#160; 

Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test format and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product lines are SNAP Beta-Lactam ST and SNAPduo Beta-Tetra ST, which detect certain beta lactam and tetracycline antibiotic residues. We also sell SNAP &#160; tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as Aflatoxin M1. &#160; 

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2013, we acquired a Brazilian distributor of certain of our Livestock and Dairy products. As part of this acquisition, we acquired the right to distribute food safety products that monitor microbial contamination and drug residues for livestock producers, meat exporters and pharmaceutical companies. 

&#160; 

OTHER 

&#160; 

OPTI Medical Systems 

&#160; 

Through OPTI &#160; Medical Systems, we sell point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These OPTI analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. Our latest generation OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer, which launched in April 2013, contains many new features relative to previous generation blood gas analyzers including customized work flows, faster time to result, improved communication and a multi-level electronic control. Similar to our earlier generation OPTI CCA and OPTI Touch Electrolyte Analyzers, the OPTI CCA-TS2 runs whole blood, plasma and serum samples on single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. The OPTI LION Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, OPTI Medical Systems manufactures our VetStat analyzer, an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX VetLab suite for the veterinary market, and provides the dry slides for electrolyte testing on the Catalyst analyzers for our CAG segment . 

&#160; 

Other Activities 

&#160; 

Previously, we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical division and realigned two of our pharmaceutical product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of CAG, and realigned the remainder of the products, comprised of one product line and two out-licensing arrangements, to the Other segment. We retained certain drug delivery technologies that we continue to seek t o commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, that are also included in the Other segment. 

&#160; 

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

&#160; 

While we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the Company , a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents; our significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments. Although the Company has several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2015 and are expected to expire during 2016 and 2017, the expiration of these patents , individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position or future operations. In addition , we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights . 

&#160; 

To the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY 

&#160; 

Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers. 

&#160; 

Instruments and consumables . Significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One &#160; consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and T 4 slides), VetLyte consumables, LaserCyte &#160; and LaserCyte Dx co nsumables, VetTest, VetAutoread and ProCyte Dx analyzers and consumables , SediVue Dx urinalysis instrument and components of our SNAP Pro Mobile Device. 

&#160; 

VetTest and Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest &#160; and Catalyst chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to IDEXX. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Other components . We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers. These products include certain diagnostic &#160; imaging systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products. 

&#160; 

Certain components incorporated into our SNAP products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by Moss, Inc. (&#8220;Moss&#8221;) under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice. Pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement, Moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components, which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render Moss incapable of supplying the components to us. If such a triggering event occurs, we will make royalty payments to Moss for the use of such information until Moss is able to again begin manufacturing. 

&#160; 

We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

BACKLOG 

&#160; 

We do not generally maintain significant backlog orders and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

We compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our different markets. In some markets, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Se veral of our direct and potential competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do. 

&#160; 

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Companion animal diagnostic offerings. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use and speed of our products, diagnostic accuracy, product quality, breadth of our product line and services, technology, information management capability, availability of medical consultation, effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, quality of our technical and customer service and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services in comparison with competitive products and services. Our major competitors in most geographic locations in North America are Antech Di agnostics, a unit of VCA Inc., Abaxis, Inc., Heska Corporation and Zoetis Inc . &#160; In 2015, following our transition to an all-direct sales and distribution model in the U.S., certain of our competitors began to sell products through our formerly exclusive U.S. distributors. See &#8220;Part II Item 7. Results of Operations and Trends&#8221; for more information. &#160; We also compete in international markets with Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, Arkray, Inc. and BioNote, Inc.

We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, product quality and other performance characteristics of our products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service, our ability to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies and our pricing relative to the value of our products in comparison with competitive products and services. Our competitors include highly focused smaller companies and multi-billion dollar companies with small livestock and poultry diagnostics and water testing solution franchises. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer information management and di agnostic imaging systems . We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our implementation, training process and customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services. We sell these products primarily in North America where our largest competitor is Henry Schein. 

&#183; 

Electrolyte and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market . We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products. We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics Corporation. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

Many of ou r products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses. 

&#160; 

Veterinary diagnostic products . Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (&#8220;APHIS&#8221;). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France has been approved by APHIS and we have a permit to import products manufactured in Montpellier, France to the U.S. for distribution. 

&#160; 

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220; FDA&#8221;) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the &#8220;FDC Act&#8221;). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded under the FDC Act. 

&#160; 

These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain European Conformity marking for their products. 

&#160; 

Water testing products . Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max xpress , Enterolert and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Dairy testing products . Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (&#8220;NCIMS&#8221;) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. However, before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Communities Research Institute (&#8220;AOAC RI&#8221;). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes. 

&#160; 

Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers . Our OPTI instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products. The FDA&#8217;s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, and which are submitted as a 510(k) application. OPTI Medical products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold. 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and other anti-competition authorities, and we are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and import and export laws and regulations, including U.S. import and export control and sanctions laws. A ny acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food safety, medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See &#8220;Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;
