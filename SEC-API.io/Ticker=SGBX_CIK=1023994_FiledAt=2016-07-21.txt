&#160; 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Background of SG Blocks, Inc. 

&#160; 

SG Blocks, Inc. was previously known as CDSI Holdings, Inc. and PC411, Inc., and was incorporated in Delaware on December 29, 1993. SG Blocks, Inc. (&#8220;SGB&#8221; and together with its subsidiaries, as context requires, is referred to herein as &#34;we,&#34; &#34;our,&#34; &#34;us&#34; or the &#34;Company&#34;). On January 12, 1999, the Company&#8217;s stockholders voted to change the corporate name of the Company from PC411, Inc. to CDSI Holdings Inc. Prior to May 1998, the Company&#8217;s principal business was an on-line electronic delivery information service that transmitted name, address, telephone number and other related information digitally to users of personal computers. In May 1998, the Company acquired Controlled Distribution Systems, Inc. (&#8220;CDS&#8221;), a company engaged in the marketing and leasing of an inventory control system for tobacco products. In February 2000, the Company announced that CDS will no longer actively engage in the business of marketing and leasing the inventory control system. In November 2003, the Company and CDS (a wholly-owned subsidiary) merged with the Company as the surviving corporation. Immediately prior to the merger between the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, CDSI Merger Sub, Inc. and SG Building (described below under the heading &#8220;SG Blocks Merger&#8221;) the Company was a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), seeking acquisition and investment opportunities. For a description of the Company&#8217;s Bankruptcy Proceedings and emergence from bankruptcy in June 2016, see Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Bankruptcy Proceedings. 

&#160; 

Background of SG Building Blocks, Inc. 

&#160; 

On October 25, 2010, SG Blocks, LLC (&#8220;SG LLC&#8221;), a Missouri limited liability company, merged with and into SG Building Blocks, Inc. (&#8220;SG Building&#8221;), which was formerly known as SG Blocks, Inc., then continued the business of SG LLC. SG LLC was formed on January 23, 2007 and SG Building was formed in Delaware on August 16, 2010. SG Building was not engaged in any business prior to the merger with SG LLC in 2010.

SG Blocks Merger 

&#160; 

On July 27, 2011, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) by and among the Company, CDSI Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), SG Building, and certain stockholders of SG Building. The merger contemplated by Merger Agreement was completed on November 4, 2011 (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into SG Building, with SG Building surviving the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary, and only operating business of, the Company. The Merger was a reverse merger that will be accounted for as a recapitalization of SG Building, and accordingly SG Building is deemed to be the accounting acquirer. 

&#160; 

Upon consummation of the Merger, the holders of common stock of SG Building received an aggregate of 36,050,764 shares of common stock in the Company. Additionally, Ladenburg Thalman &#38; Co. Inc. (&#34;Ladenburg&#34;) received in the Merger 408,750 shares of Company common stock pursuant to contractual obligations between SG Building and Ladenburg. Upon consummation of the Merger, all outstanding SG Building warrants were cancelled and substituted with warrants of similar tenor to purchase an aggregate of 1,145,510 shares of Company common stock. Immediately following the Merger, warrants to purchase 100,926 shares of Company common stock were forfeited by a warrant holder. As a result of the foregoing, the holders of Company common stock prior to the Merger owned an aggregate of 8% of the Company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the Merger, the stockholders and warrant holders of SG Building before the Merger beneficially owned an aggregate of 91% of the Company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the Merger, and Ladenburg owned an aggregate of 1% of the Company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the Merger (not including warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock it received in the Merger as a result of it holding warrants to purchase shares of SG Building common stock prior to the Merger). 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The principal business of the Company, through SG Building, is to provide code engineered cargo shipping containers. SG Building modifies and delivers containers to meet the growing demand for safe and green construction. Rather than consuming new steel and lumber, SG Building capitalizes on the structural engineering and design parameters a shipping container must meet and repurposes them for use in building. Offering a product that typically exceeds building code requirements, SG Building seeks to enable developers, architects, builders and owners to achieve greener construction, faster execution and stronger buildings of higher value. Since its inception in 2007, SG Building has developed and implemented the technology to break away from standardized container-construction while maintaining reduced costs. Committed to providing a construction methodology that will lessen the global carbon footprint, SG Building does not simply recycle (which requires additional energy consumption to break down material and then reform it for another purposes) &#8212; it utilizes existing steel material and repurposes it into modules that can be put to a higher and better use with significantly less energy input. In addition to providing code engineered cargo shipping containers for construction use, SG Building also continues to advance a proprietary structural steel framing system and the use thereof. 

&#160; 

During 2011, the Company formed SG Blocks Sistema De Constucao Brasileiro LTDA. (&#8220;SG Brazil&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. SG Brazil was formed in order to actively explore opportunities in Brazil. SG Brazil is currently inactive. 

&#160; 

SG Building&#8217;s products have been featured in reports by several leading media outlets including Fortune, NY Times, NY Post, USA Today, CNN, Washington Post, ABC World News, NBC Nightly News and Bob Vila. 

&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

SG Building first selects shipping containers appropriate for the project, often that have reached the end of their useful life, which are then designed and proprietarily engineered. These durable steel containers are then modified or manufactured under contract into a structure that is referred to in this &#8220;Description of Business&#8221; section as &#8220;SG Blocks&#8482;&#8221;. A combination of engineering and architecture is used to make the containers adaptable for a wide variety of commercial and residential uses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

From a design perspective, SG Blocks&#8482; can be used to build virtually any style of construction, from traditional to modern. SG Blocks&#8482; can be delivered with a highly durable surface finish or ready to be clad with any type of standard or green technology friendly building skin. 

&#160; 

SG Blocks&#8482; have a particular application in meeting safe and sustainable housing needs in the United States and globally. The building system is designed to meet the needs of builders, developers, government officials, urban planners, architects, and engineers looking for fast and affordable alternatives that meet safe housing needs and standards, particularly in hurricane and earthquake prone areas. Criteria and testing processes have been developed to evaluate each container. Conversion and assembly is subjected to quality control, making the containers &#8220;code-ready.&#8221; Conformance with International Code Council requirements is an ongoing objective as this standard is used by a vast majority of governmental jurisdictions in the United States. 

&#160; 

Partners, affiliates and customers carry the responsibility for container storage, modification, transportation and welding, leaving SG Building to manage the logistical task of coordinating the efforts of its strategic partners. These alliances help SG Building maintain a steady supply of containers available around the world. SG Building has been asked to explore by clients, international opportunities, including in Brazil where it has formed a subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Green Building 

&#160; 

There is a worldwide movement toward green and carbon neutrality. Sustainable or &#8220;green&#8221; building is the practice of designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and removing buildings in ways that conserve natural resources and reduce their impact on climate change. Builders are increasingly incorporating &#8220;green&#8221; components in all projects as they adopt the LEED system, a third-party certification program and the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high performance green buildings. We believe SG Building&#8217;s structural system contributes significantly towards LEED certification, and help minimize the wasteful practices of traditional construction methods. 

&#160; 

Description of the Product 

&#160; 

SG Building&#8217;s structural building system represents a change from the way buildings have typically been built in the past. It also represents a contribution to the greening of the construction industry with the advancement of new technology. Of great importance to the technology is the recycling of standard shipping containers. Intermodal containers generally come in either 40 foot or 20 foot long units that are either 8&#8217;6&#8221; (standard cube) or 9&#8217;6&#8221; (high cube). 

&#160; 

The payload rating in a shipping configuration for a 40 foot container is roughly 60,000 pounds. The payload rating normally associated with residential or commercial structures is in most cases half of that amount. These units are designed for 9-high stacking aboard ships. The structures in this condition need to be able to withstand 15 long tons of load transversely and 7.5 long tons longitudinally. This far exceeds any gravity or lateral loads a normal residential or commercial building will ever experience. 

&#160; 

This robust structure is the beginning of the SG Building building system. Various combinations as desired of siding, brick, and stucco can be added and the interior finished as any conventional structure would be. Upon completion, structures look and feel as if they were erected using traditional construction methods. However, the SG Building product is generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. 

&#160; 

Also, SG Building builds off of an alternative steel framing system that provides different benefits to customers. 

&#160;

The Process of the SG Building Conversion 

&#160; 

Containers are selected, starting with International Convention for Safe Containers (&#8220;CSC&#8221;) approved units, and evaluated against SG Building&#8217;s engineering, environmental, and utilization criteria and standards. The used containers are then certified as SG Blocks&#8482;, ready for the manufacturing and fabrication processes. SG Building then provides specific and detailed engineering and fabrication details to qualified contractors and subcontractors who then modify the containers in various configurations, which often require structural changes, wall reconfigurations, the creation of window and door openings, and ceiling alterations to allow sheetrock hanging. The exterior walls and roof structure are then insulated with a high tech waterproof ceramic insulation. The SG Blocks&#8482; are then shipped directly to the building site or are run through a modular factory and then delivered to the site. The builder, generally under contract with the Company, places the SG Blocks&#8482; into position on their foundation and connects them together by welding. The builder may then add roof trusses or other roof systems, quickly creating an insulated structure under roof. The potential for savings in building time can be significant, particularly if interior pre-finish modularization is introduced at this step.

Historical Use of Shipping Containers in Construction 

&#160; 

Although shipping containers have been reused as building structures since their introduction in the 1950s, such applications have been limited. Typically, shipping containers have been re-used to provide temporary shelter or storage. However, the idea of fabricating containers in large quantities for the building sector market is a relatively novel idea. 

&#160; 

Several companies and individuals have been touting the use of shipping containers for construction purposes. Very few, however, have actually designed and built structures to meet building code requirements. In contrast, SG Building has already completed projects for the US Military, municipalities and Fortune 500 companies. As a result, we believe SG Building is positioned as the leader in this new technology industry. 

&#160; 

We believe SG Building has debunked the architectural notion that structures built with containers look as if they were built with containers. Through concentrated education and promotion, we believe SG Building has already begun to position its concept into the vocabulary of the architecture and building industries. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The construction industry is highly competitive. SG Building competes against numerous local, regional, national and international builders and others in the real estate business around the world. Going forward, SG Building is committed to further educating the building community on the benefits of its technology to illustrate SG Building is more of a complement to than competition for builders. SG Building may compete for investment opportunities, financing, available land, raw materials and skilled labor with entities that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than it does. Competition may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise. Additionally, many of those working with containers focus on the architecture and design element. As the Company&#8217;s competitors are generally not involved with the entire building process (from container selection to occupancy), SG Building has an advantage in being able to deliver a final product. 

&#160; 

We believe SG Building can distinguish itself from its competitors on the basis of cost and construction time. SG Building&#8217;s construction method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects. Construction time is typically reduced by using SG Building&#8217;s construction method, reducing construction and soft costs substantially. The SG Blocks&#8482; are designed to be hurricane, tornado and blast resistant, able to withstand harsh climate conditions and their flexibility of construction allows architects, developers, and owners to design the product to meet their needs. 

&#160; 

Having already worked with regulatory agencies and obtained jurisdictional approvals from building departments, SG Building has gained practical experience needed to complement its engineering, architectural and technological knowledge. Standard permit approvals at the municipal level is the principal compliance and approval requirement for SG Building.

The SG Buildings Network 

&#160; 

One of our stockholders, ConGlobal Industries, Inc. (&#8220;ConGlobal&#8221;), is also one of our important affiliates. ConGlobal is one of the largest depot operators in the United States. ConGlobal operates container repair and storage depots throughout the United States, as well as in Costa Rica and Mexico, catering to major shipping, leasing and freight movement companies around the world. With a national capacity of over 600 acres, the ConGlobal network of maintenance depots currently handles over 6,500 containers per week and can accommodate at least 170,000 TEU&#8217;s (twenty-foot equivalent unit). Through SG Building, we currently have an exclusive 10 year Collaboration and Supply Agreement, dated July 23, 2007, with ConGlobal (the &#8220;ConGlobal Agreement&#8221;), which is currently being renegotiated. Each ConGlobal depot is equipped with the resources to modify used shipping containers into SG Building&#8217;s green building material. 

&#160; 

The ConGlobal Agreement, in its current form, generally provides that during the term of the ConGlobal Agreement, we will purchase our supply of SG Blocks&#8482; for SG Building&#8217;s business exclusively from ConGlobal within the &#8220;Territory&#8221;, as defined in the ConGlobal Agreement, and within the &#8220;Field of Use&#8221;, as defined in the ConGlobal Agreement. The ConGlobal Agreement defines &#8220;Territory&#8221; as all locations within the continental United States within a five hundred (500) mile radius of an existing ConGlobal site. The ConGlobal Agreement defines &#8220;Field of Use&#8221; as housing, office, and/or retail uses generally constructed as a permanent structures, but excludes uses exclusively for storage, mobile storage, temporary storage and commercial applications that: 

&#160; 

&#160; (1) are occupied by persons temporarily or infrequently (such as construction site temporary offices), or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) are not assembled into buildings consisting of greater than 6 containers in size and not intended for use as permanent housing, office, and/or retail structures, or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (3) are buildings of such nature that: (A) (i) they do not require a building or other permit or process from local government agencies, or (ii) are built from drawings, and/or specifications supplied to ConGlobal by the party buying the modified container(s) and (B) are for purposes that are not primarily for permanent housing, office and/or retail structures. &#160; 

In the event a proposed use of shipping containers by ConGlobal is not clearly within or outside of the Field of Use, ConGlobal will notify us of such proposed use and we will collaborate to determine whether such use is within the Field of Use and if so, whether (i) the proposed use by ConGlobal should be permitted; and (ii) if so, whether the proposed use should be performed on a shared or joint venture basis. 

&#160; 

The ConGlobal Agreement also provides that ConGlobal will not supply SG Blocks&#8482; to any entity competing with SG Building during the term of the ConGlobal Agreement unless SG Building fails to purchase at least sixty percent (60%) of its forecasted purchases, as defined, for two (2) consecutive years. 

&#160; 

We have five employees and two consultants. We also hire independent contractors on an as-needed basis.
