 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Capstone Turbine Corporation (&#8220;Capstone&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) develops, manufactures, markets and services microturbine technology solutions for use in stationary distributed power generation applications, including cogeneration (combined heat and power (&#8220;CHP&#8221;), integrated combined heat and power (&#8220;ICHP&#8221;), and combined cooling, heat and power (&#8220;CCHP&#8221;)), renewable energy, natural resources and critical power supply. In addition, our microturbines can be used as battery charging generators for hybrid electric vehicle applications. Microturbines allow customers to produce power on &#8209;site in parallel with the electric grid or stand-alone when no utility grid is available. Several technologies are used to provide &#8220;on &#8209;site power generation&#8221; (also called &#8220;distributed generation&#8221;) such as reciprocating engines, solar power, wind powered systems and fuel cells. For customers who do not have access to the electric utility grid, microturbines provide clean, on &#8209;site power with fewer scheduled maintenance intervals and greater fuel flexibility than competing technologies. For customers with access to the electric grid, microturbines provide an additional source of continuous duty power, thereby providing additional reliability and potential cost savings. With our stand &#8209;alone feature, customers can produce their own energy in the event of a power outage and can use microturbines as their primary source of power for extended periods. Because our microturbines also produce clean, usable heat energy, they provide economic advantages to customers who can benefit from the use of hot water, chilled water, air conditioning and heating. Our microturbines are sold, installed and serviced primarily through our global distribution network. Together we offer new and remanufactured parts as well as a comprehensive Factory Protection Plan (&#8220;FPP&#8221;). Successful implementation of microturbines relies on the quality of the microturbine, marketability for appropriate applications, and the quality of the installation and support. 

We believe we were the first company to offer a commercially available power source using microturbine technology. Capstone offers microturbines designed for commercial, industrial and utility users with product offerings ranging from 30 kilowatts (&#8220;kW&#8221;) to one megawatt in electric power output. Our 30 kW (&#8220;C30&#8221;) microturbine can produce enough electricity to power a small convenience store. The 65 kW (&#8220;C65&#8221;) microturbine can produce enough heat to provide hot water to a 100 &#8209;room hotel while also providing about one &#8209;third of its electrical requirements. Our 200 kW (&#8220;C200&#8221;) microturbine is well suited for larger hotels, office buildings and wastewater treatment plants, among others. By packaging the C200 microturbine power modules into an International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) sized container, Capstone has created a family of microturbine offerings from 600 kW up to one megawatt in a compact footprint. Our 600kW, 800kW and 1000 kW (&#8220;C1000 Series&#8221;) microturbines are well suited for utility substations, larger commercial and industrial facilities and remote oil and gas applications. Our microturbines combine patented air &#8209;bearing technology, advanced combustion technology and sophisticated power electronics to form efficient and ultra &#8209;low emission electricity and cooling and heat production systems. Because of our air &#8209;bearing technology, our microturbines do not require liquid lubricants. This means they do not require routine maintenance to change and dispose of oil or other liquid lubricants, as do the most common competing products. Capstone microturbines can be fueled by various sources, including natural gas, propane, sour gas, renewable fuels such as landfill or digester gas, kerosene, diesel and biodiesel. The C65 and C200 microturbines are available with integrated heat exchangers, making them easy to engineer and install in applications where hot water is used. Our products produce exceptionally clean power. Our natural gas &#8209;fueled C65 and C200 microturbines were certified by the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) as meeting its stringent 2007 emissions requirements&#8212;the same emissions standard used to certify fuel cells and the same emissions levels as a state &#8209;of &#8209;the &#8209;art central power plant. Our C65 and C200 Landfill and Digester Gas systems were certified by the CARB as meeting its 2008 waste gas emissions requirements for landfill and digester gas applications. 

On February 1, 2010, we acquired the 100 kW (&#8220;TA100&#8221;) microturbine product line from Calnetix Power Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;CPS&#8221;). The TA100 microturbine is most similar to the Capstone product design compared to other microturbine products in the industry. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, we decided to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers. We will continue to remanufacture engines and provide spare parts to our existing TA100 customers. 

&#160;

We sell complete microturbine units, subassemblies, components and various accessories. We also remanufacture microturbine engines and provide after &#8209;market parts and services. Our microturbines are sold primarily through distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;). Distributors purchase our products for sale to end users and also provide application engineering and installation support. Distributors are also required to provide a variety of additional services, including engineering the applications in which the microturbines will be used, installation support of the products at the end users&#8217; sites, commissioning the installed applications and providing post &#8209;commissioning service, including a comprehensive FPP. Our distributors perform as value &#8209;added resellers. OEMs integrate Capstone&#8217;s products into their own product solutions. 

To assure proper installation of Capstone microturbine systems, we have instituted a Factory Trained Installer (&#8220;FTI&#8221;) training and certification program. Personnel from our distributors and OEMs, as well as design engineering firms, contractors and end users attend this FTI training. We offer to assist all customers by reviewing their installation designs to confirm that the technical requirements for proper operation have been met, such as electrical interconnections, load requirements, fuel type and pressure, cooling air flow and turbine exhaust routing. As part of the microturbine commissioning process, we also receive a checklist to confirm that the final installation adheres to Capstone technical requirements before we accept any warranty obligations. This is aimed at providing the end user with a proper installation that will operate as expected for the life of the equipment. 

Through our global distribution network, we offer a comprehensive FPP for a fixed annual fee to perform regularly scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as needed. Capstone provides factory and on &#8209;site training to certify all personnel that are allowed to perform service on our microturbines. Individuals who are certified are called Authorized Service Providers (&#8220;ASPs&#8221;), and must be employed by a distributor in order to perform work pursuant to a Capstone FPP. The majority of our distributors provide these services. 

This Annual Report on Form 10 &#8209;K (this &#8220;Form 10 &#8209;K&#8221;) refers to Capstone&#8217;s fiscal years ending March 31 as its &#8220;Fiscal&#8221; years. 

Our Products 

We began commercial sales of our C30 products in 1998, targeting the emerging distributed generation industry that was being driven by fundamental changes in power requirements. In September 2000, we shipped the first commercial unit of our 60 kW microturbine (&#8220;C60&#8221;), which was replaced by the C65 model during the quarter ended March 31, 2006. We began shipping the C60 ICHP solution in 2003. Our C60 microturbine was the first combustion power generation product to be certified by the CARB as meeting its stringent distributed generation emissions standards that went into effect in 2003. The first commercial C200 microturbine was shipped on August 28, 2008. Our C1000 Series product was developed based on Capstone&#8217;s C200 microturbine engine. The C1000 Series product can be configured into 1,000 kW, 800 kW and 600 kW solutions in a single ISO &#8209;sized container. The first commercial shipment of our C1000 Series product was on December 29, 2008. We began shipping TA100 microturbines in March 2010. 

During Fiscal 2016, we booked total net orders of $53.9 million for 273 units, or 54.7 megawatts, compared to $84.5 million for 587 units, or 86.0 megawatts, during Fiscal 2015. We shipped 281 units with an aggregate of 60.0 megawatts, generating revenue of $58.4 million compared to 620 units with an aggregate of 91.4 megawatts, generating revenue of $90.4 million during Fiscal 2015. Total backlog as of March 31, 2016 decreased $56.2 million, or 34%, to $109.6 million from $165.7 million at March 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2016, we had 593 units, or 113.7 megawatts, in total backlog compared to 787 units, or 182.8 megawatts, at the same date last year. Ending backlog as of March 31, 2016, includes the removal of approximately $51.6 million for 186 units, or 63.8 megawatts, from BPC Engineering (&#8220;BPC&#8221;), one of the Company&#8217;s Russian distributors. This removal, which occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015, was a proactive measure taken to align our backlog to management&#8217;s expectations because of the unsteady global macroeconomic environment experienced during Fiscal 2015, such as the softness of the global oil and gas market, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and on-going geopolitical tensions in Russia. In addition, a portion of our TA100 backlog of approximately $2.4 million for 17 units, or 1.7 megawatts, acquired from CPS was removed during the three months ended March 31, 2016. This impairment aligns our TA100 backlog with management&#8217;s decision to limit the production of TA100 systems on a case-by-case basis for key customers. A significant portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may 

&#160;

impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue. The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers. However, based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months. The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue.

Capstone microturbines are compact, lightweight and environmentally friendly generators of electricity and heat compared to competing technologies. They operate on the same principle as a jet engine with the added capability of using a variety of commercially available fuels. For example, our microturbines can operate on low British Thermal Unit (&#8220;BTU&#8221;) gas, which is gas with lower energy content, and can also operate on gas with a high amount of sulfur, known in the industry as sour gas. Examples of these fuel sources include methane from facilities such as wastewater treatment plants, landfills and anaerobic digesters. 

Our microturbines incorporate four major design features: advanced combustion technology, patented air &#8209;bearing technology, digital power electronics and remote monitoring capability. 

Our advanced combustion technology allows Capstone microturbines to achieve low emissions with a design geared towards manufacturability. These low emission levels not only provide an environmentally friendly product, but also eliminate permitting requirements in several municipalities for continuously operated onsite power generation. The air &#8209;bearing system allows the microturbine&#8217;s single moving assembly to produce power without the need for typical petroleum &#8209;based lubrication. Air &#8209;bearings use a high &#8209;pressure field of air rather than petroleum lubricants. This improves reliability and reduces maintenance such as oil changes. The electronic controls manage critical functions and monitor operations of the microturbine, such as; our electronic controls manage the microturbine&#8217;s speed, temperature and fuel flow and communication with external networks and building management systems. The power electronics coordinate with the grid when the units are operated in a grid &#8209;connect mode and with the onboard battery when equipped for stand &#8209;alone mode. All control functions are performed digitally. Performance is optimized, resulting in lower emissions, higher reliability and high efficiency over a variable power range. Our proprietary Capstone Remote Monitoring Software (&#8220;CRMS&#8221;) allows end users to operate and manage the microturbine remotely. Unlike the technology of other power sources that require on &#8209;site monitoring and maintenance, the CRMS allows end users to monitor their microturbine systems remotely and efficiently. This remote capability can provide end users with power generation flexibility and cost savings. 

The electrical output of our units can be paralleled in multiple unit configurations through our Advanced Power Server product and a digital communications cable to serve larger installations requiring electrical loads up to ten megawatts. 

Our products can operate: 

&#183; 

connected to the electric utility grid as a current source; 

&#160;

&#183; 

on a stand &#8209;alone basis as a voltage source; 

&#183; 

multipacked to support larger loads as a &#8220;virtual single&#8221; unit; and 

&#183; 

in dual mode, where the microturbine operates connected to the electric utility grid or operates independently. 

We also offer C65, C200 and C1000 Series ICHP systems. These systems combine the standard C65, C200 and C1000 microturbine unit with an integrated heat recovery module that provides electricity and heats water.

We offer various accessories for our products including rotary gas compressors with digital controls, integrated heat recovery modules for CHP applications, dual mode controllers that allow automatic transition between grid connect and stand &#8209;alone modes, batteries with digital controls for stand &#8209;alone or dual &#8209;mode operations, power servers for large multipacked installations, protocol converters for Internet access, packaging options and miscellaneous parts such as frames, exhaust ducting and installation hardware. We also sell microturbine components and subassemblies. 

Our electronic controls manage microturbines using Capstone&#8217;s proprietary software and advanced algorithms. The controls: 

&#183; 

start the turbogenerator and manage its load; 

&#183; 

coordinate the functioning of the microturbine with the grid; 

&#183; 

manage the speed, fuel flow and exhaust temperature of the microturbine; 

&#183; 

convert the variable frequency, up to a maximum of 1,600 Hertz and variable voltage power produced by the generator into a usable output of either 50 or 60 Hertz AC for stationary applications or DC for hybrid electric vehicle applications; and 

&#183; 

provide digital communications to externally maintain and control the equipment. 

The C30 microturbines were initially designed to operate connected to an electric utility grid and to use a high pressure natural gas fuel source. We have expanded our microturbine&#8217;s functionality to operate with different fuels. The combustor system remains the same for all fuels except for the fuel injectors, which currently vary between liquid and gaseous fuels. The Capstone microturbine&#8217;s multi &#8209;fuel capability provides significant competitive advantages with respect to some of our selected vertical markets. 

&#160;

Our C65 grid &#8209;connect and stand &#8209;alone microturbines are listed by Underwriters Laboratories (&#8220;UL&#8221;) as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements. Our products are manufactured by processes that are ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 certified. 

In 2002, the California Energy Commission certified our C30 and C60 microturbines as the first products to comply with the requirements of its &#8220;Rule 21&#8221; grid interconnection standard. This standard streamlines the process for connecting distributed generation systems to the grid in California. The benefits of achieving this standard include avoiding both costly external equipment procurement requirements and extensive site &#8209;by &#8209;site and utility &#8209;by &#8209;utility analysis. Our protective relay functionality has also been recognized by the State of New York, which has pre &#8209;cleared our microturbines for connection to New York&#8217;s electric utility grid. 

The TA100 microturbine offers a digital communication interface which can be connected to an external controller (not sold by Capstone) to provide multiple unit and dual mode dispatching functionality. An external synchronization board is provided to parallel the electrical output in multiple unit configurations for stand &#8209;alone operation. 

We are the first microturbine manufacturer to achieve UL Class I, Division 2 certification for operation in hazardous &#8209;area oil and gas applications. These specially packaged systems are applied in oil and gas production areas with potentially explosive environments. In September 2009, we received UL certification for our C200 grid &#8209;connect and stand &#8209;alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements. In June 2010, we received UL certification for our C1000 Series grid &#8209;connect and stand &#8209;alone microturbine as meeting the UL 2200 stationary engine generator standards and the UL 1741 utility interconnection requirements. 

Applications 

Worldwide, stationary power generation applications vary from huge central stationary generating facilities up to 1,000 MW to back &#8209;up generators as small as 2 kW. Historically, power generation in most developed countries such as the United States has been part of a regulated utility system. A number of developments related primarily to the deregulation of the utility industry as well as significant technology advances have broadened the range of power supply choices available to all types of customers. 

Capstone products serve multiple vertical markets worldwide. Within the markets served, we focus on vertical markets that we have identified as having the greatest near &#8209;term potential. In the markets we are focusing on, which are energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power supply, transportation and marine, we have identified specific targeted vertical market segments. 

Energy Efficiency&#8212;CHP/CCHP 

Energy efficiency maximizes the use of energy produced by the microturbines, reduces emissions compared with traditional power generation and enhances the economic advantage to customers. Energy efficiency uses both the heat and electric energy produced in the power generation process. Using the heat and electricity created from a single combustion process increases the efficiency of the system from approximately 30% to 80% or more. The increased operating efficiency reduces overall greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional independent sources such as power generation and local thermal generation and, through displacement of other separate systems, can reduce operating costs. Our microturbines&#8217; emissions of commonly found air pollutants (&#8220;criteria pollutants&#8221;), such as nitrogen oxides (&#8220;NOx&#8221;), carbon monoxide (&#8220;CO&#8221;) and volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;), are lower than those from the on &#8209;site boilers that our CHP system displaces, meaning that local emissions of these pollutants are actually reduced when a Capstone energy efficiency CHP system is installed. This high CHP efficiency also means more efficient use of fuel and can reduce net utility costs for end users. The most common uses of heat energy include space heating and air conditioning, heating and cooling water, as well as drying and other applications. For example, we have used the heat generated by the microturbines to supply hot water solutions for hotels, office buildings and retail, commercial and industrial customers. When our microturbine exhaust drives an absorption chiller, the chiller produces chilled water for air conditioning and other uses. 

&#160;

There are energy efficiency markets for CHP and CCHP applications worldwide. Many governments have encouraged more efficient use of the power generation process to reduce pollution, lower dependence on fossil fuels and control the cost of locally produced goods. To access these markets, we have entered into agreements with distributors which have engineered energy efficiency CHP packages that utilize the hot exhaust air of the microturbine for heating water and also use the hot exhaust to run an absorption chiller for air conditioning. We also offer our own integrated energy efficiency CHP and CCHP product for the C65, C200 and C1000 Series products. 

Each dual-mode microturbine can operate as a microgrid with the ability to run with or independent of a traditional grid or utility. The use of microgrids to serve local loads helps to reduce energy losses in transmission and distribution, further increasing the efficiency of the microgrid. Our microturbines have the ability to meet the needs of microgrid end users by lowering their overall cost to operate and provide versatile technology that runs on varying fuels and scales to fit a wide variety of applications. 

Renewable Energy 

Our microturbines can use renewable methane gases from landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and other small biogas applications such as food processing and agricultural waste, referred to as green waste, and cow, pig and chicken manure. They can burn these renewable waste gases with minimal emissions, thereby, in some cases, avoiding the imposition of penalties incurred for pollution while simultaneously producing electricity from this &#8220;free&#8221; renewable fuel for use at the site or in the surrounding areas. The microturbines have demonstrated effectiveness in these smaller applications and may outperform conventional combustion engines in some situations, including when the gas contains a high amount of sulfur. 

Capstone introduced the C65 and C200 stand &#8209;alone digester products in the renewable energy market segment in 2007 and 2013, respectively. These products are targeted at remote villages in third &#8209;world countries with wastewater treatment facilities that offer a valuable source of fuel which can be converted to electricity. A joint applications and engineering team evaluated the performance of the existing C65 digester gas system to ensure that the combustion system would be stable from 0 to 100% power output. Minor controls changes were implemented to increase stability at low power levels. The ability to convert this low BTU fuel to electricity along with the high reliability and low maintenance features of this product make it well suited for this market. 

Natural Resources&#8212;Oil, Natural Gas, Shale Gas &#38; Mining 

On a worldwide basis, there are thousands of locations where the drilling, production, compression and transportation of natural resources and other extraction and production processes create fuel byproducts, which traditionally have been released or burned into the atmosphere. Our microturbines are installed in the natural resource market to be used in oil and gas exploration, production, compression and transmission sites both onshore and offshore as a highly reliable source of power generation. In addition, our microturbines can use flare gas as a fuel to provide prime power. In some cases these oil and gas or mining operations have no electric utility grid and rely solely on Capstone&#8217;s microturbine for reliable low emission power supply. 

Many major oil and gas companies are exploring large shale reserves, or plays, in the United States. In mid &#8209;2010 Capstone sold its first microturbines into the U.S. shale gas market in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shale plays. The addressable market for Capstone microturbines in this industry is significant. The shale gas market for microturbines may grow as demand for natural gas continues to rise and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the Department of the Interior and other federal and state agencies work to reduce emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants associated with natural gas development. Capstone has been invited to participate in numerous Natural Gas STAR workshops in the United States and foreign markets to demonstrate the emissions reductions our technology can provide. 

The C200 product can be configured to meet Class 1 Zone 2 hazardous location requirements for the oil and gas market. Hazardous location requirements are met through package ventilation changes for purging and pressurizing package air to avoid potential flammable mixtures as well as controls for emergency disconnect of fuel and electrical sources. The package is upgraded to stainless steel construction to withstand the corrosive offshore environments where 

&#160;

these units are installed. Oil and gas customers prefer the low maintenance and high reliability attributes offered by our turbines to ensure continued production. Capstone also offers C30 and C65 microturbine products in similar configurations. 

Critical Power Supply 

Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of even momentary system failure, certain power users such as high technology, health care and information systems facilities require particularly high levels of reliability in their power service. To meet these customer requirements, traditional solutions utilize Uninterruptible Power Supplies (&#8220;UPS&#8221;) to protect critical loads from momentary power disturbances along with backup diesel generators for extended outages. Capstone offers an alternative solution that can both meet customer reliability requirements and reduce operating costs. 

Capstone has developed the world&#8217;s only microturbine-powered UPS solutions that offer clean, IT &#8209;grade power and can completely displace the need for traditional UPS and backup diesel generators. We offer two microturbine &#8209;powered UPS solutions. The Capstone UPSource microturbine &#8209;powered UPS solution provides prime or emergency power solutions. Capstone&#8217;s Hybrid UPS microturbine-powered solution provides power when dispatched in high efficiency, standard UPS and emergency power solutions. Both critical power supply products offer 99.999999% availability in an n+1 configuration when the product has at least one independent backup. Our microturbine &#8209;powered UPS solutions are UL listed. These integrated solutions are ideal for new construction or facility expansion and have been installed with absorption chillers or other heat recovery systems to obtain high efficiency and reduce operating costs compared with traditional solutions. 

Dual mode units operating in a prime power configuration can support a 150% overload for 10 seconds during transient conditions. Dual mode units operating in grid parallel mode can provide customers a back &#8209;up power system with an economic return. These systems offer high on-site energy efficiency when combined with a heat exchanger (CHP) to create hot water or with a chiller (CCHP) for air conditioning at these facilities. This configuration, when combined with the Capstone Dual Mode Controller, can transition from the grid parallel mode to prime power mode in less than ten seconds. Capstone microturbines can also be installed along with a rotary UPS to provide a complete line &#8209;interactive continuous power solution. In this case, the microturbines remain in grid connect mode while the rotary UPS stabilizes the utility voltage and provides a seamless transfer from operation connected to the grid to operation isolated from the grid. 

Transportation 

Our technology is also used in hybrid electric vehicle (&#8220;HEV&#8221;) applications. Our customers have applied our products in HEVs such as transit buses and trucks. In these applications the microturbine acts as an onboard battery charger to recharge the battery system as needed. The benefits of microturbine hybrids include extended range, fuel economy gains, quieter operation, reduced emissions and higher reliability compared with traditional internal combustion engines. Internal combustion diesel engine manufacturers have been challenged for the last several years to develop technology improvements, prior to aftertreatment that reduce emissions to levels specified by the EPA and CARB 2007 and 2010 standards. Many manufacturers are incorporating aftertreatment that increases upfront equipment costs, vehicle weight and life cycle costs and may reduce overall engine efficiency. 

Marine 

Our technology is also used in marine applications. Our customers have applied our products in the commercial vessel and luxury yacht markets. The most immediate market for our marine products is for use as a ship auxiliary engine. In this application, the microturbines provide power to the vessel&#8217;s electrical loads and, in some cases, the vessel is able to utilize the exhaust energy to increase the overall efficiency of the application, reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions. The other application is similar to our HEV application where the vessel is driven by an electric propulsion system and the microturbine serves as an on board range extender. Our marine customers use both our liquid fueled and natural gas products. Liquefied natural gas (&#8220;LNG&#8221;) is in its early stages as a marine fuel, and the number of vessels powered by LNG is forecasted to double every two years over the next decade. Vessel owners can 

&#160;

receive the same benefits as users of stationary Capstone products: low emissions with no aftertreatment, long maintenance intervals, high reliability, low noise and no vibration. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We primarily sell our microturbine product, parts and service through distributors. Our world &#8209;wide distribution network is our most valuable intangible asset that we have proudly developed from the ground up. Each one of our distributors is a strategically placed independent partner of Capstone marketing and selling the Capstone products and services on our behalf. Our typical terms of sale include shipment of the products with title, care, custody and control transferring at our dock, payment terms ranging from full payment in advance of shipment to payment in 90 days, and warranty periods of approximately 15 to 24 months from shipment depending on the product type. We typically do not have customer acceptance provisions in our agreements. 

United States and Canada 

We have distribution agreements with a number of companies throughout North America for the resale of our products. Many of these distributors serve multiple markets in their select geographic regions. The primary markets served in this region have been energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power and mobile products. The energy efficiency and natural resources vertical markets are expected to grow as a result of an increased domestic production of hydrocarbons, the low downstream price of natural gas and public and regulatory acceptance of distributed generation. 

In developing our sales opportunities we have identified the need to address various requirements present in our target localities. These requirements include electric grid interconnection standards, gas utility connection requirements, emissions standards, building and fire safety codes and various inspections and approvals. The costs and scheduling ramifications of these various approvals, in conjunction with normal bidding process requirements and construction delays, can be significant to the completion of an installation. Our goal is to work with the applicable regulating entities to establish compliant standards for the installation of our microturbines so that the costs and installation timelines are minimized for our customers. Management believes that we can create market advantages for our products through enhancing the ease of deploying our distributed generation solutions. 

Latin America 

Our target markets in Latin America are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Oil and gas production projects continue to be a growing market in Latin America. 

Recent energy reform in Mexico has opened new market opportunities by allowing competition and enabling power generation companies to sell directly to consumers instead of only to the state &#8209;owned Federal Electricity Commission. Capstone&#8217;s strategy in Mexico is to leverage our distribution network in Mexico across various market verticals. 

South America constitutes a diverse group of markets that vary greatly in potential capture for Capstone based on a number of factors, including availability of oil and gas production and transmission, energy pricing and political and investment climate. While Capstone has distributors in nearly all South American countries, management is focused on what we consider to be the top markets, such as Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador. Our historical sales in South America have primarily been in the natural resources market. 

Asia and Australia 

Our sales and marketing strategy in Asia and Australia has been to develop and strengthen distributor relationships throughout these continents. 

Our target markets in Asia and Australia are energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural resources. Our historical sales in Southeast Asia and Australia have primarily been in the CHP, CCHP and the oil and gas market. Other 

&#160;

areas in Asia and the Pacific Rim offer attractive opportunities as well. China is expected to see growth in the oil and gas market, while biogas recovery is showing signs of growth in Southeast Asia. 

Middle East and Africa 

Our target market in the Middle East and Africa is primarily oil and gas. Flare gas to power projects are a particularly attractive market opportunity given the volume of gas being flared and the acute and chronic need for stable power in the region. Management has targeted distributors and customers involved in the capture and use of flare gas in the oil and gas market. However, the geopolitical environment in this region is still volatile, which can impact our sales. 

Europe and Russia 

To address the European market, including Russia, we are strengthening our relationships with existing and new distributors and have increased Capstone local sales and service support. We have an office in Europe for the purpose of working with our distributors there on a daily basis to realize growth opportunities. We have established a spare parts distribution center in Europe to make parts readily available to our distributors. Europe has a history of extensive use of distributed generation technologies. During Fiscal 2016, the pace of economic recovery in Europe was slow and demand remained soft with a decrease in revenue of 43%, primarily from Russia, compared to Fiscal 2015. Further, the continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could continue to negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region. For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on Page 16 of this Form 10 &#8209;K.

Additionally, DTC, Optimal, Reliable Secure Power Systems, one of the Company&#8217;s domestic distributors (&#8220;RSP&#8221;), and Regale Energy Zrt, the Company&#8217;s Hungarian distributor (&#8220;Regale&#8221;), accounted for 28%, 11%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2016. Optimal accounted for 17% of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2015. 

We recorded bad debt recovery of approximately $1.5 million during Fiscal 2016. We recorded bad debt expense of approximately $10.1 million and $0.2 million during Fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. During Fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million with respect to the accounts receivable allowances from BPC and Electro Mecanique Industries (&#8220;EMI&#8221;), one of the Company&#8217;s distributors in the Middle East and Africa, respectively. 

Competition 

The market for our products is highly competitive. Our microturbines compete with existing technologies such as reciprocating engines and may also compete with emerging distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind &#8209;powered systems, fuel cells and other microturbines. Many potential customers rely on the utility grid for their electrical power. Many of our distributed generation competitors are large, well &#8209;established 

&#160;

companies that derive competitive advantages from production economies of scale, worldwide presence, brand recognition and greater resources which they can devote to product development or promotion. 

Generally, power purchased from the electric utility grid is less costly than power produced by distributed generation technologies. Utilities may also charge fees to interconnect to their power grids. However, we can provide economic benefits to end users in instances where the waste heat from our microturbine has value (CHP and CCHP), where fuel costs are low (renewable energy/renewable fuels), where the costs of connecting to the grid may be high or impractical (such as remote power applications), where reliability and power quality are of critical importance, or in situations where peak shaving could be economically advantageous because of highly variable electricity prices. Because Capstone microturbines can provide a reliable source of power and can operate on multiple fuel sources, management believes they offer a level of flexibility not currently offered by other technologies such as reciprocating engines. 

Our reciprocating engine competitors have products and markets that are well developed and technologies that have been proven for some time. A reciprocating engine, also known as an internal combustion engine, is similar to those used in automotive applications. Reciprocating engines are popular for primary and back &#8209;up power applications despite higher levels of emissions, noise and maintenance. These technologies, which in many cases have a lower up &#8209;front cost than microturbines, are currently produced by American DG Energy Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz Corporation, GE Gas Engines (which now includes Waukesha and Jenbacher), MAN SE, Tecogen, Inc. and W&#228;rtsil&#228; Corporation, among others. 

Our microturbines may also compete with other distributed generation technologies, including solar-powered systems, wind-powered systems, fuel cells and fly wheel. Solar and wind powered systems produce no emissions. The main drawbacks to solar and wind powered systems are their dependence on weather conditions, the utility grid and high capital costs that can often make these systems uneconomical without government subsidies depending upon geographic locale and application of the technology. Although the market for fuel cells is still developing, a number of companies are focused on markets similar to ours, including Active Power Inc., Ballard Power Systems Inc., Bloom Energy Corporation, FuelCell Energy Inc., LG Fuel Cell Systems, a business unit of LG Electronics, and Plug Power Inc. Fuel cells have lower levels of NOx, CO, VOCs and other criteria pollutant emissions than our microturbines. Fuel cells, like solar and wind powered systems, have received higher levels of incentives for the same type of applications as microturbines. Management believes that, absent these higher government incentives, microturbines provide a better value to end users in most applications. However, over the medium &#8209;to &#8209;long term, fuel cell technology companies may introduce products that compete more directly with our microturbines. 

We also compete with other companies who have microturbine products, including FlexEnergy and Turbec S.p.A. 

Overall, we compete with end users&#8217; other options for electrical power and heat generation on the basis of our microturbine&#8217;s ability to: 

&#183; 

provide power when a utility grid is not available or goes out of service; 

&#183; 

reduce total cost of purchasing electricity and fuel; 

&#183; 

improve electric power availability and provide high power quality; 

&#183; 

operate on multiple fuel types; 

&#183; 

reduce emissions (both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases); 

&#183; 

simplify operation; and 

&#183; 

control maintenance costs and associated disposal of hazardous materials. 

&#160;

Governmental and Regulatory Impact 

Our markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets in which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities may place barriers on the installation or interconnection of our product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on &#8209;site power generation; thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back &#8209;up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our product, or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our distributed generation solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance in a lower cost, more efficient manner. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards. 

Capstone continues to engage with federal and state policymakers to develop government programs to promote the deployment of Capstone&#8217;s low emission and energy efficient products. In California, A.B. 1530 recently was approved by the Senate Energy Committee and will be heard next by the Senate Environmental Quality Committee. This bill may stimulate the market in California for Capstone products by revising utility charges and standby rates that apply to distributed generation projects. We cannot provide assurance that any such legislation will be enacted, however. In the wake of numerous destructive storms, several state and local governments are putting greater value in resilient distributed generation resources, including CHP and microgrids, and even reassessing the traditional utility model. However, utilities in other states have asked public utility commissioners to revisit incentive programs and exemptions from grid usage charges for distributed generation technologies, arguing that these policies shift costs to other rate payers. 

The United States Government is focused on promoting exports of American products with a specific emphasis on clean energy goods. Capstone participates in export promotion activities such as trade missions which help us enter new markets by facilitating interactions with foreign buyers and distributors. Government funding can impact the rate of development of new technologies. Competing new technologies generally receive larger incentives and development funding than do microturbines. There are certain recent federal funding solicitations that may support microturbine development. We cannot provide any assurance that any proposal Capstone submits will be funded. The Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for certain clean energy technologies, including CHP, microturbines and fuel cells among others, is set to expire at the end of calendar year 2016. There are bipartisan efforts underway to extend the ITC an additional five years, similar to the extension provided for solar energy technology projects. Unless it is extended, we may see an impact on our sales in the United States due to the loss of this 10% tax credit. However, other CHP and gas-fired distributed energy technology-providers will face the same financial hurdle and the loss of the ITC would level the playing field with fuel cell technologies, which currently receive a 30% ITC. 

Sourcing and Manufacturing 

We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. Our microturbines are designed to achieve high volume and low cost production objectives. Our manufacturing designs include the use of conventional technology, which has been proven in high volume automotive and turbocharger production for many years. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off &#8209;the &#8209;shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, adequate capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We have an on &#8209;going program to develop alternative back &#8209;up suppliers for sole source parts. We regularly reassess the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. We continue to evaluate and implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier 

&#160;

controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost &#8209;improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness. Our ability to leverage these capabilities may be affected by the current variability in our demand volumes and forecasting. Our demand volumes and forecasting could continue to be impacted by the softness of the global oil and gas markets, a substantially stronger U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Russia, North Africa and the Middle East. Our strategy is to identify primary and secondary sources for critical components when available to minimize factory down time due to unavailability of such parts, which could affect our ability to meet manufacturing schedules. 

We have a combined total of approximately 102,000 square foot manufacturing footprint running on a single shift in the San Fernando Valley area of Southern California. We assemble and test units as well as manufacture air &#8209;bearings and certain combustion system components at our facility in Chatsworth, California. Additionally, we assemble and test our C200 and C1000 Series products and manufacture recuperator cores at our facility in Van Nuys, California. Management believes our manufacturing facilities located in Chatsworth and Van Nuys, California have a combined production capacity of approximately 2,000 units per year, depending on product mix. Excluding working capital requirements, management believes we can expand our combined production capacity to approximately 4,000 units per year, depending on product mix, with approximately $10 to $15 million of capital expenditures. We have not committed to this expansion nor identified a source for its funding, if available. 

Solar Turbines Incorporated (&#8220;Solar&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., was our sole supplier of recuperator cores prior to 2001. In 2000, we exercised an option to license Solar&#8217;s technology, which allows us to manufacture these cores ourselves and we began manufacturing them in June 2001. The cores are subject to a per &#8209;unit royalty fee which continues for the duration of Solar&#8217;s intellectual property that underlies the licensing agreement. As of March 31, 2016, cumulative royalties of $0.6 million have been paid under the terms of the licensing agreement with Solar. 

The Company is a party to a Development and License Agreement (&#8220;Development Agreement&#8221;) with Carrier Corporation (&#8220;Carrier&#8221;) regarding the payment of royalties on the sale of each of the Company&#8217;s C200 microturbines. As of March 31, 2016, cumulative royalties of $16.6 million have been paid under the terms of the Development Agreement with Carrier will continue until the obsolescence of the C200 microturbine product line. 

Research and Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) 

We devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products. We focus our engineering efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective and timely manner. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, R&#38;D expenses were $10.2 million, $9.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively, which amounts are equivalent to 12%, 8% and 7% of total revenue, respectively, for these fiscal years. R&#38;D expenses are reported net of benefits from cost &#8209;sharing programs, such as DOE grants. Benefits from cost &#8209;sharing programs were $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $1.4 million for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our R&#38;D activities enabled us to become one of the first companies to develop a commercially available microturbine that operates in parallel with the grid. We were the first company to successfully demonstrate a commercially available microturbine that operates on a stand &#8209;alone basis. 

During Fiscal 2016, we unveiled the Capstone C1000 Signature (&#8220;C1000S&#8217;) microturbine as part of our new C1000S microturbine energy systems which also includes an 800kW (&#8220;C800S&#8221;) or 600kW (&#8220;C600S&#8221;) microturbine. The C1000S microturbine incorporates over 70 components, system and design upgrades intended to improve the overall product quality and enhance the microturbine ownership experience in all applications but specifically for CHP and CCHP applications. A few of the key upgrades include integrated heat recovery for CHP and CCHP applications, two-stage air filtration system, improved enclosure, relocated engine exhaust stack and redesigned discharge for enclosure cooling air. The C1000S is one of the world&#8217;s most integrated and compact 1MW CHP solutions. The 8-foot wide by 30-foot long 1MW power plant reaches approximately 82% total system efficiency and is significantly quieter than the original C1000 for installation in low-noise urban environments. 

&#160;

During Fiscal 2015 we made significant development in variants of the C1000 Series product line. A liquid fuel version of the C1000 Series was produced with the use of Capstone&#8217;s lean premix combustion technology based on the development work done previously with the C200 liquid fuel system. Liquid fuel products are well suited for markets where customers do not have access to gaseous fuels but still demand the low emissions, low maintenance, and high reliability benefits offered by Capstone&#8217;s microturbine products. Additionally, a dual &#8209;mode (grid connect &#38; stand-alone capability) Digester gas C1000 was produced to run off the Palm Oil Milling Effluent (&#8220;POME&#8221;) biogas produced as a byproduct of the palm oil extraction process. Advancement realized in both of these products opens up new markets for Capstone and also allows for further development possibilities in the areas of liquid fuel and biogas. 

During Fiscal 2014 we achieved compliance with the German low voltage requirements, which have been adopted throughout much of Europe. During Fiscal 2015 we continued to make improvements to all our microturbine products to be compliant with other widely adopted European low and medium voltage grid inter &#8209;connect requirements for decentralized power generation. During Fiscal 2016 our C65, C200 and C1000 Series microturbines were certified for multiple European Grid Interconnection standards. These new standards, which are Verband der Elektrotechnik (&#8220;VDE&#8221;), Bundesverband der Energie - und Wasserwirtschaft (BDEW) and Comitato Electtrotecnico Italiano (&#8220;CEI&#8221;), were attained following the development and implementation of new microturbine system software architecture. With this certification, Capstone&#8217;s C200 and C1000 Series microturbines are capable of operating through periods of lower grid voltage, also known as low voltage ride through (&#8220;LVRT&#8221;), without any adverse effects on performance or reliability. LVRT capability is important because it ensures that the microturbines can &#8216;ride through&#8217; the low voltage period, especially for mission critical facilities, such as hospitals and data centers. The VDE, BDEW and CEI requirements for power generation products and plants are based on unit behavior during cases of grid disturbances. 

In addition, we continue to work both cost reduction and performance enhancement activities to improve the value of our microturbine products for our customer base. Cost reduction activities are focused on leveraging the capabilities of our supply base and internal design lean manufacturing improvements. Product enhancements are focused on reducing the already very low maintenance requirements for our products, while at the same time improving operational efficiency, thereby reducing our customers&#8217; total cost of ownership. 

Because of Capstone&#8217;s single moving assembly, manufacturers believe there is also the opportunity to produce a lower cost product in larger automotive volumes. Our focus is on a next generation product that would include existing components and a liquid &#8209;cooled set of electronics that are consistent with the size, cost and cooling strategies employed on vehicles today. Although we believe the hybrid electric bus and truck market has the potential to be a beneficial option for the bus and truck manufacturers, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability. 

Capstone is working with the Kenworth Truck Company to demonstrate a Class 7 series hybrid delivery truck with funding support from the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. This truck will be operated on actual customer delivery routes in both air districts to quantify the performance, emissions, fuel economy, and other benefits of a microturbine &#8209;based hybrid solution. The Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck is currently being retrofitted with a refrigerated box body and should be ready for track testing at Kenworth facilities later in the year. The truck will then be used in a demonstration phase to a large commercial customer within the San Joaquin Valley in California. Capstone expects to collect and utilize information from the Kenworth Class 7 hybrid truck&#8217;s road testing and demonstration processes for future product developments and enhancements. A prototype or concept vehicle may take several years to go into commercial production following completion of rigorous testing. 

Capstone also worked with Peterbilt Motors to develop a series hybrid drivetrain as part of a concept Class 8 tractor for Walmart. The Walmart Advanced Vehicle Experience (&#8220;WAVE&#8221;) concept truck is the latest in Walmart&#8217;s fleet efficiency program. The WAVE concept truck has advanced aerodynamics and is powered by a Capstone C30 range &#8209;extending microturbine in its hybrid powertrain. This futuristic concept truck was unveiled at the Mid America Trucking Show in March 2014. Future development efforts will be based on the lessons learned from these programs. As such, Capstone is working with both Peterbilt and Walmart as they continue to showcase the WAVE truck at various expos and hybrid vehicle shows around the country. 

&#160;

Capstone&#8217;s liquid fuel microturbines have demonstrated emissions levels which meet the CARB 2010 standards for Heavy Duty Diesel Engines (&#8220;HDDE&#8221;). The liquid fuel microturbine is able to meet these extremely low emissions requirements using its lean premix combustion technology with no exhaust aftertreatment. Competitive reciprocating engine technologies require aftertreatment components that increase system cost, require frequent maintenance, and impact engine efficiency. Capstone&#8217;s compressed natural gas (&#8220;CNG&#8221;) fueled microturbines also meet extremely low emission standards, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and CARB 2010 emissions requirements for On &#8209;Road HDDE for Urban Bus. Test emissions from our natural gas microturbines measured dramatically less than the emissions levels set forth by the CARB standard including NOx at 75% and CO at 96% less than the required levels. 

Capstone&#8217;s marine products can be used to provide hybrid electric marine propulsion, &#8220;hotel power,&#8221; CHP, or CCHP. They are especially ideal for small &#8209; and mid &#8209;size commercial ships that travel inland waterways and emissions controlled areas (&#8220;ECAs&#8221;). Capstone has also working with major marine certifying bodies (Lloyd&#8217;s Register and DNV &#8209;GL) on Type Approval for its marine products. Type Approval provides independent product verification that the product conforms to recognized industry quality standards, International Conventions and/or Marine Classification Society Rules, through a process of independent design review, sample testing and verification of production controls. Although we believe the marine sector has the potential to be a beneficial option for the vessel owners, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C30 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability. 

Capstone&#8217;s C65 Hybrid UPS product line has been evolving over the years. After having received the 2011 NOVA Award from the Construction Innovation Forum for the C65 Hybrid UPS Microturbine at Syracuse University&#8217;s data center&#8212;labeled one of the greenest data centers in the world, Capstone&#8217;s C65 Hybrid UPS system has continued development and has recent installations at Sempra in Monterey Park, California and Capstone&#8217;s own data center in Chatsworth, California. The product utilizes Capstone&#8217;s inverter electronics and controls technology to provide continuous power quality to meet the customer&#8217;s critical load. The load inverter is connected through a central power bus to provide power from one of three available power sources including the utility grid, battery storage system, or microturbine generator. Power to the critical load is synchronized to an available utility grid to allow direct bypass of the critical load to the utility grid. This redundant functionality is provided in a single integrated package that can be scaled to a larger seamless power unit through Capstone&#8217;s multipack feature. These units can also be combined with a heat recovery module or an absorption chiller to provide higher total output efficiency. Unlike current UPS products combined with reciprocating engines for backup, the low emissions Capstone Hybrid UPS product allows for continuous operation year-round allowing customers the ability to receive a payback on their capital equipment investment. Although we believe the industrial UPS market has the potential to be a beneficial option for businesses that require constant supply of reliable energy, we temporarily suspended our development efforts with respect to C65 microturbines targeted at this market in response to lower than expected revenue during Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development after we achieve profitability. 

Capstone is working with the DOE on two next generation technology roadmap programs, including a High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery and advanced AFA (Alumina Forming Austenitic) stainless steel material program in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (&#8220;ORNL&#8221;). The High Efficiency Microturbine with integrated heat recovery is focused on improving microturbine electrical efficiency and overall system efficiency utilizing heat recovery. In March 2013, Capstone successfully completed proof &#8209;of &#8209;concept testing of the low pressure spool also known as the C250 that produced &#62;270 kW as part of the first phase of development. This allowed Capstone to proceed with high pressure spool development which was completed during Fiscal 2016. Capstone also demonstrated an increased capability of the power electronics and electrical system required to support this higher power generator. Management intends to continue with the next phase of development and commercialization after we achieve profitability. The next phase will be to continue development of the C250 product architecture as well as the associated power electronics and software controls required for successful commercialization. The final phase of the program will incorporate further engine efficiency improvements, resulting in a product design with a projected electrical efficiency of 42% and targeted power output of 370 kW. Improvements in efficiency are key to all markets as improved fuel efficiency benefits end users through lower operating costs. AFA stainless steel is a material that offers superior oxidation and creep resistance to commercial heat &#8209;resistant steel alloys used in Capstone microturbines at a significantly reduced cost. In Fiscal 2015, we successfully completed the first of two long term endurance tests and have engaged industry partners on commercialization viability.

Protecting our Intellectual Property Rights and Patents 

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, &#8220;know how&#8221;, and trademark law and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our products. In this regard, we have obtained 102 U.S. and 28 international patents (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). The patents we have obtained will expire between 2016 and 2027. We actively evaluate our patent portfolio and pursue new patent applications as we develop new technological innovations, as needed. 

Management believes that a policy of protecting intellectual property is one component of our strategy of being the leader in microturbine system technology and will provide us with a long term competitive advantage. In addition, we implement security procedures at our plants and facilities and have confidentiality agreements with our suppliers, distributors, employees and certain visitors to our facilities. 

Organization and Employees 

We were organized in 1988. On June 22, 2000, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. 

As of March 31, 2016, we had 191 employees. No employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
