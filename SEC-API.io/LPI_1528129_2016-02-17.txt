 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Laredo is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, and the transportation of oil and natural gas from such properties, primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. We operate and analyze our results of operations through our two principal business segments: 

&#8226; 

Exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties &#32;- conducted principally by Laredo Petroleum, Inc. through the exploration and development of our acreage in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2015 , we had assembled 135,408 &#32;net acres in the Permian Basin and had total proved reserves, presented on a three-stream basis, of 125,698 &#32;MBOE. 

&#8226; 

Midstream and marketing &#32;- conducted principally by our wholly-owned subsidiary, LMS. LMS buys, sells, gathers and transports oil, natural gas and water primarily for the account of Laredo. In addition, LMS owns a 49% &#32;interest in Medallion Gathering &#38; Processing, LLC ("Medallion"), which, upon completion of current projects, will own and operate 500 &#32;miles of pipeline in the Permian Basin. This system gathered, transported and delivered 69,000 Bbls per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Financial information and other disclosures relating to our business segments are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).

Our core assets 

Exploration and production 

The Permian Basin is comprised of several distinct geological provinces, including the Midland Basin to the east, the Delaware Basin to the west and the Central Platform in the middle. Our primary development and production fairway is located on the east side of the Midland Basin, 35 miles east of Midland, Texas. Our acreage is largely contiguous in the neighboring counties of Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, Sterling and Irion, Texas. We refer to this acreage block in this Annual Report as our "Permian-Garden City" area. As of December 31, 2015 , we held 135,408 &#32;net acres in the Permian Basin, with 131,763 &#32;of the net acres held in 250 sections in the Permian-Garden City area, with an average working interest of 95% &#32;in all Laredo-operated producing wells. 

We believe our acreage in the Permian-Garden City area is a resource play for multiple producing formations that partially make up the vertical Wolfberry interval. To date, we have focused the majority of our development activities in four targets for horizontal drilling (Upper, Middle and Lower Wolfcamp and Cline formations), although we have established the existence of additional producing zones, including the Spraberry and Canyon. From our inception in 2006 through December 31, 2015 , we have drilled and completed (i.e., the particular well is flowing) 230 horizontal wells in these initial four identified target zones and 967 vertical wells in the Wolfberry interval. We have completed 97 horizontal Upper Wolfcamp wells, 48 horizontal Middle Wolfcamp wells, 30 horizontal Lower Wolfcamp wells and 55 horizontal Cline wells. 

Beginning in mid-2012, we started focusing our horizontal activity on drilling longer laterals (typically 7,000 to 7,500 feet). Where our contiguous acreage position allows, we have now evolved to drilling 10,000-foot laterals. 

Due to the sharp decline in oil, NGL and natural gas prices that began in the second half of 2014 and continued through 2015 and the beginning of 2016, we reduced our 2016 planned capital program. In connection with the reduced capital program, we have approved a capital budget of $345 million for 2016. Of this budget, $330 million is allocated to our exploration and production segment and $15 million is allocated to our midstream and marketing segment. Substantially all of the planned capital budget is anticipated to be invested in the Permian-Garden City area for both of our segments. Our near-term goal is to concentrate our drilling activities along our previously established production corridors that have the infrastructure in place to allow us the flexibility to most efficiently and economically drill wells at an attractive rate of return, even during the current period of depressed commodity prices. We will also continue to seek cost saving measures to more efficiently deploy our capital, including decreasing our unit lease operating and G&#38;A expenses. We anticipate that in conjunction with the continued downward trend in commodity prices, capital and service costs may continue to decline as well, although there can be no assurance of any such decline. 

In connection with our reduced capital budget, we are decreasing the number of horizontal drilling rigs and eliminating vertical drilling rigs working our properties in the Permian-Garden City area as we do not believe that any vertical drilling is currently necessary under our leases. On December 31, 2015 , we had a total of three operated drilling rigs drilling horizontal wells. Our current drilling schedule anticipates that we will average 2.5 horizontal rigs and no vertical rigs in 2016. 

The timing of drilling our potential locations is influenced by several factors, including commodity prices, capital requirements and availability, the Texas Railroad Commission ("RRC") well-spacing requirements and the continuation of the positive results from our ongoing development drilling program. 

We expect our Permian-Garden City acreage to continue to be the primary driver of our reserves, production and cash flow for the foreseeable future. 

Since our inception, we have established and realized our reserves, production and cash flow primarily through our drilling program coupled with select strategic acquisitions, including our July 2011 acquisition of Broad Oak. Our net proved reserves were estimated at 125,698 &#32;MBOE on a three-stream basis as of December 31, 2015 , of which 80% &#32;are classified as proved developed reserves and 42% &#32;are attributed to oil reserves. For all periods prior to January 1, 2015, our reserves and production were reported in two streams: crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas. This means the economic value of the natural gas liquids in our natural gas was included in the wellhead natural gas price and total volumes on a BOE-basis are lower. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we started reporting our production volumes on a three-stream basis, which separately reports NGL from crude oil and natural gas. In this Annual Report, the information presented with respect to our estimated proved reserves has been prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), our independent reserve engineers, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to the periods presented. 

The following table summarizes our total estimated net proved reserves presented on a three-stream basis, net acreage and producing wells as of December 31, 2015 , and average daily production presented on a three-stream basis for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Based on estimates in the report prepared by Ryder Scott, we operated wells that represent 99% &#32;of the economic value of our proved developed oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 . &#160;

See "&#8212;Our operations&#8212;Estimated proved reserves" for discussion of the prices utilized to estimate our reserves. 

Our net average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was 44,782 &#32;BOE/D, 47% &#32;of which was oil, 26% of which was NGLs and 27% of which was natural gas. 

As discussed previously in this Annual Report, during 2015 commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend has accelerated further into the first quarter of 2016, with crude oil prices reaching a twelve-year low &#32;in February 2016. We have significantly reduced our capital budget for 2016. In addition, we have purposely significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that have historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We have adjusted our long-range five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because given the current economic price environment, coupled with (i) our efforts to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations will be most profitable and (ii) the uncertain effect that such environment will have on the industry&#8217;s access to the capital markets, we believe that we can optimize the value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that may yield the greatest rates of return. 

As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near-term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the potential to provide the greatest economic return and enhance shareholder value, and we have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon our continuing insight as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserve-booking status. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned under very different circumstances as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, we have reduced our booked PUD locations to those we have reasonable certainty to believe that we will develop in at least a two-year time horizon while maintaining the flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as our plans deem appropriate and opportunistic. 

We have built an extensive proprietary technical database that includes 398 in-house, core-calibrated petrophysical logs, 992 square miles of 3D seismic, 44 microseismic surveys, more than 1,090 open and cased-hole logging suites, including 133 dipole sonic logs, 2,866 feet of proprietary whole cores in 13 wells, 859 sidewall cores, 39 single-zone tests and 42 production logs. Our strategic interest in assembling a rich database is directed at efficiently gaining a knowledge base on our resource play in the Permian-Garden City area and maximizing value during the field development phase. 

A key component of our reservoir characterization process is internally referred to as the "Earth Model," which represents a proprietary integrated workflow combining geoscience and engineering data with multivariate statistics. The workflow employed in the Earth Model process differs from the more conventional earth science/engineering approach in that the Earth Model involves parallel workflows, multivariate statistics and significant input from multiple disciplines. The goal of the Earth Model is to develop a predictive three-dimensional model that can forecast production rates through associating empirical subsurface data with proved methods. 

We have been developing the Earth Model process over a period of four years, covering an area where calibrated pre-stack inversion attributes have been extensively developed and tested to determine fundamental controls on reservoir performance. The four major components of the Earth Model are (i) geophysical data (i.e., 3D seismic and micro-seismic surveys), (ii) logs (i.e., conventional open-hole, dipole sonic, and in-house core calibrated petrophysical logs), (iii) cores (both whole and sidewall) and (iv) production history, production logs and single-zone tests. By integrating data that represent mechanical properties, natural fractures, reservoir properties and lithology within a multivariate statistical model, we were generally able to develop a relationship to production with correlation coefficients for our 2016 targeted zones. 

We consider the Earth Model a potentially significant tool in planning development wells in complex geology by optimizing landing points, lateral lengths and geo-steering targets while integrating horizontal and vertical spacing considerations for well laterals. 

We estimate that more than 90% of our horizontal wells to be drilled in 2016 will utilize at least some aspects of the Earth Model, demonstrating evolution from a calibrated backward-looking model into a primary tool for development and delineation well planning. If our preliminary applications of the Earth Model are replicated in forward-looking well planning, we anticipate that the Earth Model may positively impact our ability to increase initial production rates and estimated ultimate recoveries. 

Midstream and marketing 

We are actively involved in seeking midstream solutions for our oil, NGL and natural gas production. Capitalizing on our large acreage blocks, we have built crude oil, natural gas and/or water systems in four production corridors on our Permian-Garden City acreage. These production corridors provide high-pressure centralized natural gas lift systems and crude oil and natural gas gathering, with certain corridors also capable of water delivery, takeaway and recycling (including 77 miles of fresh, produced and recycled water lines). In 2015, we commenced operations at our water treatment facility, which is capable of recycling more than 28,000 Bbls of water per day and has a storage capacity of 1.4 million Bbls. We believe the fact that these production corridors and associated facilities and infrastructure are already in place will enable us to more economically undertake our anticipated 2016 drilling program. 

Additionally, we have built and maintain more than 40 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines to connect Laredo-operated wells in our Permian-Garden City asset, providing a safer and more economic transportation alternative than trucking. We have also installed and maintain 175 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines across our Permian-Garden City acreage, providing us with takeaway optionality that enables us to maintain lower operating pressures and more consistent well performance. 

LMS is a 49% &#32;owner in the Medallion crude oil gathering system which commenced operations in March of 2015. Upon completion of current projects, the system will have 500 &#32;miles of laid pipeline in the following counties in Texas: Mitchell, Howard, Martin, Midland, Glasscock, Reagan, Upton, Crane and Crockett. During the portion of the year in 2015 that it was operational, the system transported 15.2 million &#32;Bbls of crude oil. See Notes 15 and 16.a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of Medallion. 

Our midstream and marketing activities continue to focus on achieving increased efficiencies and cost reductions for (i) the transportation and marketing of our oil and natural gas through the utilization of our oil and natural gas gathering systems to provide access to multiple markets and reduce the potential for production shut-ins caused by downstream capacity issues and (ii) the handling of fresh, recycled and produced water. 

We market the majority of production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in our operated properties. We sell substantially all of our production under contracts ranging from one month to several years, all at market prices. We normally sell production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business; however, we believe that our customer diversification affords us optionality in our sales destination. We have committed a portion of our Permian crude oil production under firm 

transportation agreements, including with Medallion, which agreements will enhance our ability to move our crude oil out of the Permian Basin and give us access to potentially more favorable Gulf Coast pricing. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we were committed to deliver for sale or transportation the following fixed quantities of production under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. &#160;

BOE equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per one Bbl. 

We have firm field transportation agreements that enable us or the purchasers of our oil production to move oil from our production area to the major market hubs of Midland, Texas and Colorado City, Texas. We also have a firm transportation agreement to move oil from Colorado City, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect to fulfill these firm transportation commitments primarily by utilizing the volumes under our firm sales commitments. 

Our production has been equivalent or greater than our delivery commitments during the three most recent years, and we expect such production will continue to exceed our future commitments. However, in certain instances, we have used spot market purchases to meet commitments in certain locations or due to favorable pricing. We anticipate continuing this practice in the future. Also, if our production is not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments, we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments. 

In the current market environment, we believe that we could sell our production to numerous companies so that the loss of any one of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. For information regarding each of our customers that accounted for 10% or more of our oil, NGL and natural gas revenues during the last three calendar years, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results." 

Corporate history and structure 

Laredo Petroleum, Inc. was founded in October 2006 by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Randy Foutch. In 2007, Laredo Petroleum, LLC was formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware by affiliates of Warburg Pincus LLC ("Warburg Pincus"), our institutional investor, and the management of Laredo Petroleum, Inc., to acquire Laredo Petroleum, Inc. and through such subsidiary, to develop and operate oil and natural gas properties in the Permian and Mid-Continent regions of the United States. In August 2011, we incorporated Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"), pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware for purposes of a corporate reorganization and initial public offering ("IPO"). The corporate reorganization, pursuant to which Laredo Petroleum, LLC was merged with and into Holdings, with Holdings surviving the merger, was completed on December 19, 2011 (the "Corporate Reorganization"). In the Corporate Reorganization, all of the outstanding preferred equity interests and certain of the incentive equity interests in Laredo Petroleum, LLC were exchanged for shares of common stock of Holdings. Holdings completed an IPO of its common stock on December 20, 2011. As of December 31, 2015 , Warburg Pincus owned 41.0% &#32;of our common stock. 

On July 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Broad Oak, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laredo Petroleum, Inc. Broad Oak was formed in 2006 with financial support from its management and Warburg Pincus. On July 19, 2011, we changed the name of Broad Oak to Laredo Petroleum-Dallas, Inc. 

On August 1, 2013, we completed the sale of our assets in the Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma (the "Anadarko Basin Sale"), which represented 15% of our proved reserve volumes as of December 31, 2012. 

Effective December 31, 2013, we completed an internal corporate reorganization, which simplified our corporate structure. Our two former subsidiaries, Laredo Petroleum Texas, LLC and Laredo Petroleum-Dallas, Inc. were merged with and into Laredo Petroleum, Inc. The then sole remaining wholly-owned subsidiary of Laredo Petroleum, Inc., formerly known as Laredo Gas Services, LLC, changed its name to Laredo Midstream Services, LLC. Laredo Petroleum, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings, merged with and into Holdings with Holdings surviving and changing its name to "Laredo Petroleum, Inc." We refer to the events described in this paragraph collectively as the "Internal Consolidation." 

On October 24, 2014, GCM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laredo Petroleum, Inc., was formed primarily to hold certain mineral interests owned by the Company. The creation of GCM, the Corporate Reorganization, the IPO and the Internal Consolidation are discussed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Laredo Petroleum, Inc. is the borrower under our Fourth Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility (as amended, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"), as well as the issuer of our $350 million of 6 1/4% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the "March 2023 Notes"), our $500 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "May 2022 Notes") and our $450 million of 5 5/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "January 2022 Notes"). We refer to the March 2023 Notes, the May 2022 Notes and the January 2022 Notes collectively as the "Senior Unsecured Notes." Our subsidiaries, LMS and GCM, are guarantors of the obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes. On April 6, 2015 (the "Redemption Date"), we used the proceeds of the March 2023 Notes offering to fund a portion of the complete redemption of the Company&#8217;s then outstanding $550 million of 9 1/2% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the "January 2019 Notes") at a redemption price of 104.75% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 

Our business strategy 

Our goal is to enhance shareholder value by protecting and potentially growing our reserves, production and cash flow by executing the following strategy: 

Exploration and production 

Proactively manage risk to limit downside 

&#8226; 

We actively attempt to limit our business and operating risks by focusing on safety, flexibility in our financial profile, operation efficiencies, hedging, reducing G&#38;A and developing oil and natural gas takeaway capacity with multiple delivery points. 

Develop our acreage in the most cost-efficient manner possible and target our wells with the highest rate of return potential 

&#8226; 

In the current price environment, we believe the best way to develop our acreage is to take a long-term approach and develop at a deliberate pace that targets our locations with the potential highest rates of return. 

&#8226; 

We believe that our entire acreage position and multiple zones will be a part of our future strategy if prices for commodities rise and/or further cost reductions and technological advances make wells more economic. 

Deploy our capital in a conservative and strategic manner and review opportunities to bolster our liquidity 

&#8226; 

In the current economic environment, maintaining liquidity is critical. Therefore, we will be highly selective in the projects that we fund and will review opportunities to bolster our liquidity and financial position through accessing the capital markets, utilizing our Senior Secured Credit Facility and asset dispositions. 

Continue to hedge our production to protect cash flows and diminish the effects of commodity price fluctuations 

&#8226; 

During 2015, we realized a significant benefit through our hedging program and the certainty that it provided to our cash flow. In the future, we will seek hedging opportunities to further protect our cash flows from commodity price fluctuations. 

Maintain our operational flexibility 

&#8226; 

As reflected in our December 31, 2015 &#32;reserves, we deliberately reduced our PUD bookings. While this decision impacts our booked reserves on a current basis, we also believe that it provides us with the crucial flexibility necessary to allow us to alter our drilling plans as may be necessary to develop our highest rate of return properties to benefit our shareholders. 

Evaluate and pursue value-enhancing acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and divestitures 

&#8226; 

We will continue to monitor the market for strategic acquisitions that we believe could be accretive and enhance shareholder value. However, as a result of our past years of data collection and delineation drilling, we have established the production capability of a substantial portion of our acreage in multiple zones, which provides us with a significant drilling inventory even at the current depressed commodity prices. 

Capitalize on technical expertise and database 

&#8226; 

We will continue to leverage our operating and technical expertise to further delineate and develop our core acreage positions. We believe the development and use of the Earth Model will enable us to better identify the best locations and drill them more efficiently, thereby capturing more hydrocarbons than would otherwise be possible. 

Midstream and marketing 

Expand the use of our previously built infrastructure and look for opportunities for strategic expansion 

&#8226; 

We believe that our infrastructure provides us with optionality and efficiencies in developing and transporting production from our Permian-Garden City acreage position. Because of the value we ascribe to this infrastructure, we will continue to look for strategic expansion opportunities while maintaining our core strategy of providing marketing optionality for our oil, NGL and natural gas production. 

Participate in the growth and expansion of Medallion 

&#8226; 

We believe the Medallion pipeline is a valuable and unique asset in our area of operations that provides benefit to us both in terms of transporting our production and financially through our 49% &#32;ownership. We will continue to closely monitor all proposed expansions and participate in those that we feel will be beneficial to our shareholders. 

Our competitive strengths 

We have a number of competitive strengths in each of our segments that we believe will assist in the successful execution of our business strategy. 

Exploration and production 

Extensive Permian technical database and expertise &#32; 

&#8226; 

We have made a substantial upfront investment to understand the geology, geophysics and reservoir parameters of the rock formations and production characteristics that define our drilling and development program. We have utilized this information in the creation of the Earth Model, which we believe will assist us in optimizing our well results. 

Contiguous acreage position that contains multiple zones with a substantial drilling inventory &#32; 

&#8226; 

We have 131,763 &#32;net acres in the Permian-Garden City area that are largely contiguous, have identified at least seven zones from which we can produce and have a significant drilling inventory even at the current depressed commodity prices. Our contiguous acreage position also allows us to drill long laterals (10,000 feet or greater) in many locations, 

which we estimate will provide an even greater rate of return as we continue to refine our spacing, drilling and completion techniques. 

Significant operational control &#32; 

&#8226; 

We operate wells that represent 99% &#32;of the economic value of our proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2015 , based on our reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. We believe that maintaining operating control permits us to better pursue our strategy of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing cost-efficient ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries through reservoir analysis and evaluation and continuous improvement of drilling, completion and stimulation techniques. We expect to maintain operating control over most of our potential drilling locations. 

Significant hedges in place to guard against price volatility 

&#8226; 

We engage in an active hedging program in an effort to decrease the volatility of our cash flow due to changes in commodity prices. We currently have hedges in place for oil that represent 85% to 90% &#32;of anticipated oil sales in 2016 with a weighted-average floor price of $70.84 &#32;per Bbl, and hedges in place for natural gas that represent 70% to 75% &#32;of anticipated natural gas sales in 2016 with a weighted-average floor price of $3.00 &#32;per MMBtu. For 2017, we have hedges in place for 2,628,000 &#32;barrels of oil with a weighted-average floor price of $77.22 &#32;per Bbl and hedges for natural gas for 13,515,000 &#32;MMBtu with a weighted-average floor price of $2.70 &#32;per MMBtu. For 2018, we have hedges in place for natural gas for 8,220,000 &#32;MMBtu with a weighted-average floor price of $2.50 &#32;per MMBtu. We believe that the price certainty associated with these hedges enables us to better plan and forecast our upcoming capital and operational spending. 

Strong corporate governance and institutional investor support 

&#8226; 

Our board of directors is well qualified and represents a meaningful resource to our management team. Our board of directors, which is comprised of representatives of Warburg Pincus, other independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive oil and natural gas industry and general business expertise. We actively engage our board of directors, on a regular basis, for their expertise on strategic, financial, governance and risk management activities. In addition, Warburg Pincus has many years of relevant experience in financing and supporting exploration and production companies and management teams. During the last two decades, Warburg Pincus has been the lead investor in many such companies, including Broad Oak and two previous companies operated by members of our management team. 

Midstream and marketing 

Owned gathering infrastructure 

&#8226; 

We own and operate more than 200 miles of pipeline in our crude oil and natural gas gathering systems in the Permian Basin as of December 31, 2015 . Additionally, through our joint venture with Medallion, upon completion of current projects we will have access to 500 &#32;miles of oil gathering systems and pipelines connected to Colorado City, Texas. As a 49% &#32;owner of Medallion, we financially benefit from our share of the net income from the shipment of crude oil on the system. These systems and pipelines provide greater operational efficiency and potentially lower price differentials for our production and enable us to coordinate our activities to connect our wells to market upon completion with minimal pipeline delays. 

Our production corridors allow us to more efficiently develop our acreage and utilize/dispose of water 

&#8226; 

We have built production corridors on our contiguous acreage position that we believe increase efficiencies in oil and natural gas takeaway capacity, water supply and field level operations. We believe that our production corridors provide us with identified areas within which we can achieve material cost savings and efficiencies through the use of our previously built infrastructure. In addition, we believe that drilling wells within these corridors increases our production consistency and allows us to better plan our development program. 

&#8226; 

The use and disposal of water is one of the most challenging aspects of horizontal drilling in the Permian Basin and our production corridors provide us with a reliable and consistent means to ensure that we have the water we need to complete our wells while also providing take away capacity for flowback and produced water. 

&#8226; 

Our water treatment facility allows us to more sustainably utilize recycled flowback and produced water in our completion operations and reduce our capital and operating expenses for water supply and disposal. 

Other properties 

In addition to our Permian-Garden City acreage, as of December 31, 2015 &#32;we held 21,257 net acres in other areas, including the Palo Duro Basin and Permian-China Grove area. We anticipate little or no activity on these other properties in 2016. Approximately 29% of this acreage will expire in 2016, absent drilling or renegotiation of the applicable leases. 

Our operations 

Estimated proved reserves 

Our reserves are reported in three streams: crude oil, NGL and natural gas. In this Annual Report, the information with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared by Ryder Scott, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to the periods presented. 

Per SEC guidelines, companies are required to use the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period before differentials ("Benchmark Prices"). The Benchmark Prices are then adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead ("Realized Prices"). The Realized Prices are held constant and utilized to calculate estimated reserves and the associated future cash flows. The following table presents the Benchmark Prices and Realized Prices as of the periods presented. &#160;

For periods prior to January 1, 2015, the Company presented reserves for oil and natural gas, which combined NGL with the natural gas stream, and did not separately report NGL. This change impacts the comparability of 2015 with prior periods. 

Our net proved reserves were estimated at 125,698 MBOE on a three-stream basis as of December 31, 2015 , of which 80% &#32;were classified as proved developed reserves and 42% &#32;are attributable to oil reserves. The following table presents summary data for our core operating area as of December 31, 2015 . Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;assume our ability to fund the capital costs necessary for their development and are affected by pricing assumptions. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. Decreases in commodity prices, or negative revisions to reserve estimates or assumptions as to future oil, NGL and natural gas prices, may lead to decreased earnings, losses or impairment of oil and natural gas assets." &#160;

Technology used to establish proved reserves 

Under the SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible within five years from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, NGL and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, open-hole logs, core analyses, geologic maps, available downhole and production data and seismic data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves, material balance calculations or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated primarily by performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and the use of geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques. 

As discussed previously in this Annual Report, during 2015 commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend has accelerated further into the first quarter of 2016, with crude oil prices reaching a twelve-year low in February 2016. We have significantly reduced our capital budget for 2016. In addition, we have purposely significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that have historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We have adjusted our long-range five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because given the current economic price environment, coupled with (i) our efforts to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations will be most profitable and (ii) the uncertain effect that such environment will have on the industry&#8217;s access to the capital markets, we believe that we can optimize the value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that may yield the greatest rates of return. 

As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near-term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the potential to provide the greatest economic return and enhance shareholder value, and we have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon our continuing insight as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserve-booking status. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned under very different circumstances as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, we have reduced our booked PUD locations to those we have reasonable certainty to believe that we will develop in at least a two-year time horizon while maintaining the flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as our plans deem appropriate and opportunistic. 

Qualifications of technical persons and internal controls over reserves estimation process 

In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and guidelines established by the SEC, Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, estimated 100% of our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;included in this Annual Report. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 

We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott's preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. The Ryder Scott reserve report is reviewed with representatives of Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. Additionally, our senior management reviews the Ryder Scott reserve report. 

Our Vice President of Reservoir Modeling and Field Development Planning, is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. He has more than 40 years of practical experience with 32 years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He has a Bachelors of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and is a life member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Our Vice President of Reservoir Modeling and Field Development Planning reports directly to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior engineering staff, other members of senior management and our technical staff, our audit committee and our Chief Executive Officer and then submitted to our board of directors for final approval. 

Proved undeveloped reserves 

Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased from 141,765 &#32;MBOE, reported on a two-stream basis, as of December 31, 2014 , to 25,303 &#32;MBOE, reported on a three-stream basis, as of December 31, 2015 . We estimate that we incurred $162 million of costs to convert 10,563 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from 37 locations into proved developed reserves in 2015 . New proved undeveloped reserves of 2,669 &#32;MBOE were added during the year from four &#32;new horizontal Middle Wolfcamp locations. Negative revisions to proved undeveloped reserves of 106,883 &#32;MBOE were due to the combined effect of our adjusted booking methodology with the removal of 378 &#32;proved undeveloped locations and the net effect of reinterpreting 34 &#32;undeveloped locations. The 378 &#32;locations that were removed were comprised of 182 &#32;vertical Wolfberry wells due to lower commodity prices and 196 &#32;horizontal wells to better align the timing of their development with our future drilling plans. In addition, 1,685 MBOE were removed due to the sale of nine undeveloped locations in August 2015. 

Estimated total future development and abandonment costs related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves as shown in our December 31, 2015 &#32;reserve report are $266 million. Based on this report, the capital estimated to be spent in 2016 and 2017 to develop the proved undeveloped reserves is $192 million and $74 million, respectively, and $0 for each of 

2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on our anticipated cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the availability of capital markets transactions, all of the proved undeveloped locations are expected to be drilled within a two-year period. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, oilfield service costs, technology, acreage position and availability and other economic factors may lead to changes in development plans. 

Sales volume, revenues and price history

All but two of our wells are classified as oil wells, all of which also produce liquids-rich natural gas and condensate. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to the predominant production stream. We also own royalty and overriding royalty interests in a small number of wells in which we do not own a working interest. &#160;

Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as expiring over the next four years, 40 net acres have associated PUD reserves, which we anticipate drilling to hold the associated leases. These PUD reserves represent an insignificant amount of our overall PUD reserves. 

Of the 3,165 net acres of leasehold that were identified at December 31, 2014 as attributable to PUD reserves and potentially expiring, 80 net acres actually expired in 2015. As of December 31, 2015 , the locations from those expired acres were no longer classified as PUD reserves. The remainder of such acreage was retained either through lease extensions or drilling. 

Drilling activity 

The following table summarizes our drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells.

Title to properties 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under oil and gas leases or net profits interests. 

Oil and natural gas leases 

The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other 

leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 87.5%. As of December 31, 2015 , 70% &#32;of all of our net leasehold acreage was held by production and 81% &#32;of our Permian-Garden City acreage was held by production. 

Seasonality 

Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations. 

Competition 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with a wide range of companies in our industry, including those that have greater resources than we do and those that are smaller with fewer ongoing obligations. Many of the larger companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Many of the smaller companies have a lower cost structure and more liquidity. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory locations or evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration and production activities during periods of low market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because of the inherent advantages of some of our competitors, those companies may have an advantage in bidding for exploratory and producing properties. 

Hydraulic fracturing 

We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process for our producing properties in Texas because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. We are currently conducting hydraulic fracturing activity in the completion of both our vertical and horizontal wells in the Permian Basin. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain any of our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved developed non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling, recompletion and refracture stimulation projects require hydraulic fracturing. 

We have and continue to follow standard industry practices and applicable legal requirements. State and federal regulators impose requirements on our operations designed to ensure protection of human health and the environment. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones, and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. It is believed that this well design effectively eliminates a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval. 

Injection rates and pressures are monitored instantaneously and in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations would be shut down immediately if an abrupt change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure. 

Certain state regulations require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. In accordance with Texas regulations, we report the constituents of the hydraulic fracturing fluids utilized in our well completions on FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org). Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it by recycling or by discharging into approved disposal wells, so as to minimize the potential for impact to nearby surface water. 

We currently do not discharge water to the surface. Based upon results of testing the performance of recycled flowback/produced water in our fracing operations on a limited number of wells, we have constructed and operate a water recycle facility on one of our production corridors and anticipate expanding our recycling activities in the future. 

For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please read "-Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters-Water and other waste discharges and spills." For related risks to our stockholders, please read "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to our business&#8212;Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could prohibit projects or result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays because of the significance of hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells in our business." 

Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 

Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. The state of Texas has statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the pooling of crude oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. 

Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. 

We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered, and such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance. 

Regulation of production of oil and natural gas 

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The State of Texas has regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the pooling of oil and natural gas properties, including the permitting of allocation wells, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction. Texas further regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. State laws also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled, pooling of oil and natural gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells. Texas further has the power to prorate production to the market demand for oil and natural gas. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 

Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures, the noncompliance with which carries substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations to remediate noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion and production process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of "fault" is required) that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements, our business and prospects, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general, could be materially adversely affected. 

Hazardous substance and waste handling 

Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed "responsible parties." These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Despite the "petroleum exclusion" of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. Finally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on "responsible parties" for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. Although 

RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is also possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes." Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 

Water and other waste discharges and spills 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), the OPA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. The State of Texas also maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. &#32; The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 

Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the "UIC"). However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC. Under this assertion of authority, the EPA requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations, specifically in Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil and natural gas production activities. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the SDWA, prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a UIC permit. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program permitting guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how Class II regulations may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of this permit guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. 

In addition, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the disclosure of information related to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014. The EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by December 2016, which would describe a proposed mechanism-regulatory, 

voluntary or a combination of both-to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Moreover, the EPA is examining regulatory requirements for "indirect dischargers" of wastewater (i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters). On April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works ("POTWs"). The EPA asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt POTW operations and/or be discharged, untreated, from the POTW to receiving waters. If adopted, the new pre-treatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to POTWs. The public comment period ended on July 17, 2015, and the EPA is expected to publish a final rule by August 2016. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. We cannot predict the impact that these standards may have on our business at this time, but these standards could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Also, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. The rule took effect on June 24, 2015, although it is the subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups and at least four states, alleging that federal law does not give the BLM authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction preventing the BLM from implementing the rule nationwide. This order has been appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment, finding that, while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources, there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism. 

Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, beginning February 1, 2012, companies were required to disclose to the RRC and the public the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. 

If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well 

as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law. 

Air emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. In August 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). The rule includes NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds ("VOC") emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA &#32;h as issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration. For example, in September 2013 and December 2014, the EPA amended its rules to extend compliance deadlines and to clarify the NSPS. Further, on July 31, 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the NSPS to address the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel). In addition, on September 18, 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules to reduce methane and VOC emissions from the oil and gas industry, including new "downstream" requirements covering equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry that was not regulated by the 2012 rules. The public comment period closed on December 4, 2015. Also, on January 22, 2016, the BLM announced a proposed rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The proposed rule would require operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule would also clarify when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. 

We have incurred additional capital expenditures to insure compliance with these new regulations as they come into effect. We may also be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations. 

Regulation of "greenhouse gas" emissions 

Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs, although in recent years some states have scaled back their commitment to GHG initiatives. Most cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. 

In addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regarding possible 

future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule (or the "tailoring rule") in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA &#32;(" UARG v. EPA" ), the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to the Court's decision in UARG v. EPA . In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicated it would promulgate a rule to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted "no action assurance" indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. 

In September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including NGL fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. 

The EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen States as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan pending disposition of the legal challenges. Nevertheless, as a result of the continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. 

In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties ("COP-21") of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. 

Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 

Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. 

However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. 

Occupational Safety and Health Act 

We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements. 

National Environmental Policy Act 

Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects. 

Endangered Species Act 

The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We conduct operations on federal oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species, such as the lesser prairie chicken, that are listed as threatened or endangered and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could adversely impact the value of our leases. 

Summary 

In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

Disclosures required pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 

Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) knowingly engaged in certain specified activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities targeted by United States' economic sanctions during the period covered by the report. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Neither we nor any of our controlled affiliates or subsidiaries knowingly engaged in any of the specified activities relating to Iran or otherwise engaged in any activities associated with Iran during the reporting period. However, because the SEC defines the term "affiliate" broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controlled us or is under common control with us. 

The description of the activities below has been provided to us by Warburg Pincus, affiliates of which: (i) beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and are members of our board of directors and (ii) beneficially own more than 10% of the equity interests of, and have the right to designate members of the board of directors of, Endurance International Group ("Endurance") and Santander Asset Management Investment Holdings Limited ("SAMIH"). Endurance 

and SAMIH may therefore be deemed to be under "common control" with us; however, this statement is not meant to be an admission that common control exists. 

The disclosure below relates solely to activities conducted by Endurance and SAMIH and their respective affiliates. The disclosure does not relate to any activities conducted by Laredo or by Warburg Pincus and does not involve our or Warburg Pincus' management. Neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus had any involvement in or control over the disclosed activities of Endurance or SAMIH, and neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus has independently verified or participated in the preparation of the disclosure. Neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus is representing as to the accuracy or completeness of the disclosure nor do we or Warburg Pincus undertake any obligation to correct or update it. 

As to SAMIH: 

Laredo understands that SAMIH's affiliates intend to disclose in their next annual or quarterly SEC report that: 

"Santander UK plc ("Santander UK") holds frozen savings accounts and one current account for two customers resident in the U.K. who are currently designated by the U.S. for terrorism. The accounts held by each customer were blocked after the customer's designation and remained blocked and dormant throughout 2015. Revenue generated by Santander UK on these accounts is negligible. 

An Iranian national, resident in the U.K., who is currently designated by the U.S. under the Iranian Financial Sanctions Regulations and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations ("NPWMD sanctions program"), holds a mortgage with Santander UK that was issued prior to any such designation. No further drawdown has been made (or would be permitted) under this mortgage although Santander UK continues to receive repayment installments. In 2015, total revenue in connection with the mortgage was approximately &#163;3,876 and net profits were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander UK. The same Iranian national also holds two investment accounts with Santander Asset Management UK Limited. The funds within both accounts are invested in the same portfolio fund. The accounts have remained frozen during 2015. The investment returns are being automatically reinvested, and no disbursements have been made to the customer. Total revenue for the Santander Group in connection with the investment accounts was &#163;188 and net profits in 2015 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Banco Santander, S.A. 

During the third quarter 2015, two additional Santander UK customers were designated. First, a U.K. national designated by the U.S. under the Specially Designated Global Terrrorist ("SDGT") sanctions program who is on the U.S. Specially Designated National ("SDN") list. This customer holds a bank account which generated revenue of approximately &#163;180 during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. The account is blocked. Net profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Santander. Second, a U.K. national also designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program who is on the U.S. SDN list, held a bank account. No transactions were made in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 and the account is blocked and in arrears. 

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Santander UK has identified one additional customer. A U.K. national designated by the U.S. under the SDGT sanctions program who is on the U.S. SDN list, held a bank account which generated negligible revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015. The account was closed during the fourth quarter of 2015. Net profits in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negligible relative to the overall profits of Banco Santander, S.A." 

As to Endurance: 

Laredo understands that Endurance's affiliates intend to disclose in their next annual or quarterly SEC report that: 

"On December 2, 2015, Endurance terminated a subscriber account ("the Subscriber Account") that Endurance believes to be associated with Issam Shammout and Sky Blue Bird Aviation ("Shammout") identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), as a Specially Designated National, or ("SDN"), on May 21, 215, pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Part 594. The Subscriber Account was inadvertently migrated to Endurance's servers following its acquisition of the assets of Arvixe LLC ("Arvixe") on October 31, 2014. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement between Endurance and Arvixe, any customer accounts prohibited by OFAC were expressly excluded from the acquisition. Accordingly, Endurance does not believe it took legal ownership of the Subscriber Account, and no revenue was collected by Endurance in connection with the Subscriber Account since the date on which Shammout was added to the SDN list. Nonetheless, upon identifying that the Subscriber Account had been migrated to its servers, Endurance promptly suspended all services and terminated the Subscriber Account. Endurance reported the Subscriber Account to OFAC as potentially the property of a SDN subject to blocking pursuant to Executive Order 13223. As of January 25, 2016, Endurance has not received any correspondence from OFAC regarding this matter."
