Description of the Company&#39;s Business 

&#160; 

Gyrodyne, LLC (&#8220;Gyrodyne&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Registrant&#8221;) is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of New York whose primary business is the investment in and the acquisition, ownership and management of a geographically diverse portfolio of medical office, industrial and development of industrial and residential properties located in the Northeast region of the United States. The Company manages its business as one operating segment. 

&#160; 

Until December 2013, the Company&#8217;s properties had previously been owned and managed by Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;), whose primary business until then was the investment in and the acquisition, ownership and management of a geographically diverse portfolio of medical office, industrial and development of industrial and residential properties located in the Northeast region of the United States. In December 2013, the Corporation transferred all of its properties to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC (&#8220;GSD&#8221;), subject to related mortgage debt in favor of Flowerfield Mortgage, Inc., (&#8220;FMI&#8221;) also a subsidiary of the Corporation, and then distributed to its shareholders, as the non-cash portion of the special dividend announced on September 12, 2013 (the &#8220; First Special Dividend&#8221;), all of the equity interests of GSD. Based on management provisions set forth in GSD&#8217;s limited liability company agreement which designated sole management authority to the Corporation, the Corporation concluded that GSD was a variable interest entity and that GSD&#8217;s financial statements should be consolidated with the Corporation&#8217;s. On August 31, 2015, the Corporation and GSD were merged with and into the Company which completes the tax liquidation of the Corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Following the December 30, 2013 distribution of all of the equity interests of GSD to the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders in the First Special Dividend, the Corporation was managing GSD pursuant to the terms of GSD&#8217;s limited liability company agreement which provided that the Corporation had sole and absolute discretion regarding the management and affairs of GSD. In its capacity as GSD&#8217;s managing member, the Corporation had unilateral authority, without seeking GSD shareholder approval, over the management of the real estate assets, including leasing and sale of its real estate holdings and the execution of any agency and brokerage agreements to facilitate such leases and sales, investing in its real estate holdings through capital improvements and proceeding strategically to maximize the value of the undeveloped Flowerfield property. Under GSD&#8217;s limited liability company agreement, the Corporation was entitled to market-rate compensation for its services as well as reimbursement for any costs and expenses incurred by and properly allocable to GSD. In April 2014, the Corporation&#8217;s Board approved a full cost mark-up based management fee to be charged to GSD equal to reimbursement of expenses plus a mark-up of 8.5%, which percentage fell in the lower quartile of similar fees charged by comparable companies according to a benchmarking study. In connection with such management services, the Corporation was obligated to provide an initial liquidity facility to GSD in an amount not to exceed $2.5 million. The Board subsequently authorized increases in the revolving line of credit to $7.0 million. The interest income on the debt facilities provided to GSD was REIT qualified income. The foregoing income earned by the Corporation for managing GSD was not deemed to be REIT qualified income and therefore was appropriately payable to its taxable REIT subsidiary, Flowerfield Properties, Inc. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Following the Merger, but prior to the sale of one property in the Port Jefferson Professional Park in December 2015, the Company continues to own two medical office parks and ten of fourteen buildings in a third medical office park, together comprising approximately 131,000 rentable square feet and a multitenant industrial park comprising approximately 130,000 rentable square feet. In conjunction with the industrial Park, the Company owns approximately 68 acres of property in St. James, New York. 

&#160; 

Prior to the Merger, the Corporation operated as a REIT under Section 856(c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As a REIT, the Corporation generally was not subject to federal and state income tax provided that it made distributions to its shareholders equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as defined under the Code. The Corporation was permitted to participate in certain activities from which it was previously precluded in order to maintain its qualifications as a REIT. However these activities were required to be conducted in an entity that elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) under the Code. The Corporation had one TRS which was subject to federal and state income tax on the income from these activities. 

&#160; 

Prior to the Merger, the Corporation conducted its operations either directly or indirectly through (1) property owning subsidiaries and a lender subsidiary, or (2) Flowerfield Properties, Inc. a wholly-owned TRS. Property owner subsidiaries are landlords leasing properties in which the Corporation had a managing member control but no ownership interest, and a lender subsidiary is a lender loaning funds where the Corporation made an investment in a loan asset, but in all cases these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. The Corporation was the sole managing member of GSD with managerial authority and investment/disposition authority. FMI was a lender subsidiary wholly-owned by the Corporation with three loan assets secured by property held in the property owner subsidiaries. Following the Merger, each property continued to reside in separate single asset LLC&#8217;s wholly-owned and controlled by the Company. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company has a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery Judge Grove, L.P. (the &#8220;Grove&#8221;), a limited partnership, which in September 2013 sold its only asset, an undeveloped Florida property, the &#8220;Grove Property&#8221;. Gyrodyne did not receive any distribution in connection with the sale. Under the agreement with the purchaser, the Grove may receive additional payments if certain development benchmarks are achieved by the purchaser, which could enable future distributions to Gyrodyne. Gyrodyne cannot predict whether these benchmarks will be achieved or as to the timing or amount of any further distributions by the Grove. 

&#160; 

The purchaser of the Grove Property, Minto Group, formally refers to the development project as Westlake. In October 2014, Westlake was approved by the Palm Beach County Commission to develop 4,546 homes, 2.1 million square feet of commercial development, a 3,000-student university and a 150-unit hotel. Minto Group announced on February 18, 2016 that groundbreaking for Westlake could take place in as early as 90 days and that residential sales were expected to begin in early 2017. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the original sale agreement for the Grove Property and given the status of development and sales, Gyrodyne does not expect distributions to the partnership, if any, until 2017 at the earliest. The amount of distributions, if any, ultimately received by Gyrodyne will depend on The Grove&#8217;s receipts from Westlake and the liabilities and expenses of the Grove that must be settled prior to any distributions to Gyrodyne. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our properties are subject to net leases in which the tenant reimburses the Company (GSD, prior to the Merger) for a portion, all of or substantially all of the costs and/ or cost increases for utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and real estate taxes. Certain leases provide that the Company is responsible for specific operating costs. 

&#160; 

Strategic Process 

&#160; 

In July 2012, the Corporation received $167,501,657 from the State of New York in payment of the judgments in the Corporation&#8217;s favor in its condemnation litigation with the State, which consisted of $98,685,000 in additional damages, $1,474,941 in costs, disbursements and expenses and $67,341,716 in interest. In August 2012, the Corporation announced that it was undertaking a strategic review to maximize shareholder value through one or more potential cash distributions and/or through a potential sale, merger, reinvestment or other strategic combination, consistent with the Corporation&#8217;s previously announced goal of providing one or more tax efficient liquidity events to its shareholders. 

&#160; 

On September 12, 2013, following the Corporation&#8217;s receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;2013 PLR&#8221;) (as described below), the Board concluded that it was in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to liquidate the Corporation for federal income tax purposes and adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the &#8220;Plan of Liquidation&#8221;). In adopting the Plan of Liquidation for federal income tax purposes, the Board also determined to pursue the actual disposition of our remaining assets in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets. The completion of the Merger on or before September 12, 2015 would complete the liquidation of the Corporation for federal income tax purposes within the two year period from the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, as provided by Section 562(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) even though the actual disposition of the properties within the same period had not necessarily occurred. The Corporation&#8217;s directors believed that the prompt completion of the tax liquidation by means of the Merger while permitting a longer period to dispose of the remaining assets would help obtain better values by enabling the sales to take place without the potential timing constraints created by completing the Merger as promptly as practicable. In addition, the ability to extend the time of holding the properties would make it possible to seek enhancements to the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor, including the pursuit of various development or zoning opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On September 13, 2013, the Corporation&#8217;s Board declared the First Special Dividend, in the amount of $98,685,000, or $66.56 per share, of which approximately $68,000,000, or $45.86 per share, was to be paid in cash. In connection with the First Special Dividend, the Board requested the opinion of Valuation Research Corporation (&#8220;Valuation Research&#8221;) as to the solvency of the Corporation after giving effect to the First Special Dividend. On September 13, 2013, at a meeting of the Board, Valuation Research delivered its opinion that, immediately after the completion of the First Special Dividend, (i) the fair value and the present fair saleable value of the Corporation&#8217;s aggregate assets exceeded the sum of its total liabilities, (ii) Corporation would be able to pay its debts as such debts mature or otherwise become absolute or due, and (iii) the Corporation did not have unreasonably small capital. 

&#160; 

On December 19, 2013, the Board determined that the non-cash portion of the First Special Dividend would be paid by a distribution of all of the outstanding interests in GSD, a subsidiary of the Corporation into which all of the Corporation&#8217;s real estate assets were previously contributed as part of an internal restructuring. We refer to such properties as the Contributed Properties. The Board also determined the aggregate value of the outstanding equity interests of GSD (&#8220;GSD Interests&#8221;) distributed in the First Special Dividend was $30,685,000 (an amount determined by the Board to be equal to the estimated fair market value of the properties, net of all liabilities encumbering such properties, including mortgage loans payable to a subsidiary of the Corporation in the aggregate amount of $13,840,889 as of December 31, 2013). 

&#160; 

The First Special Dividend was paid on December 30, 2013 to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2013. As required by NASDAQ rules governing special dividends of this magnitude, the ex-dividend date was set one business day following the payment date. 

&#160; 

The transfer of the Contributed Properties by the Corporation to GSD resulted in the recognition of approximately $28.4 million of capital gain income by the Corporation in 2013. Giving effect to offsetting deductions, the Corporation determined that it would have approximately $18 million in REIT income for 2013. In order to satisfy applicable REIT distribution requirements, on December 20, 2013, the Corporation declared an additional dividend (the &#8220;Second Special Dividend&#8221;), payable to the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders of record as of December 31, 2013 on January 31, 2014. The Second Special Dividend was paid in the form of uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note due June 30, 2017 (the &#8220;Dividend Note&#8221;) aggregating $16,150,000 ($10.89 per share) in principal amount. The Dividend Note carried interest at 5.0% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2014, and was to be paid in cash or in the form of additional notes. On June 16, 2014, the initial semi-annual interest payment on the Dividend Note was paid in kind in the form of uncertificated interests in a 5% subordinated global note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $302,813 that otherwise was identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. On December 15, 2014 and June 15, 2015, the second and third semi-annual interest payments on the original Dividend Note were paid in kind in the form of uncertificated interests in subordinated global 5% notes due June 30, 2017 in the principal amounts of $403,750 each, that otherwise were identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. The initial interest due of $7,570 on the note issued on June 16, 2014 was paid in cash on December 15, 2014. On June 15, 2015, the second interest payment of $7,570 was made in cash on the interest note issued June 16, 2014. Also on June 15, 2015 the initial interest payments were made in cash in the amounts of $15,630 and $10,094 on the Dividend Note issued December 31, 2014 and the second interest note issued December 15, 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

In addition, on September 15, 2014, the Corporation&#8217;s Board declared a special supplemental dividend in the amount of $682,033 (approximately $0.46 per share), the remaining undistributed balance of the 2013 taxable income, paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note issued on December 31, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2014 (the &#8220;2014 Dividend Note&#8221;, and together with the Dividend Note, the &#8220;Dividend Notes&#8221;). With the exception of the face value of the note and the dates of the initial interest payment, all terms and conditions mirrored the terms and conditions of the notes previously issued. 

&#160; 

Rights Offering. On March 6, 2015, the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) for a rights offering to the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders. The Corporation&#8217;s Board believed that the rights offering would facilitate the vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares needed under New York law to approve the proposed Merger. Given the small size of holdings of many shareholders of the Corporation and the nature of various holders, the Corporation believed many holders may not have paid enough attention to the Merger to exercise their right to vote during 2014. The Board believed that shareholders who exercised their subscription rights in the rights offering were more likely to vote their shares on the Merger proposal. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On April 27, 2015, the Corporation announced that it had set May 6, 2015 as the record date for its previously announced rights offering, and that the subscription price for the rights offering would be $2.75 per share. In the rights offering, the Corporation distributed, at no charge, to shareholders as of the record date non-transferable subscription rights to purchase, on a three-for-two basis, up to an aggregate of 2,224,020 shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock. 

&#160; 

On May 18, 2015, the SEC declared the registration statement effective, and on May 19, 2015, the Corporation announced the commencement of the rights offering. The Corporation effected the rights offering through the distribution of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase shares of its common stock at $2.75 per share subject to certain aggregate ownership limitations. In the rights offering, shareholders received three subscription rights for each two shares of common stock held of record on May 6, 2015, with each subscription right giving a shareholder the right to purchase one share of common stock. The rights offering also included an over-subscription privilege, which entitled each rights holder that exercised its basic subscription privilege in full, the right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering, subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising this over-subscription right. The rights offering did not contain an overallotment option. 

&#160; 

On June 17, 2015, the Corporation closed the rights offering and on June 22, 2015 the Corporation announced that it received subscriptions for approximately 7,044,894 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 2,224,020. Shareholders were allocated 100% of their basic subscriptions. Based on the maximum 2,224,020 shares that were issuable in the rights offering, 1,214,644 shares were allocated to shareholders who properly exercised their oversubscription privilege, pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of shares subscribed for under the over-subscription privilege, or 20.12499% of each over-subscriber&#8217;s requested shares. The rights offering resulted in 2,224,020 common shares issued on June 26, 2015 and net proceeds received (after expenses) of $5,606,190 (Gross proceeds of $6,116,055 less direct expenses of the rights offering of $509,865). 

&#160; 

Merger Allocations . The Plan of Merger originally provided for an allocation of Gyrodyne LLC interests to be issued in the Merger of 15.2% to shareholders of the Corporation, 29.2% to the holders of the Dividend Notes and 55.6% to the holders of common interests of GSD (collectively, the &#8220;Initial Allocations&#8221;). The Plan of Merger as revised by the December 2013 amendment provided that each of the Initial Allocations set forth therein of Gyrodyne, LLC interests to be issued in the Merger in exchange for common shares of the Corporation, GSD Interests and interests in the Notes would be subject to adjustment in the discretion of the Corporation&#8217;s Board. The Plan of Merger provided that any changes made to the Initial Allocations would be announced at least ten days prior to the meeting of shareholders at which shareholders of the Corporation would be asked to consider and vote upon the Plan of Merger. 

&#160; 

At a meeting held on April 24, 2015, the Corporation&#8217;s Board determined to adjust the allocation of common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC to be issued pursuant to the Merger to account for certain developments subsequent to December 2013. As adjusted, the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC issued in the Merger were allocated as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 22.6% in the aggregate to shareholders of the Corporation; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 30.0% in the aggregate to holders of interests in notes issued by the Corporation in the aggregate principal amount of $17,937,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 47.4% in the aggregate to holders of common interests of GSD. 

&#160; 

The allocations reflected adjusted net book value, face value and &#8220;fair value&#8221; (based on appraised values of underlying properties owned by GSD, less liabilities) of the Corporation, the Notes and GSD, respectively, in each case as of December 31, 2014. In addition, the Board determined the foregoing allocation adjustments based on the increase in the adjusted net book value of its shares due to the rights offering and the anticipated net proceeds to the Corporation of $5,606,000 from the rights offering (actual net proceeds were $5,606,190), assuming all 2,224,020 shares were sold. This methodology was consistent with the valuation metrics used to determine the original allocations in December, 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Following the completion of the rights offering on June 17, 2015, the Corporation&#8217;s Board established June 29, 2015 as the record date for determining shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting which would take place on August 20, 2015. On July 1, 2015, the Corporation filed a supplement to the proxy statement/prospectus dated July 1, 2014 to provide supplemental information to the proxy statement prospectus. On August 17, 2015, the Corporation filed supplement number 2 to the proxy statement/prospectus dated July 1, 2014 to provide supplemental information regarding the terms of a settlement in the class action lawsuit against the Corporation, members of its Board, and against GSD and Gyrodyne. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221;, below. On August 20, 2015 the shareholders of the Corporation voted to authorize the Merger with more than 99% of votes cast at the special meeting voting in favor, representing more than 76% of all outstanding shares. The merger closed on August 31, 2015 and common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC began trading on NASDAQ on September 1, 2015. The Merger completed the tax plan of liquidation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and resulted in holders of common stock of the Corporation receiving approximately 22.6% (335,086 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.0904 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per share of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock), holders of non-transferable Notes receiving approximately 30.0% (444,804 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.024798 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per $1.00 principal amount of the Dividend Notes issued in January 2014 and the Dividend Notes issued in December 2014, together, in each case, with any interest thereon paid in kind in the form of additional Notes), and holders of non-transferable interests in GSD receiving approximately 47.4% (702,790 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.473999 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per GSD interest). 

&#160; 

Plan of liquidation: 

In adopting the Plan of Liquidation for federal income tax purposes, the Corporation&#8217;s Board also determined to pursue the actual disposition of our remaining assets in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets. The Merger on August 31, 2015 completed the liquidation of the Corporation for federal income tax purposes within the two year period from the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, as provided by Section 562(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) even though the actual disposition of the properties within the same period had not necessarily occurred. Our Board believed that the prompt completion of the Tax Liquidation by means of the Merger while permitting a longer period to dispose of the remaining assets would help obtain better values by enabling the sales to take place without the potential timing constraints created by completing the Merger as promptly as practicable. In addition, the ability to extend the time of holding the properties would permit the Company to seek enhancements to the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor by pursuing various development or zoning opportunities. 

&#160; 

Following the merger, effective September 1, 2015 the Company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting, and accordingly will only report discontinued operations in the periods preceding the merger. 

&#160; 

Assets held for sale: 

Sale of real estate/Discontinued operations 

&#160; 

Prior to adopting the liquidation basis of accounting, the Company periodically classified real estate assets as held for sale, and these assets and their liabilities were stated separately on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company&#8217;s Board approved the hiring of real estate brokers to facilitate the sale of the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and Fairfax Medical Center. The Company expected to complete the sale of these properties within one year. Accordingly, as of April 1, 2014, all of the assets and liabilities that related to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and the Fairfax Medical Center were reported as assets held for sale, and liabilities held for sale, respectively. Additionally, all of the operations related to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center and the Fairfax Medical Center were reported as discontinued operations, and were reported as such in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The Company has not sold the Cortlandt Manor and Fairfax properties. 

&#160; 

In early 2015, the Corporation became aware that various aspects of the plaintiff&#8217;s claims in a putative class action lawsuit, see Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221;, against the Corporation, members of the Corporation&#8217;s Board, GSD and Gyrodyne, LLC were interfering with the aforementioned proposed sale of such properties. The defendants believed the lawsuit was without merit and continued to vigorously defend such action and took steps to seek to eliminate the issues created by the pending action against the sale. The Company believed that the issues would be resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and that it would be able to liquidate the properties proposed to be sold with no impact to fair value, assuming the market itself did not materially change during the period the Company needed to resolve such issues. As a result of this interference in the sale process, however, the Company believed that as of December 31, 2014, it no longer met the requirements for such assets and liabilities to qualify as assets and liabilities as held for sale and discontinued operations and therefore had reclassified them to operating assets and liabilities and continuing operations and did not report discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 or for the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

In June 2015 the Corporation entered into a stipulation with the plaintiff, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court of New York State, County of Suffolk, in July 2015, that removed the factors interfering with the aforementioned proposed sale of such properties. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2015, all of the assets and liabilities that related to the Cortlandt Medical Center and the Fairfax Medical Center were again reported as assets held for sale, and liabilities held for sale, respectively. Additionally, all of the operations related to the Cortlandt Medical Center and the Fairfax Medical Center were again reported as discontinued operations, and were reported as such in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The prior period assets and liabilities and operations related to these entities were recast as assets and liabilities held for sale, and discontinued operations retroactively for all periods presented on the Company&#8217;s quarterly report. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2015, the Company determined to seek to organize a Property Owner Association (&#8220;POA&#8221;) for the Port Jefferson Professional Park. The Company believes the POA will enable the Company to maximize the sales value of the ten buildings it owns in the Port Jefferson Professional Park through sales of individual buildings as opposed to selling them as a single block. The Company substantially completed the POA application process at the end of September and proceeded with an active marketing program of the individual buildings. The status of the POA and the ability of the Company to sell assets while pursuing the POA was not substantially known until late September. Therefore as of August 31, 2015, the Company did not meet the requirements for such assets and liabilities to qualify as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations and therefore continued to report them as operating assets and liabilities and continuing operations. In late 2015, the Company was informed that the POA was approved. 

&#160; 

Properties under contract or sold: 

&#160; 

Port Jefferson Professional Park . In November 2015, the Company entered into Purchase and Sale Agreements for the sale of two approximate 4,000 square foot buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park. The first building closed at a price of $760,000 on December 30, 2015 and the second building closed at a price of $850,000 on January 13, 2016. Furthermore, in February and March 2016, the Company entered into Purchase and Sale Agreements for the sale of two additional buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park for approximately $900,000 and $820,000, respectively, which are scheduled to close 45 days and 21 days, respectively, after a due diligence period that expires April 10, 2016 and May 4, 2016, respectively, assuming the buyers do not terminate the agreement during such due diligence periods which they are entitled to do for any reason or no reason. 

&#160; 

Fairfax Medical Center . On February 4, 2016 the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) to sell the Fairfax Medical Center, as amended, for a sales price of $14,315,000 to JAG Associates, L.L.C., a Virginia limited liability company (&#8220;JAG&#8221;). The material terms of the Agreement provide for: (i) an initial earnest money deposit in the amount of $250,000 payable by JAG to the escrow agent within five business days following the Effective Date that will be applied to the purchase price at closing; (ii) an evaluation period that will expire on April 11, 2016, during which time JAG shall have the right to terminate the Agreement by written notice to the Company, for any reason or no reason, prior to the expiration of the evaluation period, in which case JAG will have the right to receive a refund of its initial $250,000 earnest money deposit; (iii) if the Agreement is not terminated on or prior to April 11, 2016, JAG will be obligated to deliver an additional earnest money deposit to the escrow agent in the amount of $250,000, which together with the initial earnest money deposit will be applied toward the purchase price at closing; (iv) unless JAG terminates the Agreement on or prior to April 11, 2016, the closing shall occur on or before May 4, 2016. The agreement also contains a master lease (2 year term for approximately 4,700 square feet) to Gyrodyne for approximately $210,000 due quarterly if certain vacancies are not re-tenanted. The Company is actively marketing the space, the success of which will directly reduce the master lease obligation. The Agreement also contains additional customary covenants, conditions, representations and warranties. 

&#160; 

In summary, while we have not released or disclosed the appraised values of our individual real estate holdings, with over $1.6 million in closed transactions and another $16 million in contract, each sale or contract has been in excess of such values. 

&#160; 

Land Development 

&#160; 

The Company is pursuing various options to maximize the total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. Prior to the Merger, GSD did not have sufficient liquidity to effectively pursue the highest and best use zoning/entitlements of the Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield properties. Following the rights offering and Merger, the Company believes it possesses sufficient liquidity to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through the pursuit of the highest and best use zoning/entitlements. During the calendar year 2015, the Company incurred approximately $464,000 of land development costs, most of which were incurred during the fourth quarter. The Company estimates that it may incur approximately $3.15 million in additional charges over the next two years to continue enhancement efforts, including the pursuit of entitlements inclusive of zoning changes and special permits. 

&#160; 

The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to focus resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. In addition, the Company may entertain joint ventures or other types of relationships for the properties which might provide funds for earlier distributions to shareholders while simultaneously providing enhancements to the underlying values of the properties. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is uncertain, the Company believes the return on the estimated investment of $3.15 million will serve to increase the estimated distributions versus selling the properties with their current zoning and entitlements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cortlandt Manor Development: 

On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the &#8220;Town&#8221;) adopted its 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) of which one key strategy is the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District (&#8220;MOD&#8221;) . The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town&#8217;s existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development , including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian&#8217;s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For the past several months the Company and its planning consultants have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD. With the Plan and the MOD now approved, we believe the funds being expended by the Company in this effort will be justified through enhancing the value of this property as we move to its eventual disposition. 

&#160; 

Flowerfield Development: &#160; 

Similar to our efforts in the Town of Cortlandt, we are working closely with engineers and consultants on market research and related feasibility studies to identify how we can maximize Flowerfield&#8217;s value through a highest and best use approach. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown to seek out potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies which may not currently fall within our &#8220;as of right to build&#8221; zoning . We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, re-zoning or other concessions that would allow for any such development projects currently not permitted within existing development constraints. Such changes could eventually lead to a number of different development plans ranging from single family or age restricted housing to condominiums or other forms of real estate developments in support of the needs of an expanding Stony Brook University and its affiliated medical school and hospital. 

&#160;

In the region surrounding Flowerfield, Stony Brook University serves as an economic engine through capital investment and growth in employment, including high paying positions in the fields of science and medicine. However, adequate housing, both on and off campus, remains a challenge. While construction is nearing completion on the University&#8217;s campus for additional dormitory rooms, our initial research indicates further supply is needed at several levels - undergraduate, graduate, physician, interns, family and visiting professors. In addition, unlike many universities around the country, Stony Brook lacks a campus-focused center around which many university-related social and professional activities are conducted. Other options might be along the lines of a continuum of care or stand-alone assisted living or nursing facilities, which we believe would be in demand given Long Island&#8217;s senior community&#8217;s increasing needs for such services. Although there can be no assurances, we believe these investments intended to enhance Flowerfield&#8217;s value will result in higher sale proceeds, similar to our expenditures intended to enhance Cortlandt Manor&#8217;s potential value. 

&#160; 

Competition among industrial and medical office rental properties on Long Island, Cortlandt Manor, New York and Fairfax, Virginia is intense. Furthermore, the Company also competes in the development of industrial, medical office and residential property where the competition is equally intense. Numerous commercial property owners compete with the Company in attracting tenants. Many are substantially larger than the Company. 

&#160; 

Market Outlook 

&#160; 

Real estate pricing is generally influenced by market interest rates. However, prices and rates do not move simultaneously; rather, prices generally lag behind interest rate adjustments for a period of time. An uptick in lending rates usually translates into lower cash returns for investors who use leverage to buy investment properties. On the other hand, rising interest rates also suggest that the economy is improving, which in turn could lead to higher demand for commercial property, and potentially higher rental rates. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Today&#8217;s economic environment remains characterized by historically low interest rates which continue to compress capitalization rates for commercial properties. Furthermore, previously owned home sale prices continue to recover and new home construction continues at a pace that restricts supply. Commercial property prices have nearly recovered and or surpassed the 2007 pre-recession values in many sectors. During 2015, a majority of analysts believed that the economy was slowly moving from recovery status toward an expansionary cycle. On December 16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve (the &#8220;FOMC&#8221; or the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) announced an increase in the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The anticipation of this first increase in the federal funds rate since 2006 has been a primary source of much volatility in equity markets for real estate companies. Shortly after the FOMC meeting in late 2015, global market volatility and economic recoveries significantly deteriorated. Furthermore, the degradation in the energy industry and perhaps the commodities markets as a whole have put further pressure on both global markets and the US economy. These factors and others have contributed to FOMC statements following the March 2016 FOMC meeting suggesting that the FOMC has softened its views on the pace of the recovery, if any, the pace of further interest rate hikes in 2016, if any, and in fact whether further stimulus may be needed to address the economic stresses on the U.S. economy. 

&#160; 

Federal regulators and U.S. government policy can have a major impact on our business. The U.S. Federal Reserve is a major participant in, and its actions significantly impact, the commercial real estate debt markets. For example, quantitative easing, a bond buying program implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep long-term interest rates low and stimulate the U.S. economy, has had the effect of reducing the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. On October 29, 2014, however, the FOMC of the Federal Reserve Board announced an end to quantitative easing signaling that the Federal Reserve believed the U.S. economy was growing at a measured but sustained pace and that the need for continued stimulus diminished. These actions and Federal Reserve comments suggest that the Federal Reserve will eventually return to a normalized monetary policy. In December 2015, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate from the zero to one quarter percent target to a target of one quarter to one half percent. Furthermore, the FOMC gave indications that it may raise the rate in quarter point increments up to four times during 2016. However, the FOMC announced on March 16, 2016 that there will be no change in the target range for the federal funds rate , maintaining it at one quarter to one half percent. A second increase in March, following the initial increase in December, was widely expected by analysts after the December 2015 meeting, but expectations quickly changed in light of weak economic data that accumulated in the first quarter. The FOMC attributed its March decision to continuing progress in U.S. economic conditions but concerns about risks posed by global economic and financial developments. Any increase in real time rates could cause a disruption in the commercial lending market which could adversely affect the real estate industry, our real estate operations and or the value of any achievable real estate sales proceeds. 

&#160; 

The property management industry is directly affected by the economy and the commercial real estate market in particular. Our business may be affected by the market for medical office, residential and industrial properties as well as the general financial and credit markets and other market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole. As a result, our business could be impacted by general economic, financial and industry conditions, including (1) obtaining financing to renovate our current real estate holdings and or pursue the re-zoning efforts on the undeveloped property, (2) difficulty in consummating property transactions, (3) increased challenges in re-leasing space, and (4) potential risks stemming from late rental receipts, tenant defaults, or bankruptcies. 

&#160;

As a result of the economic downturn that began in the second half of 2007, demand for medical office, industrial, retail space and undeveloped property declined nationwide due to bankruptcies, downsizing, layoffs and cost cutting. Real estate transactions and development opportunities remain lessened in many markets compared to the period prior to the current economic downturn and capitalization rates rose. While the economy has improved, particularly the real estate industry, the recovery has been slow and not equally experienced across the United States. As a result, the cost and availability of credit during the downturn was, and if down markets return will again be, adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Economic weakness and uncertainty during the prior downturn led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. In light of the slow recovery, the adverse impact on commercial lending may continue which could adversely affect the net proceeds from the sale of any properties we currently manage. 

&#160; 

The aforementioned economic and industry trends may adversely impact our financial condition and our estimated net assets in liquidation because of the adverse impact they may have on the liquidity and financial condition of tenants and on the perception of investment opportunity on the part of potential real estate property purchasers. Our business may also be adversely affected by local economic conditions, as substantially all of our revenues are derived from our properties located in Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York and Fairfax County in Virginia. Our current portfolio consists primarily of medical office and industrial buildings comprising approximately 260,000 rentable square feet, and lacks the diversity of larger portfolios. If negative economic conditions return or even deteriorate, the Company&#8217;s estimated net assets in liquidation could be adversely effected, which could reduce our estimated distributions. 

&#160; 

Health Care Industry 

&#160; 

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the &#8220;Healthcare Legislation&#8221;) were signed into law. The complexities and ramifications of the Healthcare Legislation are significant, and will be implemented in a phased approach that began in 2010 and will conclude in 2018. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Health Care Legislation has affected medical office real estate due to the direct impact on the tenant base. At this time, the full effects of the Healthcare Legislation and its impact on our business, our revenues and financial condition and those of our tenants are not yet known. We believe that the Healthcare Legislation is causing medical professionals to review their real estate options which include remaining status quo, increasing tenant space to address a higher volume of patients, combining practices with other professionals as well as becoming hospital employees rather than continuing independent practices of medicine. Our business is being impacted by factors including (1) difficulty transitioning doctors to longer term leases, (2) difficulty maintaining or raising rental rates, (3) increased challenges in re-leasing space and (4) difficulty transitioning tenants into larger spaces, all of which individually or collectively can impact sales values and the timing of such sales. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the average effective rental revenue per square foot adjusted for tenant improvements was $19.52, compared to $19.83 on December 31, 2014. The Company defines the effective revenue per square foot as the annual rate per square foot stated in the lease reduced by the average annual tenant improvement allowance provided for in such leases. 

&#160; 

Business O perations/Liquidation 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2013, the Corporation distributed to its shareholders all of the equity interests of GSD, which owned 100% of the interests in the Corporation&#8217;s four real properties, subject to related mortgage debt in favor of Flowerfield Mortgage Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, with the Corporation having the contractual right to manage the business and properties of GSD. The Corporation&#8217;s Board also approved the Plan of Merger, subject to approval of shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares, pursuant to which the Corporation and GSD would be merged with and into Gyrodyne, LLC with the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders, holders of GSD equity interests and holders of interests in the Notes all exchanging their respective interests for equity interests in Gyrodyne, LLC. On September 25, 2014, the Corporation announced the 2014 Annual meeting and the previously postponed special meeting to vote on the proposed merger would be held coextensively on December 5, 2014 at Flowerfield Celebrations, Mills Pond Road, Saint James, New York 11780, at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The Corporation was advised by its proxy solicitor, MacKenzie Partners, that with approximately 45% of the outstanding shares voted thus far by delivery of proxy cards, approximately 97% of such shares were voted in favor of the Merger. Despite the overwhelming percentage of received votes in favor of the Merger not enough shares were voted to reach the two-thirds majority needed under New York law. Accordingly, on November 4, 2014, the Corporation announced that the Corporation&#8217;s special meeting originally scheduled for August 14, 2014 and previously postponed to August 27, 2014 and then again to December 5, 2014, would be further postponed. Given the small size of holdings of many shareholders of the Corporation and the nature of various holders, the Corporation believed those shareholders may not have paid enough attention to the Merger to exercise their right to vote in 2014. The Corporation and its advisors continued to analyze potential options of the Corporation and its shareholders, including enhancements designed to facilitate the ability to complete the merger transaction. As further discussed above, under the &#8220;Strategic Process&#8221; heading, on March 6, 2015 the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a rights offering to its existing shareholders. The Corporation commenced the rights offering to facilitate the vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares needed under New York law to approve the previously announced proposed merger of the Corporation and Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC with and into Gyrodyne, LLC, as well as raise equity capital in a timely and cost-effective manner while providing all of the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders the opportunity to participate. 

&#160; 

On June 22, 2015 the Corporation announced that it received subscriptions for approximately 7,044,894 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 2,224,020. The rights offering resulted in 2,224,020 common shares issued on June 26, 2015 and net proceeds received (after expenses) of $5,606,190 (Gross proceeds of $6,116,055 less direct expenses of the rights offering of $509,865). 

&#160; 

The Corporation also announced on June 22, 2015 that its previously postponed special meeting of shareholders at which shareholders would be asked to authorize the previously announced merger of the Corporation and GSD with and into Gyrodyne LLC would be held on August 20, 2015. More than 99% of votes cast at the special meeting voted in favor of the transaction, representing more than 76% of all outstanding shares. The Merger closed on August 31, 2015 and Gyrodyne, LLC common shares began trading on NASDAQ on September 1, 2015. The Merger completed the Plan of Liquidation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and resulted in holders of common stock of the Corporation receiving approximately 22.6% (335,086 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.0904 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per share of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock), holders of non-transferable Notes receiving approximately 30.0% (444,804 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.024798 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per $1.00 principal amount of the Dividend Notes issued in January 2014 and the Dividend Notes issued in December 2014, together, in each case, with any interest thereon paid in kind in the form of additional Notes), and holders of non-transferable interests in GSD receiving approximately 47.4% (702,790 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.47399 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per GSD interest). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We have focused our business strategy on maximizing the intrinsic value per share through aligning our operating and investment strategy with our goal of executing on a tax efficient liquidity event or series of tax efficient liquidity events. During the third quarter of 2015, the Corporation completed within the two year deadline the tax plan of liquidation by completing the Merger of GSD and the Corporation with and into Gyrodyne, LLC, thereby ensuring the prior 2013 and 2014 distributions and future distributions were and will continue to be done in a tax efficient manner. Our strategy going forward is to seek the opportunistic sale of our properties, albeit without the timing constraints that existed prior to the completion of the Corporation&#8217;s tax liquidation, which may include value enhancement of out Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. To accomplish this, the Company&#8217;s plan will consist of: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

managing the real estate portfolio to improve operating cash flow while simultaneously increasing the market values of the underlying operating properties; 

&#160; &#9679; 

managing the opportunistic sale of certain properties or real estate assets; 

&#160; &#9679; 

pursuing the re-zoning/entitlement efforts of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value; &#160; &#9679; 

focusing use of capital by the Company to that which preserves or improves the market value of the real estate portfolio; 

&#160; &#9679; 

balancing working capital and funds available for the development process with making distributions during the liquidation process. 

&#160; 

The completion of the Corporation&#8217;s tax liquidation by means of the Merger removes the timing constraints associated with the tax liquidation and now provides Gyrodyne the opportunity to pursue without such constraints the opportunistic disposition of certain properties and the enhancement of the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor by pursuing various development or zoning opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common interests. We are unable to predict the precise nature, amount or timing of such distributions. 

&#160; 

Sales of properties by Gyrodyne could take the form of individual sales of assets, as has been our recent experience in Port Jefferson, sales of groups of assets, a single sale of all or substantially all of the assets or some other form of sale. The assets may be sold to one or more purchasers in one or more transactions over a period of time. 

&#160; 

A sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company would require shareholder approval under New York law. However, in the event of the sale of individual properties, it is not required or anticipated that any shareholder votes will be solicited. The prices at which the various assets may be sold depends largely on factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the condition of financial markets, the availability of financing to prospective purchasers of the assets, U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals, public market perceptions, and limitations on transferability of certain assets. 

&#160; 

We cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all of the Company&#8217;s properties. Assuming the completion of the liquidation of the Company takes until 2018, and giving effect to its estimated cash flow from operation of its existing properties until their sale, the Company expects Gyrodyne would have a cash balance of approximately $43.5 million, prior to any future dividend distributions. Such cash would equate to future post-merger liquidating distribution of $29.31 per share based on Gyrodyne LLC, having 1,482,680 common interests outstanding. These estimated distributions do not include any additional value that the Company believes it can derive from the investments it is making to maximize the value on Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is volatile, the Company believes the internal rate of return from the estimated investment of $3.15 million on enhancement efforts will improve the estimated distributions versus selling the real estate under its current zoning and entitlements. In addition, while it could be argued that approximately $1 million of land development costs are for environmental impact and other infrastructure studies that can be utilized by a potential buyer, such value was not included in the fair value of the real estate disclosed in the statement of net assets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The statement of net assets is based on certain estimates. Uncertainties as to the precise value of our non-cash assets, which exclude any estimated additional value achievable from the costs incurred to pursue the maximum value on Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through certain land development efforts (mainly restricted to researching highest and best use and the pursuit of certain related entitlements, special permits and or zone changes) and the ultimate amount of our liabilities make it impracticable to predict the aggregate net value ultimately distributable to shareholders in a liquidation. Land development costs, claims, liabilities and expenses from operations, including operating costs, salaries, income taxes, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses, will continue to be incurred during the business plan of liquidation, which may include certain enhancement efforts. While certain professional fees, such as legal expenses and the fees of outside financial advisors remained high during 2015, they were mainly incurred to support and complete the Corporation&#8217;s tax plan of liquidation via the Merger. The Company believes the legal and related consulting fees, excluding advisory fees to support the land development effort, will be significantly reduced going forward. Nevertheless, expenses incurred in pursuing the Company&#8217;s business plan will reduce the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to shareholders, and, while a precise estimate of those expenses cannot currently be made, management and our Board believe that available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims (including contingent liabilities) and to make cash distributions to shareholders. However, no assurances can be given that available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims and to make cash distributions to shareholders. If such available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets are not adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims, distributions of cash and other assets to our shareholders will be reduced and could be eliminated. 

&#160;

Real Estate 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company owns the 68 acre site called Flowerfield, primarily zoned for light industry, which is located approximately 50 miles east of New York City on the north shore of Long Island in the hamlet of St. James, New York, in the Town of Smithtown. Flowerfield&#39;s location also places it in hydrological zone VIII, one of the most liberal with respect to effluent discharge rates. Gyrodyne currently has 130,533 square feet of rentable space located on approximately 10 acres of developed property at Flowerfield. As of December 31, 2015, there were 37 tenants, comprising 41 leases and 9 long-term tenants under month-to-month commitments. The annual base rent at Flowerfield based on the rates in effect as of December 2015 is $1,527,000 which included month-to-month annualized base rent of $133,000 on 10,986 square feet. The occupancy rate is 70% as of December 31, 2015. Studies including environmental, archeological, ecological and traffic have been conducted in connection with previous development plans - all with no significant adverse findings. The Company believes that material costs will not be incurred in connection with compliance with environmental laws. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no material expenses related to environmental issues. 

&#160; 

On June 27, 2007, the Company acquired ten buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park in Port Jefferson Station, New York. At the end of 2015, the Company sold 5 Medical Drive (4,000 square foot building) for $760,000 and in early 2016 sold 6 Medical Drive (4,000 square foot building) for $850,000. In addition, the Company is in contract for 4 Medical Drive for $900,000 and 8 Medical Drive for $820,000 and continues to actively market the remaining 6 buildings. The ten buildings were originally acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $8,850,000 or $225 per square foot. The Company funded $5,551,191 of the purchase price by the assumption of the existing mortgage debt on the property with the remainder in cash after adjustments. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in January 2013 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne which was settled in full as part of the merger on August 31, 2015. The buildings, at the time of purchase, were located at 1-6, 8, 9 and 11 Medical Drive and 5380 Nesconset Highway in Port Jefferson Station, and situated on 5.16 acres with 39,329 square feet of rentable space. As of December 31, 2015, after the sale of 5 Medical Drive, there were 14 tenants, comprising 14 leases. The annual base rent based on the rates in effect as of December 2015 is $709,000 which included month&#8211;to-month annualized base rent of $21,000 on approximately 800 square feet. The occupancy rate was 74% as of December 31, 2015. The acquisition of this property qualified for the deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

&#160; 

On June 2, 2008, the Company acquired the Cortlandt Medical Center in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The property consists of five office buildings which are situated on 5.01 acres with 31,198 square feet of rentable space on the date of acquisition. The purchase price was $7 million or $231 per square foot. As of December 31, 2015, there were 16 tenants, comprising 14 leases. The annual base rent based on the rates in effect as of December 2015 is approximately $783,000. The property was 100% occupied as of December 31, 2015. Of the $7 million purchase price for the property, the Company paid $1,750,000 in cash and received financing in the amount of $5,250,000. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in November 2012 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne which was settled in full as part of the Merger on August 31, 2015. The acquisition of this property qualified for the deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code. Following certain capital improvements, the rentable square feet currently is 31,421 square feet. 

&#160; 

On August 29, 2008, the Company acquired a 1,600 square foot single-family residential dwelling located on 1.43 acres at 1987 Crompond Road, Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price was $305,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale by the seller. The property is located directly across the street from the Hudson Valley Hospital Center and adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center. The property is zoned for medical office use by special permit and is potentially a future development site for expansion of the Cortlandt Medical Center. This property has not been mortgaged. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In March 2016, the Company acquired a four acre undeveloped lot for $150,000 which the Company believes is synergistic to maximizing the value on one of its properties. 

&#160; 

On March 31, 2009, the Company acquired the Fairfax Medical Center in Fairfax City, Virginia. The property consists of two office buildings which are situated on 3.5 acres with 57,621 square feet of rentable space at date of acquisition. The purchase price was $12,891,000 or $224 per square foot. As of December 31, 2015, there were 26 tenants, comprising 27 leases, renting space with an annual base rent of $1,425,000, based on the rates in effect as of December 2015. The occupancy rate as of December 31, 2015 was 88%. Of the $12,891,000 purchase price, the Company paid $4,891,000 in cash and received financing in the amount of $8,000,000. The acquisition of this property qualified for the deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code and completed the tax-efficient reinvestment program of the $26.3 million advance payment received in connection with the condemnation of the 245 acres of the Flowerfield property. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in December 2012 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne which was settled in full as part of the merger on August 31, 2015. On February 4, 2016 the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell the Fairfax Medical Center, as amended, for a sales price of $14,315,000 to JAG Associates, L.L.C., a Virginia limited liability company. The material terms of the Agreement provide for: (i) an initial earnest money deposit in the amount of $250,000 payable by JAG to the escrow agent within five business days following the Effective Date that will be applied to the purchase price at closing; (ii) an evaluation period that will expire on April 11, 2016, during which time JAG shall have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice to the Company, for any reason or no reason, prior to the expiration of the evaluation period, in which case JAG will have the right to receive a refund of its initial $250,000 earnest money deposit; (iii) if the agreement is not terminated on or prior to April 11, 2016, JAG will be obligated to deliver an additional earnest money deposit to the escrow agent in the amount of $250,000, which together with the initial earnest money deposit will be applied toward the purchase price at closing; (iv) unless JAG terminates the agreement on or prior to April 11, 2016, the closing shall occur on or before May 4, 2016. The agreement also contains a master lease (2 year term for approximately 4,700 square feet) to Gyrodyne for approximately $210,000 due quarterly if certain vacancies are not re-tenanted. The Company is actively marketing the space, the success of which will directly reduce the master lease obligation. The agreement also contains additional customary covenants, conditions, representations and warranties. 

&#160; 

On May 20, 2010, the Company acquired the building located at 1989 Crompond Road, Cortlandt Manor, New York. The property consists of 2,450 square feet of rentable space on 1.6 acres. The purchase price for the property was approximately $720,000. This property is adjacent to the 1.43 acre property acquired by the Company in August 2008, and these two properties combined result in the Company owning approximately three acres directly across Crompond Road from the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in addition to the 5.01 acre Cortlandt Medical Center site. The Company financed approximately 90% of the purchase price utilizing its then revolving credit facility, which was prepaid in full in December 2012. The property was 49% occupied as of December 31, 2015 by one tenant with a total annual base rent of $15,600. 

&#160; 

Land Development: 

The Company is pursuing various options to maximize the total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. Prior to the Merger, GSD did not have sufficient liquidity to effectively pursue the highest and best use zoning/entitlements of the Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield properties. Following the rights offering and Merger, the Company believes it possesses sufficient liquidity to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through the pursuit of the highest and best use zoning/entitlements. During the calendar year 2015, the Company incurred approximately $464,000 of land development costs, most of which were incurred during the fourth quarter. The Company estimates that it may incur approximately $3.15 million in additional charges over the next two years to continue enhancement efforts, including the pursuit of entitlements inclusive of zoning changes and special permits. 

&#160; 

The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to focus resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. In addition, the Company may entertain joint ventures or other types of relationships for the properties which might provide funds for earlier distributions to shareholders while simultaneously providing enhancements to the underlying values of the properties. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is uncertain, the Company believes the return on the estimated investment of $3.15 million will serve to increase the estimated distributions versus selling the properties with their current zoning and entitlements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cortlandt Manor Development: 

On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the &#8220;Town&#8221;) adopted its 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) of which one key strategy is the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District (&#8220;MOD&#8221;) . The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town&#8217;s existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development , including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian&#8217;s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For the past several months the Company and its planning consultants have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD. With the Plan and the MOD now approved, we believe the funds being expended by the Company in this effort will be justified through enhancing the value of this property as we move to its eventual disposition. 

&#160; 

Flowerfield Development: 

&#160; 

Similar to our efforts in the Town of Cortlandt, we are working closely with engineers and consultants on market research and related feasibility studies to identify how we can maximize Flowerfield&#8217;s value through a highest and best use approach. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown to seek out potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies which may not currently fall within our &#8220;as of right to build&#8221; zoning . We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, re-zoning or other concessions that would allow for any such development projects currently not permitted within existing development constraints. Such changes could eventually lead to a number of different development plans ranging from single family or age restricted housing to condominiums or other forms of real estate developments in support of the needs of an expanding Stony Brook University and its affiliated medical school and hospital. 

&#160;

In the region surrounding Flowerfield, Stony Brook University serves as an economic engine through capital investment and growth in employment, including high paying positions in the fields of science and medicine. However, adequate housing, both on and off campus, remains a challenge. While construction is nearing completion on the University&#8217;s campus for additional dormitory rooms, our initial research indicates further supply is needed at several levels - undergraduate, graduate, physician, interns, family and visiting professors. In addition, unlike many universities around the country, Stony Brook lacks a campus-focused center around which many university-related social and professional activities are conducted. Other options might be along the lines of a continuum of care or stand-alone assisted living or nursing facilities, which we believe would be in demand given Long Island&#8217;s senior community&#8217;s increasing needs for such services. Although there can be no assurances, we believe these investments intended to enhance Flowerfield&#8217;s value will result in higher sale proceeds, similar to our expenditures intended to enhance Cortlandt Manor&#8217;s potential value. 

&#160; 

Limited Partnership Investment in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. (the &#8220;Grove&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The Company has maintained an interest in the Grove, which originally represented a 20% limited partnership interest beginning in 1965. The Grove owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove located in Palm Beach County, Florida, which is the subject of a plan for mixed-use development. Based on four subsequent capital raises through 2009, each of which the Corporation chose not to participate in, the Company&#8217;s share was diluted to approximately 9.32% as of December 31, 2013. During 2014, certain partners elected to give back their limited partnership interests to the Grove, which resulted in increasing the Company&#8217;s share to 10.12% as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

On March 18, 2011, the Grove&#8217;s lender, Prudential Industrial Properties, LLC ("Prudential"), commenced an action against the Grove by filing a complaint in the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County to foreclose upon the Grove property, alleging that the Grove defaulted on its loan from Prudential and that the Grove was indebted to Prudential in an amount of over $37 million in principal and over $8 million in interest and fees. On September 19, 2013, the Grove was sold, the foreclosure lawsuit was dismissed and the Grove&#8217;s debt to Prudential was repaid. The investment is held in a subsidiary of the Company with $0 value. Gyrodyne did not receive any distribution in connection with the sale. Under the agreement with the purchaser, the Grove may receive payments if certain development benchmarks are achieved by the purchaser. Gyrodyne cannot predict whether these benchmarks will be achieved or as to the timing or amount of any further distributions by the Grove. The aforementioned transactions resulted in taxable gains to the Corporation in 2014 but no book gain. The Corporation had a deferred tax liability related to the Grove of $1,315,000, at December 31, 2013, which represented taxable losses not yet recorded pursuant to the equity method of accounting. The Corporation reversed the deferred tax liability in total in 2014 and recorded a current tax liability of approximately $618,000 and a tax benefit of $697,000, in the taxable REIT subsidiary. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company stopped recording losses after the carrying value of the investment was reduced to zero. The gain does not show up on the financial statements, as there were unrecorded accumulated prior year net operating losses which were not recorded as the investment basis was zero. Pursuant to the equity method of accounting, the 2014 gain is reduced by such accumulated unrecorded losses. As of December 31, 2015, the Company no longer has any accumulated prior year losses. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The purchaser of the Grove Property, Minto Group, formally refers to the development project as Westlake. In October 2014, Westlake was approved by the Palm Beach County Commission to develop 4,546 homes, 2.1 million square feet of commercial development, a 3,000-student university and a 150-unit hotel. Minto Group announced on February 18, 2016 that groundbreaking for Westlake could take place in as early as 90 days and that residential sales were expected to begin in early 2017. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the original sale agreement for the Grove Property and given the status of development and sales, Gyrodyne does not expect distributions to the partnership, if any, until 2017 at the earliest. The amount of distributions, if any, ultimately received by Gyrodyne will depend on The Grove&#8217;s receipts from Westlake and the liabilities and expenses of the Grove, a limited partnership, that must be settled prior to any distributions to Gyrodyne . 

&#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

Prior to the Merger Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. qualified as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal and state income tax purposes under section 856(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). As long as the Corporation qualified for taxation as a REIT, it generally was not subject to federal and state income tax. If the Corporation failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even if the Company qualified as a REIT, it may have been subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. The Corporation received PLR-135927-10 (&#8220;PLR&#8221;), a Private Letter Ruling dated March 1, 2011 addressing the tax impact to REIT status from condemnation proceeds. The PLR ruling stated the condemnation award would not be considered in determining whether the Corporation satisfied the REIT asset test under (i) Internal Revenue Code Section 856(c)(4) and (ii) under Section 856(c)(5)(J) the interest on the award and the reimbursement of costs derived from the claim would not be considered in determining whether the Corporation satisfied the REIT gross income test under sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3). 

&#160; 

Following a change in tax law in January 2013, retroactive to January 2012, reducing the recognition period for REIT owned property applicable for the 2012 taxable year to five years, the Corporation applied for another private letter ruling from the IRS in March 2013 and ultimately received a favorable ruling on September 12, 2013. The PLR concluded that the Corporation&#8217;s receipt of the additional damages in July 2012 in connection with the judgment in the Corporation&#8217;s favor in its condemnation litigation with the State of New York occurred outside of the applicable recognition period for 2012, and therefore permitted the Corporation to distribute, by means of a dividend such as the Special Dividend described below, the gains realized from its receipt of the 2012 Proceeds, subject to a 4% excise tax, in order to avoid incurring the corporate level tax. 

&#160; 

On September 13, 2013, the Board declared the First Special Dividend, in the amount of $98,685,000, or $66.56 per share, of which approximately $68,000,000, or $45.86 per share, was paid in cash. The balance of the First Special Dividend was paid in the form of interests in GSD to which the Corporation transferred its remaining real estate assets subject to mortgage obligations to a subsidiary of the Corporation of $13,840,889. GSD would generally be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes so long as 90 percent of its gross income is &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. &#8220;Qualifying income&#8221; includes real property rents and gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property held for sale to customers as described in section 1221 (a)(1)). If GSD failed to meet this requirement it would be taxable as a corporation. 

&#160; 

In accordance with REIT distribution requirements, on December 20, 2013, the Corporation announced the Second Special Dividend of $10.89 per share which was paid on January 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2013. The dividend was paid in the form of interests in a subordinated global dividend note of $16,150,000 that was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2017. The annual interest rate was 5% payable semiannually in kind or cash on June 15 th and December 15 th . 

&#160; 

In addition, on September 15, 2014, the Board declared a special supplemental dividend in the amount of $682,033 (approximately $0.46 per share), the remaining undistributed balance of the 2013 taxable income, paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note issued on December 31, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2014 (the &#8220;2014 Dividend Note&#8221;, and together with the Dividend Note, the &#8220;Dividend Notes&#8221;). With the exception of the face value of the note, all terms and conditions mirror the terms and conditions of the previous notes issued. Accordingly, the allocation of Gyrodyne, LLC Shares previously designated for holders of interests in the subordinated global Dividend Note will now include as well holders of interests in the 2014 Dividend Note, unless otherwise paid, and the percentage so allocated will be adjusted to reflect the addition of the $682,033 principal amount of the 2014 Dividend Note. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s investment in the Grove is held in a subsidiary (deemed a taxable REIT subsidiary when the Corporation was a REIT) which also is the subsidiary that recorded the taxable operating results under the Corporation&#8217;s management services agreement with GSD. In 2014, the Corporation recognized a tax benefit of approximately $697,000 related to deferred taxes on its investment in the Grove which was partially offset by approximately $132,000 of tax expense on the remaining taxable income of the subsidiary. 

&#160; 

Following the completion of the Merger, effective September 1, 2015, Gyrodyne, LLC, the surviving company in the Merger, will not qualify as a REIT but is structured as a limited liability company which is treated as a partnership, a pass-through entity for Federal income tax purposes. Gyrodyne, LLC is generally treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes so long as 90 percent of its gross income is &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. &#8220;Qualifying income&#8221; includes real property rents and gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property held for sale to customers as described in section 1221 (a)(1)). If Gyrodyne, LLC fails to meet this requirement it may be taxable as a corporation. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The rental properties are located in St. James, Port Jefferson Station, and Cortlandt Manor, New York and Fairfax, Virginia. The Company competes in the leasing of medical, professional and general office space and engineering, manufacturing and warehouse space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the Company and may generally be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risk with respect to creditworthiness of tenants. Principal factors of competition in the Company&#8217;s rental property business are: the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, financial strength of its competitors, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in its relevant market. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 

&#160; 

In pursuit of its business plan, and the sale of properties, the Company competes with other real estate investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, public and private real estate investment trusts, private individuals and other domestic real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than the Company. With respect to properties presently owned by the Company, it competes with other owners of like properties for tenants. 

&#160; 

Internal Growth and Effective Asset Management 

&#160; 

Tenant Relations and L ease C ompliance &#8211; We strive to maintain strong contacts with our tenants in order to understand their current and future real estate rental and development needs. We directly monitor each of our rental properties to ensure they are properly maintained and meet the needs of our tenants. 

&#160; 

Extending Lease M aturities - We seek to extend leases in advance of expirations to achieve high occupancy levels. Additionally, our renewal efforts focus on converting our leases to longer terms at each of our properties, to achieve a multitenant portfolio with a balanced rollover risk. 

&#160; 

Financing Strategy 

&#160; 

General &#8211; Through early 2013, our principal source of financing had been property specific debt to leverage specific acquisitions, for 2010 the utilization of the revolving line of credit (&#8220;Revolver&#8221;) and the cash proceeds from the rights offering in 2011. The Revolver was utilized to finance the 2010 acquisition of property in Cortlandt Manor, New York, and support capital improvements and general working capital. Following the Corporation&#8217;s receipt of condemnation proceeds in July 2012, the Corporation&#8217;s principal source of financing became cash on hand and cash flow from operations. 

&#160; 

Financing &#8211; Historically, the Corporation financed its operations utilizing cash on hand, cash flow from operations and property specific debt. The economic uncertainty made it challenging to negotiate debt at acceptable terms during 2011. As a result, during 2011, the Corporation raised capital through a sale of additional common stock &#8211; see Equity Financing. The Company believes it is currently well capitalized with adequate cash levels to operate the business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In accordance with REIT distribution requirements, on December 20, 2013, the Corporation announced a dividend of $10.89 per share which was paid on January 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2013. The dividend was paid in the form of interests in a subordinated global dividend note payable that was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2017. The annual interest rate was 5% payable semiannually in kind or cash on June 15 th and December 15 th . On June 16, 2014, the initial semi-annual interest payment on the Dividend Note was paid in kind in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global 5% subordinated note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $302,813 that otherwise is identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. On December 15, 2014, and June 15, 2015, the second and third semi-annual interest payment on the original Dividend Note were paid in kind in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global 5% subordinated note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $403,750, respectively for both periods, that otherwise is identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. The initial interest due of $7,570 on the note issued on June 16, 2014 was paid in cash on December 15, 2014. 

&#160;

On September 15, 2014, the Board declared a special supplemental dividend in the amount of $682,033, paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note issued on December 31, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2014. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the &#8220;Plan of Merger&#8221; effective August 31, 2015, all of the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding notes (inclusive of the global dividend notes and the subordinated notes (&#8220;Notes&#8221;)) and accrued and unpaid interest were satisfied in full in exchange for 30% of the common shares of Gyrodyne LLC. For further discussion see &#8220;Approval and Consummation of the Merger&#8221; below. 

&#160;

Equity Financing &#8211; During 2011, the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register a number of shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock to be offered in a rights offering by the Corporation to its shareholders with maximum gross proceeds of $9,210,000, or $10,210,000 if an over-allotment option was exercised. The Corporation received subscriptions for approximately 294,685 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 173,305. The Corporation elected to exercise its overallotment option to issue an additional 19,336 shares to satisfy approximately 16% of the over-subscription requests, the maximum amount allowed under the registration statement. Shareholders were allocated 100% of their basic subscriptions. The rights offering resulted in 192,641 common shares issued, and net proceeds (after expenses) raised of $9,961,476. The proceeds were used for potential additional expenses in the condemnation litigation, pursuing development rights for the Flowerfield property, necessary capital improvements in our real estate portfolio and general working capital. 

&#160; 

On March 6, 2015, the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a rights offering to the Corporation&#8217;s existing shareholders. On April 10, 2015 and May 15, 2015, the Corporation filed amendments to the registration statement to replace the financial statements and related financial information in the original filing of the registration statement with the updated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 and as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively and other updated financial information related thereto. The Board believed that the rights offering would facilitate the vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares needed under New York law to approve the proposed Merger. Given the small size of holdings of many shareholders of the Corporation and the nature of various holders, the Corporation believed those shareholders may not have paid enough attention to the Merger to exercise their right to vote during 2014. The Board believed that shareholders who exercised their subscription rights in the rights offering were more likely to vote their shares on the Merger proposal. 

&#160; 

On April 27, 2015, the Corporation announced that it had set May 6, 2015 as the record date for its previously announced rights offering, and that the subscription price for the rights offering would be $2.75 per share. In the rights offering, the Corporation distributed, at no charge, to shareholders as of the record date non-transferable subscription rights to purchase, on a three-for-two basis, up to an aggregate of 2,224,020 shares of Gyrodyne common stock. 

&#160; 

On May 18, 2015, the SEC declared the registration statement effective, and on May 19, 2015, the Corporation announced the commencement of the rights offering. The Corporation effected the rights offering through the distribution of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase shares of its common stock at $2.75 per share subject to certain aggregate ownership limitations. In the rights offering, shareholders received three subscription rights for each two shares of common stock held of record on May 6, 2015, with each subscription right giving a shareholder the right to purchase one share of common stock. The rights offering also included an over-subscription privilege, which entitled each rights holder that exercised its basic subscription privilege in full, the right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering, subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising this over-subscription right. The rights offering did not contain an overallotment option. 

&#160; 

On June 17, 2015, the Corporation closed the rights offering and on June 22, 2015 the Corporation announced that it received subscriptions for approximately 7,044,894 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 2,224,020. Shareholders were allocated 100% of their basic subscriptions. Based on the maximum 2,224,020 shares that were issued in the rights offering, 1,214,644 shares were allocated to shareholders who properly exercised their oversubscription privilege, pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of shares subscribed for under the over-subscription privilege, or 20.12499% of each over-subscriber&#8217;s requested shares. The rights offering resulted in 2,224,020 common shares issued on June 26, 2015 and net proceeds received (after expenses) of $5,606,190 (Gross proceeds of $6,116,055 less direct expenses of the rights offering of $509,865). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Merger Allocations . The Plan of Merger originally provided for an allocation of Gyrodyne LLC interests to be issued in the Merger of 15.2% to shareholders of the Corporation, 29.2% to the holders of interests in notes issued by the Corporation in the aggregate principal amount of $17,937,000 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) plus accrued and unpaid interest and 55.6% to the holders of common interests of GSD (collectively, the &#8220;Initial Allocations&#8221;). The Plan of Merger as revised by the December 2013 amendment provided that each of the Initial Allocations set forth therein of Gyrodyne, LLC interests to be issued in the Merger in exchange for common shares of the Corporation, GSD Interests and interests in the Notes would be subject to adjustment in the discretion of the Corporation&#8217;s Board. The Plan of Merger provided that any changes made to the Initial Allocations would be announced at least ten days prior to the meeting of shareholders at which shareholders of the Corporation would be asked to consider and vote upon the Plan of Merger. 

&#160; 

At a meeting held on April 24, 2015, the Corporation&#8217;s Board determined to adjust the allocation of common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC to be issued pursuant to the Merger to account for certain developments since such allocations were originally set in December 2013. As adjusted, the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC issued in the Merger were allocated as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 22.6% in the aggregate to shareholders of the Corporation; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 30.0% in the aggregate to holders of interests in the Notes; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Approximately 47.4% in the aggregate to holders of common interests of GSD. 

&#160; 

The allocations reflected adjusted net book value, face value and &#8220;fair value&#8221; (based on appraised values of underlying properties owned by GSD, less liabilities) of the Corporation, the Notes and GSD, respectively, in each case as of December 31, 2014. In addition, the Board determined the foregoing allocation adjustments based on the increase in the adjusted net book value of its shares due to the rights offering and the anticipated net proceeds to the Corporation of $5,606,000 from the rights offering (actual net proceeds was $5,606,190), assuming all 2,224,020 shares were sold. This methodology was consistent with the valuation metrics used to determine the original allocations in December, 2013. 

&#160; 

Approval and Consummation of the Merger. Following the completion of the rights offering on June 17, 2015, the Corporation&#8217;s Board established June 29, 2015 as the record date for determining shareholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting, and that the special meeting would take place on August 20, 2015. On July 1, 2015 the Corporation filed a supplement to the proxy statement/prospectus dated July 1, 2014 to provide additional information to the proxy statement prospectus. On August 17, 2015, the Corporation filed supplement number 2 to the proxy statement/prospectus dated July 1, 2014 to provide supplemental information regarding the terms of a settlement in the class action lawsuit against the Corporation, members of its Board, and against GSD and Gyrodyne.

&#160; 

On August 20, 2015, the shareholders of the Corporation voted to authorize the Merger with more than 99% of votes cast at the special meeting voting in favor, representing more than 76% of all outstanding shares. The Merger closed on August 31, 2015 and common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC began trading on NASDAQ on September 1, 2015. The Merger completed the Corporation&#8217;s tax plan of liquidation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and resulted in holders of common stock of the Corporation receiving approximately 22.6% (335,086 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.0904 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per share of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock), holders of non-transferable Notes receiving approximately 30.0% (444,804 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.024798 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per $1.00 principal amount of the Dividend Notes issued in January 2014 and the Dividend Notes issued in December 2014, together, in each case, with any interest thereon paid in kind in the form of additional Notes), and holders of non-transferable interests in GSD receiving approximately 47.4% (702,790 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.473999 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per GSD interest). 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

In connection with the conduct of our business, we may order a Phase 1 environmental report and, when necessary, a Phase 2 environmental report. Based on a review of such reports, and our ongoing review of each of our properties, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance that (i) changes in law, (ii) the conduct of tenants, (iii) activities related to properties in the surrounding area, (iv) contamination through the water table due to the low elevation and immediate proximity of the industrial park to the Long Island Sound or (v) the discovery of environmental conditions the extent or severity of which were unknown, will not expose us to material liability in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company believes that each of its properties is in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of its properties that would require any material capital expenditure for the remediation thereof. No assurance can be given, however, that environmental regulations will not in the future have a materially adverse effect on the properties. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

The Company carries comprehensive liability, property, terrorism and umbrella insurance coverage which includes fire, flood, earthquakes and business interruption insurance and covers all of our properties. The Company annually reviews its policies with regard to both risk management and the underlying premiums and believes the policy specifications, insurance limits and deductibles are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of the Company&#8217;s management, all of its properties are adequately insured. 

&#160; 

Major Tenants 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, rental income from the three largest tenants represented approximately 8%, 6% and 5% of total rental income. 

&#160; 

The three largest tenants by revenue as of December 31, 2015 consist of a state agency located in the industrial park, another tenant in the industrial park and a medical tenant in one of our medical parks. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2014, rental income from the three largest tenants represented approximately 8%, 5% and 5% of total rental income. The Company received notice in November 2013 that the largest tenant, a state agency, would not be renewing two of its three leases in March 2014 resulting in a reduction of approximately 8,900 leased square feet and related reduction in annual revenue of approximately $135,000. 

&#160; 

The current economic challenges facing state and local budgets impacted 2 of the 3 largest tenants. One of these tenants had multiple leases, two of which were not renewed during 2014 and there can be no assurance that the remaining leases will renew for the same square footage, at favorable rates, if at all. 

&#160; 

&#160; Fiscal year 2015 Transaction Summary 

&#160; 

The following summarizes our significant transactions and other activity during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Debt Financing 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2013, the Corporation distributed 100% of the interests in GSD to its shareholders to satisfy the non-cash portion of the dividend declared on September 13, 2013 and paid on December 30, 2013. The Corporation contributed 100% of its real estate to GSD prior to the distribution, with the medical properties subject to mortgage obligations payable to FMI of $13,840,889. The Corporation retained management control that gave it unilateral control over GSD, including enjoying some of the financial rewards as well as some of the exposure to future losses of GSD. The Corporation determined that GSD was a variable interest entity, of which Gyrodyne was the primary beneficiary, and therefore GSD had been consolidated in our financial statements. The terms of the mortgage debt match the terms of the mortgage debt acquired in December 2012 and January 2013 from the original lenders as these mortgages were assumed internally for legal purposes and continued to be recorded and valid for all of 2014 with the intercompany balances eliminated. GSD&#8217;s net assets were excluded from stockholders equity attributable to the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders. In addition, GSD&#8217;s net losses were excluded from the net losses attributable to the Corporation. GSD was generally treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes so long as 90 percent of its gross income is &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. &#8220;Qualifying income&#8221; includes real property rents and gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property held for sale to customers as described in section 1221 (a)(1)). If GSD failed to meet this requirement it may have been taxable as a corporation.

&#160;

&#160; 

Equity Financing 

&#160; 

On March 6, 2015, the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a rights offering to the Corporation&#8217;s existing shareholders. On April 10, 2015 and May 15, 2015, the Corporation filed amendments to the registration statement to replace the financial statements and related financial information in the original filing of the registration statement with the updated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 and as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively and other updated financial information related thereto. The Corporation&#8217;s Board believed that the rights offering would facilitate the vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares needed under New York law to approve the proposed Merger. Given the small size of holdings of many shareholders of the Corporation and the nature of various holders, the Corporation believed many holders may not have paid enough attention to the Merger to exercise their right to vote during 2014. The Board believed that shareholders who exercised their subscription rights in the rights offering were more likely to vote their shares on the Merger proposal. 

&#160; 

On April 27, 2015, the Corporation announced that it had set May 6, 2015 as the record date for the rights offering, and that the subscription price for the rights offering would be $2.75 per share. In the rights offering, the Corporation distributed, at no charge, to shareholders as of the record date non-transferable subscription rights to purchase, on a three-for-two basis, up to an aggregate of 2,224,020 shares of Gyrodyne common stock. 

&#160; 

On May 18, 2015, the SEC declared the registration statement effective, and on May 19, 2015, the Corporation announced the commencement of the rights offering. The Corporation effected the rights offering through the distribution of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase shares of its common stock at $2.75 per share subject to certain aggregate ownership limitations. In the rights offering, shareholders received three subscription rights for each two shares of common stock held of record on May 6, 2015, with each subscription right giving a shareholder the right to purchase one share of common stock. The rights offering also included an over-subscription privilege, which entitled each rights holder that exercised its basic subscription privilege in full, the right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering, subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising this over-subscription right. The rights offering did not contain an overallotment option. 

&#160; 

On June 17, 2015, the Corporation closed the rights offering and on June 22, 2015 the Corporation announced that it received subscriptions for approximately 7,044,894 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 2,224,020. Shareholders were allocated 100% of their basic subscriptions. Based on the maximum 2,224,020 shares that were issuable in the rights offering, 1,214,644 shares were allocated to shareholders who properly exercised their oversubscription privilege, pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of shares subscribed for under the over-subscription privilege, or 20.12499% of each over-subscriber&#8217;s requested shares. The rights offering resulted in 2,224,020 common shares issued on June 26, 2015 and net proceeds received (after expenses) of $5,606,190 (Gross proceeds of $6,116,055 less direct expenses of the rights offering of $509,865). 

&#160; 

Dividend N ote 

&#160; 

The transfer of the properties by Gyrodyne to GSD resulted in the recognition of approximately $28.4 million of capital gain income by Gyrodyne in 2013. Giving effect to offsetting deductions, we determined that Gyrodyne would have approximately $18 million in REIT income for 2013. In order to satisfy applicable REIT distribution requirements, on December 20, 2013 we declared an additional dividend, payable on January 31, 2014 to the Corporation&#8217;s shareholders of record as of December 31, 2013. This dividend was paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global subordinated dividend note due June 30, 2017 aggregating $16,150,000 ($10.89 per share) in principal amount. The Dividend Note carried interest at 5.0% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2014, and was paid in the form of additional notes. 

&#160; 

On June 16, 2014, the initial semi-annual interest payment on the Dividend Note was paid in kind in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global 5% subordinated note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $302,813 that otherwise is identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On December 15, 2014, the second semi-annual interest payment on the original Dividend Note was paid in kind in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global 5% subordinated note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $403,750 that otherwise is identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. The initial interest due of $7,570 on the note issued on June 16, 2014 was paid in cash on December 15, 2014. 

&#160; 

On September 15, 2014, our Board declared a special supplemental dividend in the amount of $682,033 or $0.46 per share. The dividend was paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note on December 31, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2014. The terms of the note are identical to the original Dividend Note other than the face value of the note and the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. The dividend was intended to prevent the imposition of federal corporate income tax on Gyrodyne&#8217;s undistributed 2013 REIT taxable income. 

&#160; 

On June 15, 2015, the third semi-annual interest payment on the original Dividend Note was paid in kind in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a global 5% subordinated note due June 30, 2017 in the principal amount of $403,750 that otherwise is identical to the Dividend Note other than as to the initial semi-annual interest payment date thereunder. The interest due of $7,570 on the note issued on June 16, 2014 and $10,094 on the note issued December 15, 2014, as well as, the interest of $15,630 due on the Dividend Note issued December 31, 2014 was paid in cash on June 15, 2015. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Plan of Merger, the dividend notes were exchanged for equity in Gyrodyne LLC, effective August 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Leasing Activity 

&#160; 

New Leases and Renewals: 

&#160; 

During 2015, the Company signed five new leases comprising annual base rent of approximately $181,000, excluding tenant reimbursements, at an average rate per square foot of $14.43, which were offset by eighteen terminations comprising $435,000 in annual revenue, excluding tenant reimbursements at an average rate per square foot of $18.90. The net impact was a decrease in annual lease commitments and rented square footage of approximately $254,000 and 11,000 square feet, respectively. A total of thirty-two lease renewals were signed during 2015 comprising approximately 42,000 square feet, $761,000 in annual revenue and $1,788,000 in total commitments. Additionally, we entered into three expansions with existing tenants resulting in an increase of approximately 2,600 square feet, annual revenue of $50,000 and total lease commitments of $716,000. 

&#160; 

Medical Parks &#8211; During 2015, we entered into one new lease in our medical parks encompassing approximately 2,600 square feet, $64,000 in annual rent and total lease commitments over the term of such leases of approximately $319,000. We also renewed eleven leases comprising approximately 15,000 square feet, $447,000 in annual revenues and total lease commitments of approximately $1,285,000. There were two lease expansions in the medical parks during 2015 encompassing approximately 1,900 square feet, $47,000 in annual revenues and $712,000 in total lease commitments. 

&#160; 

Industrial Park &#8211; During 2015, we entered into four new leases in the Flowerfield industrial park encompassing approximately 10,000 square feet and $117,000 in annual revenue and total lease commitments of approximately $859,000. We also renewed twenty-one leases comprising approximately 26,000 square feet, $314,000 in annual revenue and total lease commitments of approximately $503,000. There was one expansion signed comprising approximately 600 square feet, $3,000 in annual revenue and $3,000 in total lease commitments. 

&#160; 

Lease Terminations/Defaults - There were nine lease terminations in our medical parks comprising approximately 13,000 square feet and $304,000 in annual revenues. Additionally, our industrial park experienced nine lease terminations comprising approximately 10,000 square feet and $131,000 of annual revenue. 

&#160; 

There was one tenant default in the medical parks comprising approximately 600 square feet and a reduction of $17,000 in annual revenue. There were two defaults in the industrial park which resulted in terminations comprising approximately 2,000 square feet and a reduction of $26,000 in annual revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Retention Bonus Plan 

&#160; 

In September 2013, the Corporation&#8217;s Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to pursue the actual disposition of the Corporation&#8217;s remaining assets and to complete the Corporation&#8217;s tax liquidation by means of the proposed merger of the Corporation and GSD with and into Gyrodyne, LLC, if approved and consummated. Following the proposed merger, Gyrodyne, LLC would operate with a business plan to dispose of the Contributed Properties, and any other assets, in each case in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets. Accordingly, in May 2014, the Board authorized a Retention Bonus Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) designed to recognize the nature and scope of the responsibilities related to such business plan, to reward and incent performance in connection therewith, to align the interests of directors, executives and employees with our shareholders and to retain such persons during the term of such plan. The Plan provides for bonuses to directors and discretionary bonuses to officers and employees determined by the gross sales proceeds from the sale of each property and the date of sale. 

&#160; 

The Plan consists of a bonus pool funded with an amount equal to 5% of the specific appraised value of each of the Contributed Properties (set forth in the Plan), so long as the gross selling price of a property is equal to or greater than 100% of its appraised value (based on appraisals utilized to support the value of the real estate included in the non-cash dividend distributed on December 30, 2013). Additional funding of the bonus pool will occur on a property-by-property basis when the gross sales price of a property is in excess of its appraised value as follows: 10% on the first 10% of appreciation, 15% on the next 10% of appreciation and 20% on appreciation greater than 20%. Furthermore, if a specified property is sold on or before a designated date specified in the Plan, an additional amount equal to 2% of the gross selling price of such property also is funded into the bonus pool. 

&#160; 

The bonus pool is distributable in the following proportions to the named participants in the bonus plan for so long as they are directors or employees of Gyrodyne, LLC: 15% for the Chairman, 50% for the directors other than the Chairman (10% for each of the other five directors) and 35% (the &#8220;Employee Pool&#8221;) for the Company&#8217;s executives and employees. Such share of the bonus pool is earned only upon the completion of the sale of a property at a gross selling price equal to or greater than its appraised value and is paid to the named beneficiaries of the Plan or their designees within 60 days of the completion of such sale or, if later, within 60 days of receipt of any subsequent post-completion installment payment related to such sale. All allocations to individual beneficiaries of the Employee Pool shall be determined by the Board of the Company or in consultation with its President. 

&#160; 

Although no retention bonus payments were distributed in 2015, the Company has accrued the amount attributable under the Plan with respect to the sale of 5 Medical Drive, Port Jefferson. To achieve the highest sale value, the Company has concluded to sell the buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as individual units versus a single transaction. Bonuses have been earned on the sale of 5 Medical Drive, however, the Board has decided that payment should not be made until all ten buildings are sold and the measurement of such bonuses should be based on the combined appraisal of all ten buildings versus measuring them based on the individual building appraisals. The Compensation Committee concluded that this is in the best interest of the shareholders as it avoids a potential scenario where the Company might pay bonuses for values in excess of the appraisal on some buildings and proceeds from the subsequent sale of other buildings were below the appraised values on those buildings. 

&#160; 

The Merger 

&#160; 

On August 20, 2015 the shareholders of the Corporation voted to authorize the Merger with more than 99% of votes cast at the special meeting voting in favor, representing more than 76% of all outstanding shares.

The Merger completed the tax plan of liquidation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and resulted in holders of common stock of the Corporation receiving approximately 22.6% (335,086 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.0904 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per share of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock), holders of non-transferable Notes receiving approximately 30.0% (444,804 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.024798 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per $1.00 principal amount of the Dividend Notes issued in January 2014 and the Dividend Notes issued in December 2014, together, in each case, with any interest thereon paid in kind in the form of additional Notes), and holders of non-transferable interests in GSD receiving approximately 47.4% (702,790 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.473999 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per GSD interest).

On February 4, 2016 the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell the Fairfax Medical Center, as amended, for a sales price of $14,315,000 to JAG Associates, L.L.C., a Virginia limited liability company. The material terms of the agreement provide for: (i) an initial earnest money deposit in the amount of $250,000 payable by JAG to the escrow agent within five business days following the effective date that will be applied to the purchase price at closing; (ii) an evaluation period that will expire on April 11, 2016, during which time JAG shall have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice to the Company, for any reason or no reason, prior to the expiration of the evaluation period, in which case JAG will have the right to receive a refund of its initial $250,000 earnest money deposit; (iii) if the agreement is not terminated on or prior to April 11, 2016, JAG will be obligated to deliver an additional earnest money deposit to the escrow agent in the amount of $250,000, which together with the initial earnest money deposit will be applied toward the purchase price at closing; (iv) unless JAG terminates the agreement on or prior to April 11, 2016, the closing shall occur on or before May 4, 2016. The agreement also contains a master lease (2 year term for approximately 4,700 square feet) to Gyrodyne for approximately $210,000 due quarterly if certain vacancies are not re-tenanted. The Company is actively marketing the space, the success of which will directly reduce the master lease obligation.

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We focus our business strategy of maximizing the intrinsic value per share through aligning our operating and investment strategy with our goal of executing on a tax efficient liquidity event or series of tax efficient liquidity events. During the third quarter of 2015, the Corporation completed within the two year deadline the tax plan of liquidation by completing the Merger of GSD and the Corporation with and into Gyrodyne, LLC, thereby ensuring the prior 2013 and 2014 distributions and future distributions were and will continue to be done in a tax efficient manner. Our strategy going forward is to seek the opportunistic sale of our properties, albeit without the timing constraints that existed prior to the completion of the Corporation&#8217;s tax liquidation, which may include value enhancements of our Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. To accomplish this, the Company&#8217;s plan will consist of: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

managing the real estate portfolio to improve operating cash flow while simultaneously increasing the market values of the underlying operating properties; 

&#160; &#9679; 

managing the opportunistic sale of certain properties; 

&#160; &#9679; 

pursuing the re-zoning/entitlement efforts of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value; &#160; &#9679;

balancing working capital and funds available for the development process with making distributions during the liquidation process. 

&#160;

The completion of the Corporation&#8217;s tax liquidation by means of the Merger removes the timing constraints associated with the tax liquidation and now provides Gyrodyne the opportunity to pursue without such constraints the opportunistic disposition of certain properties and the enhancement of the value of Flowerfield, and Cortlandt Manor, by pursuing various development or zoning opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the values for those properties. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common interests. We are unable to predict the precise nature, amount or timing of such distributions. 

&#160; 

Sales of properties, by Gyrodyne could take the form of individual sales of assets, as has been our recent experience in Port Jefferson, sales of groups of assets organized by business, type of asset or otherwise, a single sale of all or substantially all of the assets, or some other form of sale. The assets may be sold to one or more purchasers in one or more transactions over a period of time. 

&#160; 

A sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company would require shareholder approval under New York law. However, in the event of the sale of the individual properties, it is not required or anticipated that any shareholder votes will be solicited with respect to the approval of the specific terms of any particular sales of assets approved by Gyrodyne&#8217;s Board. The prices at which the various assets may be sold depends largely on factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the condition of financial markets, the availability of financing to prospective purchasers of the assets, U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals, public market perceptions, and limitations on transferability of certain assets. 

&#160; &#160; 

Assuming the completion of the liquidation of Gyrodyne takes until 2018, and giving effect to its estimated cash flow from operation of its existing properties until their sale, the Company expects Gyrodyne would have a cash balance of approximately $43.5 million, prior to any future dividend distributions. Such cash would equate to future post-merger liquidating distribution of $29.31 per share based on the post merged surviving company, Gyrodyne LLC, having 1,482,680 common interests outstanding. 

&#160;

The aforementioned estimated distributions do not include the anticipated return on investment from the land development costs the Company estimates will be incurred during the next two years which approximates $3.15 million. The Company believes the return on the investment could be substantial, however under the applicable accounting guidance, the uncertainties that impact the achievable value which include but not limited to, re-zoning success, entitlement grants, future value of the real estate under such anticipated zone changes and entitlements and other factors do not allow the Company to disclose estimated values derived from these investments. 

&#160; 

Pursuit of re-zoning/entitlement efforts of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Properties 

&#160; 

Land Development: 

The Company is pursuing various options to maximize the total distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process. Prior to the Merger, GSD did not have sufficient liquidity to effectively pursue the highest and best use zoning/entitlements of the Cortlandt Manor and Flowerfield properties. Following the rights offering and Merger, the Company believes it possesses sufficient liquidity to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through the pursuit of the highest and best use zoning/entitlements. During the calendar year 2015, the Company incurred approximately $464,000 of land development costs, most of which were incurred during the fourth quarter. The Company estimates that it may incur approximately $3.15 million in additional charges over the next two years to continue enhancement efforts, including the pursuit of entitlements inclusive of zoning changes and special permits. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company does not intend to develop the properties but rather to focus resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction value. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. In addition, the Company may entertain joint ventures or other types of relationships for the properties which might provide funds for earlier distributions to shareholders while simultaneously providing enhancements to the underlying values of the properties. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is uncertain, the Company believes the return on the estimated investment of $3.15 million will serve to increase the estimated distributions versus selling the properties with their current zoning and entitlements. 

&#160; 

Cortlandt Manor Development: 

On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the &#8220;Town&#8221;) adopted its 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) of which one key strategy is the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District (&#8220;MOD&#8221;) . The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town&#8217;s existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development , including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian&#8217;s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For the past several months the Company and its planning consultants have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD. With the Plan and the MOD now approved, we believe the funds being expended by the Company in this effort will be justified through enhancing the value of this property as we move to its eventual disposition. 

&#160; 

Flowerfield Development: &#160; 

Similar to our efforts in the Town of Cortlandt, we are working closely with engineers and consultants on market research and related feasibility studies to identify how we can maximize Flowerfield&#8217;s value through a highest and best use approach. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown to seek out potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies which may not currently fall within our &#8220;as of right to build&#8221; zoning . We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, re-zoning or other concessions that would allow for any such development projects currently not permitted within existing development constraints. Such changes could eventually lead to a number of different development plans ranging from single family or age restricted housing to condominiums or other forms of real estate developments in support of the needs of an expanding Stony Brook University and its affiliated medical school and hospital. 

&#160;

In the region surrounding Flowerfield, Stony Brook University serves as an economic engine through capital investment and growth in employment, including high paying positions in the fields of science and medicine. However, adequate housing, both on and off campus, remains a challenge. While construction is nearing completion on the University&#8217;s campus for additional dormitory rooms, our initial research indicates further supply is needed at several levels - undergraduate, graduate, physician, interns, family and visiting professors. In addition, unlike many universities around the country, Stony Brook lacks a campus-focused center around which many university-related social and professional activities are conducted. Other options might be along the lines of a continuum of care or stand-alone assisted living or nursing facilities, which we believe would be in demand given Long Island&#8217;s senior community&#8217;s increasing needs for such services. Although there can be no assurances, we believe these investments intended to enhance Flowerfield&#8217;s value will result in higher sale proceeds, similar to our expenditures intended to enhance Cortlandt Manor&#8217;s potential value.
