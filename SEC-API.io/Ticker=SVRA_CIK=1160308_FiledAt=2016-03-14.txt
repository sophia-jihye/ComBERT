Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases with significant unmet needs. We have built our product pipeline through the strategic acquisition of privately-held companies with clinical-stage assets and we currently are focused on developing new therapies for sickle cell disease, a chronic, genetic disorder classified as a rare, or orphan, disease in the United States and European Union, and for heart failure, a condition with a high unmet need for innovative treatment options. 

We are leveraging our Molecular Adhesion &#38; Sealant Technology, or MAST, platform, derived from over two decades of clinical, nonclinical, and manufacturing experience with purified and non-purified poloxamers, to develop vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188), our lead product candidate. Vepoloxamer has demonstrated multiple pharmacologic effects that may provide clinical benefit in a wide range of diseases and conditions typically characterized by impaired microvascular blood flow and/or damaged cell membranes. We initially focused on development of vepoloxamer for sickle cell disease and recently completed enrollment in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. 

Our Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease, known as the EPIC study, completed patient enrollment in February 2016 and we expect to report top-line data in the second quarter of 2016. The primary objective of the EPIC study is to demonstrate that vepoloxamer reduces the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, a severely painful, debilitating, and recurring condition for which patients are hospitalized on average four to five days. An estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people in the United States have sickle cell disease and there are between 80,000 to 100,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S. related to vaso-occlusive crisis and no approved treatment option for patients in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. to shorten the duration or reduce the severity of a crisis once underway. Treatment centers for sickle cell patients are concentrated in a relatively small number of metropolitan areas in the U.S. and European Union (EU) and, as a result, we believe we can use a small, focused sales force to effectively commercialize our product in the U.S. and EU, if approved. Vepoloxamer has orphan drug designation in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Vepoloxamer also is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF, also known as systolic heart failure or heart failure with reduced systolic function. Nonclinical studies of vepoloxamer in an animal model of advanced heart failure suggest that vepoloxamer can directly improve left ventricle contractile function by restoring cardiomyocyte membrane integrity, which can be expected to minimize calcium overload injury and improve cardiomyocyte survival. Our ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study in which we plan to enroll approximately 150 patients, is evaluating a new formulation of vepoloxamer for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. In this study, vepoloxamer is being administered over three hours in an outpatient setting, with the intention of helping to demonstrate vepoloxamer&#8217;s practical utility for chronic heart failure patients. In addition, we have filed provisional patent applications claiming a new composition of matter and uses for the new formulation of vepoloxamer being tested in the study. 

Our second product candidate, AIR001, is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, also known as diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved systolic function. Data show there are approximately 5.7 million individuals with heart failure in the U.S. and that approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for heart failure have HFpEF. In February 2016, we announced positive top-line results from a 30-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a study of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF. The study met its pre-specified primary endpoint, with the AIR001 treatment group showing a statistically significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise compared to the control group. Another investigator-sponsored Phase 2a study of AIR001 is ongoing and we anticipate interim data on a cohort of patients in May 2016. In addition, we are supporting a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 2 study of AIR001 in HFpEF designed by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network (HFN) and sponsored by its Coordinating Center. The HFN is made up of premier clinical centers located across North America and was established to expedite clinical research on treatments and strategies to improve the management of acute and chronic heart failure. The Phase 2 study, known as the Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in HFpEF (INDIE-HFpEF) study, will enroll approximately 100 patients and is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2016.

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing, and in some cases commercializing, novel therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases with significant unmet needs. Near-term activities that underlie our business strategy include the following: 

&#9679; Complete the EPIC study and seek regulatory approval of vepoloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in the U.S. and EU . Our 388-patient EPIC study is the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial in sickle cell disease concluded to date. Following study conclusion and analysis of results, we plan to request one or more meetings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to help us gain alignment with the FDA on the contents and process for submission of a new drug application, or NDA, for vepoloxamer based in large part on the data from EPIC. Pending the outcome of our discussions with the FDA, assuming agreement to use the FDA&#8217;s rolling review process potentially afforded by vepoloxamer&#8217;s fast track designation for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease, we plan to submit portions of the NDA for vepoloxamer beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and complete the submission in the first quarter of 2017. We currently are planning for a six-month NDA review period following the FDA&#8217;s filing decision, based on receiving a priority review designation. Concurrently with FDA review of our NDA, we intend to seek advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on submission of a Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, for vepoloxamer. Pending the outcome of those discussions, we currently plan to submit a MAA for vepoloxamer in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

&#9679; Independently commercialize vepoloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in the U.S. and EU . We intend to independently commercialize vepoloxamer, if approved, in the U.S. and EU. Data show that in the U.S. about 500 hospitals located in a relatively small number of metropolitan areas serve nearly 80% of sickle cell patients treated for vaso-occlusive crisis, and, in the EU, more than 50% of sickle cell patients reside in the United Kingdom and France, with most patients concentrated in the London and Paris metropolitan areas. Given this market concentration, we plan to build our own highly-focused hospital sales force of approximately 30 representatives and, assuming vepoloxamer receives FDA approval in the third quarter of 2017, launch in the U.S. by the end of 2017. We plan to hire approximately 10 additional sales representatives for the EU if vepoloxamer is approved by the EMA and would anticipate a 2018 launch in that territory. For additional discussion, see &#8220;Commercialization Strategy&#8221; below. 

&#9679; Advance clinical development of vepoloxamer in heart failure . As described above, we believe vepoloxamer may offer a new therapeutic approach for patients with heart failure and believe that our ongoing Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in patients with chronic heart failure will help define the potential clinical utility of vepoloxamer for treatment of heart failure patients. 

&#9679; Advance clinical development of AIR001 in HFpEF . Results from prior clinical studies of AIR001, demonstrating decreases in right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, as well as improvements observed in pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac lusitrophy, support the potential benefit of AIR001 treatment for HFpEF patients and we plan to continue to advance its development in HFpEF. We anticipate interim data from a second investigator-sponsored Phase 2a study in HFpEF patients in May 2016. In addition, the HFN&#8217;s INDIE-HFpEF study of AIR001 in approximately 100 patients is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2016. The HFN is recognized for robust enrollment in heart failure clinical trials and high scientific productivity and we expect this study to define the potential efficacy of AIR001 for the treatment of HFpEF. 

Vepoloxamer

Vepoloxamer is purified poloxamer 188, a nonionic, block copolymer comprised of a central linear chain of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked on both sides by linear hydrophilic polyoxyethylene chains. As discussed further below, we believe that for patient safety reasons, it is important to clearly identify and distinguish vepoloxamer from non-purified poloxamers. Drug products with non-purified poloxamer 188 as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, may have serious toxicity consequences and should not be substituted for or confused with drug products containing purified poloxamer 188. Accordingly, we sought a unique generic name from the United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council, and USAN subsequently assigned &#8220;vepoloxamer&#8221; as the unique generic name for purified poloxamer 188.

Studies have shown that vepoloxamer&#8217;s mechanism of action is biophysical and driven by its ability to modulate cell membrane surface tension. Its hydrophobic polyoxypropylene core is believed to adhere to hydrophobic domains exposed on damaged cell membranes, restoring membrane integrity and reducing surface tensions that otherwise promote pathological adhesive interactions. Data suggest vepoloxamer does not interact with healthy cell membranes, which have a hydrophilic exterior surface. As the damaged area of the cell membrane repairs, vepoloxamer is removed from the cell surface and ultimately is excreted from the body, unchanged, primarily in the urine. 

&#160;

&#160;

We are leveraging the MAST platform to develop vepoloxamer. Vepoloxamer is manufactured through a proprietary supercritic al fluid extraction purification process applied to poloxamer 188. As described below, vepoloxamer was designed to preserve the activity of poloxamer 188, but eliminate certain impurities and other substances that we believe were the cause of the acute ren al dysfunction observed in clinical studies of poloxamer 188 (non-purified) conducted by a prior sponsor. 

The MAST Platform

The MAST platform describes the repository of both proprietary (to us) and non-proprietary poloxamer-related data, know-how, and other information that has been developed over the course of several decades by numerous sponsors, most recently by us. It reflects the accumulated knowledge of over 100 pharmacology studies, more than 15 clinical studies in multiple indications in which over 2,500 subjects have been exposed to poloxamer 188 or vepoloxamer, and experience manufacturing and purifying poloxamers. This knowledge, and those aspects that are proprietary to us in particular, provide us with unique insight into the mechanism of action of, and areas of potential clinical benefit with, vepoloxamer. 

We believe the MAST platform provides us with key benefits as we develop vepoloxamer, including the ability to leverage existing data for its development in new indications and to protect the market for our products, if approved, not only through patent coverage but manufacturing-related trade secrets. For example, proof-of-concept in pharmacologic studies or experimental models has been demonstrated in a wide range of diseases and conditions and, for most new indications we pursue, we believe we will not need to re-conduct many of the preclinical activities that consume substantial time and resources in drug development (e.g., IND-enabling toxicology, pharmacokinetic, absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion studies). By leveraging already-completed pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical activities and safety data from the more than 2,500 subjects that have received poloxamer 188 or vepoloxamer in more than 15 clinical studies, we can focus on later-stage, higher-value activities, as well as save time and money (both in terms of the costs to conduct these activities and by maintaining a more streamlined infrastructure). In addition, unlike discrete small molecules, polymers (including vepoloxamer) are molecularly diverse; that is, polymers contain chemical species with varying structural characteristics. This molecule diversity makes polymers difficult to characterize, both chemically and physically. Without access to our testing methods and acceptance criteria for starting material and in-process and release specifications, and other know-how which we protect as trade secrets, generic and other follow-on manufacturers may be unable to adequately characterize products that are equivalent to vepoloxamer in the manner that regulatory agencies will require. As a result, we believe that generic and other follow-on manufacturers will be required to invest in and take the time to conduct large clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their follow-on products. We also are evaluating the development of a proprietary process for manufacturing API starting material, which we expect would further protect the markets for our vepoloxamer products, if approved.

Mechanism of Action 

The cell membrane is comprised primarily of phospholipids, which form the fundamental structure of the cell membrane&#8209;&#8209; the phospholipid bilayer. This structure is critical to living cells because it forms a selectively-permeable barrier between the aqueous environments of the cell interior and exterior. The exterior surface of healthy cell membranes normally is hydrophilic. When a cell membrane is damaged, the interior hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer become exposed. 

The cell membrane serves many functions, but one of its primary roles is to regulate the passage of ions and large molecules into and out of the cell and, in particular, to maintain critical transmembrane ion concentrations. Damaged cell membranes can result in unregulated diffusion of ions between the intracellular and extracellular environments. The integrity of a cell membrane can be compromised by chemical agents (e.g., air pollutants, free radicals, poisons), physical trauma (e.g., electric shock, frostbite, radiation, thermal burns, hypovolemia) and disease. Cells have endogenous mechanisms for membrane repair, but membrane injury can exceed the cell&#8217;s natural repair capacity. If the damage is not repaired, cell ion pumps become overwhelmed and subsequently deplete the cell&#8217;s energy stores, leading to cell death. 

After intravenous administration, vepoloxamer&#8217;s hydrophobic polyoxypropylene core is believed to adhere to hydrophobic domains on cell membranes, which, as described above, become exposed when the membrane is damaged. At sites of adhesion, it physically occupies the available area, minimizing or preventing other hydrophobic adhesive interactions, while displacing water and causing lipid molecules to pack more tightly, effectively &#8220;sealing&#8221; the damaged area and arresting unchecked transport of ions across the membrane. Vepoloxamer does not bond covalently with the cell membrane and the adhesive interaction is reversible. When membrane phospholipid density is normalized, vepoloxamer is displaced from the cell membrane and returns to circulation where it is cleared through normal excretion pathways as described below under &#8220;Safety.&#8221; While vepoloxamer adheres specifically to hydrophobic domains, these domains may be widespread in sick or injured patients. As a result, vepoloxamer&#8217;s activity broadly targets hydrophobic domains, without regard to the cause of the underlying damage, and, as described below, simultaneously may resolve multiple pathophysiologic processes. At the same time, vepoloxamer has demonstrated little or no affinity for hydrophilic domains and, thus, does not interact with healthy cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

Pharmacodynamics 

Vepoloxamer is believed to exert multiple pharmacologic effects as a result of its adhesion to hydrophobic domains. 

&#9679; Hemorheologic . In nonclinical studies as well as in a sub-study of the Phase 3 study of vepoloxamer in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis discussed below, vepoloxamer demonstrated that it improved blood flow, particularly in the microcirculation where the vast majority of oxygen and nutrient exchange occurs, and improved blood flow can be expected to improve tissue perfusion (and reperfusion following ischemia). Vepoloxamer is believed to impede the aggregation of red blood cells, or RBCs, by inhibiting the fibrin/fibrinogen cross-bridges that form between RBCs, causing them to aggregate. Since RBCs traverse microcapillaries in &#8220;single file,&#8221; the presence in the circulation of RBC aggregates can significantly impair microvascular blood flow. Inhibiting RBC aggregation also reduces blood viscosity, allowing it to flow more readily, particularly in the low shear environment of the microcirculation. The anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic/pro-fibrinolytic properties described below also contribute to improved blood flow. 

&#9679; Cytoprotective . Vepoloxamer may protect cells by interrupting the pathological cascade associated with cell membrane dysfunction and the resulting unregulated diffusion of ions across the membrane. This cytoprotective effect provides time for the cell&#8217;s natural repair mechanisms to restore the cell to normal functioning, of importance during reperfusion, when viable but damaged cells may not survive the oxidative stress resulting from the reintroduction of oxygenated blood. 

&#9679; Anti-inflammatory . Vepoloxamer may inhibit adhesion of circulating blood cells to the endothelium by competing for and physically occupying hydrophobic domains on vessel walls, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels, provide a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulate the movement of water and dissolved materials between the blood and tissues. The initial step in the inflammatory cascade is adhesion of white blood cells to the endothelium. By blocking adhesive interactions between white blood cells and the vessel wall, vepoloxamer may help prevent an inflammatory process from beginning. 

&#9679; Antithrombotic/pro-fibrinolytic . Vepoloxamer may help reduce the pro-thrombotic state that may result from disease or injury. A thrombus, or blood clot, results from aggregation of platelets and clotting factors. Platelet activation, triggered by damage to a vessel wall, causes a cascade of further platelet activation eventually leading to formation of a thrombus. Disease or injury may cause this normal response to turn pathologic, leading to thrombosis, where the thrombus grows to the point of obstructing the flow of blood through the occluded vessel. Studies suggest that vepoloxamer inhibits weak platelet-activation stimuli (e.g., shear activation of platelets) and release of adenosine di-phosphate from RBCs, minimizing the self-perpetuating response that leads to thrombosis. However, vepoloxamer does not inhibit strong platelet-activation stimuli (e.g., platelet/receptor interactions directly at the endothelium). Accordingly, we believe vepoloxamer does not negatively affect normal hemostatic function, which is supported by data from multiple nonclinical studies. Further, vepoloxamer may facilitate fibrinolysis, the body&#8217;s natural process of dissolving a thrombus. Vepoloxamer adheres to fibrin monomers during clot formation, making them larger and more readily degraded by plasmin, the endogenous fibrinolytic enzyme that dissolves formed clots. 

Clinical Application 

We believe the pharmacodynamic properties of vepoloxamer enable it simultaneously to address, or prevent activation of, multiple biochemical pathways that are central to the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases. The microcirculation is responsible for the delivery of blood through the smallest blood vessels (arterioles and capillaries) embedded within tissues. A healthy endothelium is critical to a functional microcirculation. Without the regular delivery of blood and transfer of oxygen to tissue from the microcirculation, individual cells (in both the endothelium and tissue) are unable to maintain aerobic metabolism and, through a series of complex and interrelated events, eventually die. If the microcirculatory insufficiency continues, the individual will suffer tissue necrosis, organ damage, and eventually, death. 

Treatment with vepoloxamer can be expected to be most clinically impactful in diseases where improving microcirculatory insufficiency is central to improving clinical outcomes. Vepoloxamer may also have clinical utility in diseases where damaged cell membranes are unable to prevent the unregulated passage of calcium leading to calcium overload toxicity. Vepoloxamer has shown effectiveness in experimental models of heart failure and stroke. Poloxamer 188 has shown effectiveness in experimental models of hemorrhagic shock, muscular dystrophy, bypass surgery, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, spinal cord injury, amniotic fluid embolism, acute ischemic bowel disease and burns. 

&#160;

&#160;

Safety 

As described above, vepoloxamer has little or no affinity for undamaged, hydrophilic domains and, thus, has no measurable interaction with healthy cells and tissues. In addition, the carbon/oxygen ether bonds that comprise the vepoloxamer backbone generally are accepted as insusceptible to metabolic pathways in humans. Thus, following administration, essentially all of the drug is recovered, unchanged, in the urine. A small amount is recovered in fecal biliary excretion, presumably following uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. The lack of metabolic breakdown and elimination by normal excretion pathways reduces concern over active metabolites driving unintended toxicities. 

The safety of poloxamer 188 (both purified and non-purified) has been evaluated in more than 15 clinical studies in multiple indications in which over 2,500 subjects have received active drug. In these studies, it was generally well-tolerated, with the exception of renal toxicities associated with poloxamer 188 ( non-purified ); in particular, in a 2,950-patient, randomized, controlled study in acute myocardial infarction conducted by Burroughs Wellcome (now, GlaxoSmithKline), referred to as the CORE study. The therapeutic potential of non-purified poloxamer 188 was and is limited by these renal toxicities. A series of nonclinical studies conducted after the CORE study identified low molecular weight substances generated during the chemical process by which the poloxamer is synthesized that were associated with renal dysfunction. We believe these substances were primarily responsible for the acute renal dysfunction observed in clinical studies of poloxamer 188, including the CORE study, and are a principal reason why clinical development of poloxamer 188 was discontinued by Burroughs Wellcome. 

To address the renal toxicity associated with poloxamer 188, a proprietary manufacturing and purification process was developed to remove certain low molecular weight substances present in poloxamer 188. In nonclinical studies, compared to poloxamer 188, vepoloxamer resulted in less accumulation in kidney tissue, lower levels of serum creatinine, less vacuolization of proximal tubular epithelium, and more rapid recovery from vacuolar lesions. No difference was observed in the efficacy of vepoloxamer compared to poloxamer 188. 

In the seven clinical studies of vepoloxamer completed before the EPIC study, including the 255-patient, Phase 3 study in sickle cell disease known as Study C97-1248, which is discussed in more detail below, vepoloxamer was generally well-tolerated. Transient elevations in liver enzymes have been observed, though in each case levels returned to baseline during the follow-up period, except in subjects whose liver enzymes had been elevated at baseline. Importantly, in contrast to the acute renal dysfunction observed with poloxamer 188 (non-purified) in prior studies, including the CORE study, the effects on serum creatinine reported as adverse events among subjects who received vepoloxamer were comparable to those among subjects who received placebo. 

Additionally, our thorough QT/QTc clinical study of vepoloxamer, or the TQT study, met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that, based on analysis of electrocardiograms, vepoloxamer did not have an adverse effect on cardiac repolarization, as measured by prolongation of the QT interval. Sixty four healthy volunteers received vepoloxamer and it was generally well-tolerated at both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. The TQT study was a four-period, four-arm, crossover design, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial for the evaluation of the effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic single-dose vepoloxamer on the QT/QTc intervals. No clinically significant elevations in creatinine were noted in any vepoloxamer arm.

Vepoloxamer &#8211; Phase 3 Product Candidate for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease

Overview of Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is an inherited genetic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S., where it is estimated to affect approximately 90,000 to 100,000 people. The annual cost of medical care in the U.S. for patients with sickle cell disease is estimated to exceed $1.0 billion. 

Sickle cell disease is characterized by the &#8220;sickling&#8221; of red blood cells, which normally are disc-shaped, deformable and move easily through the microvasculature carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Sickled, or crescent-shaped, red blood cells, on the other hand, are rigid and sticky and tend to adhere to each other and the walls of blood vessels (the vascular endothelium). 

The hallmark of the disease is recurring episodes of severe pain commonly known as sickle cell crisis or vaso-occlusive crisis. Vaso-occlusive crisis occurs when the proportion of sickled cells rises, leading to obstruction of small blood vessels and reduced blood flow to organs and bone marrow. This obstruction results in intense pain and tissue damage, including necrosis (tissue death). The frequency, severity and duration of these acute crises can vary considerably. Frequency may range from infrequent to more than monthly and duration is typically four to five days and may last a week or longer. Over a lifetime, the accumulated burden of damaged tissue frequently results in the loss of vital organ function and a greatly reduced lifespan. The average age of death of an individual with sickle cell disease is around 45 years. 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to vaso-occlusive crises, sickle cell patients can suffer many additional complications, including: acute chest syndrome, a respiratory distress syndrome that may arise in the course of an acute crisis; stroke, including silent stroke, which can result from a progressive narrowing of blood vessels, preventing oxygen from reaching the brain; pulmonary hypertension an d heart failure; kidney dysfunction and chronic renal failure; bone necrosis of the hip and other major joints; frequent infections due to loss of splenic function and decreased immune function; leg ulcers; blindness; increased rate of complications from p regnancy; and chronic deep muscle and bone pain, even in the absence of acute vaso-occlusive pain. 

Significant Unmet Need 

Based on data available from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) group of databases, we estimate that there are approximately 80,000 to 100,000 hospitalizations related to vaso-occlusive crisis in the U.S. each year. In addition, although the number is difficult to measure, we estimate that the number of untreated vaso-occlusive crisis events is substantial and in the hundreds of thousands in the U.S. each year. If vepoloxamer is approved and as people with sickle cell disease are made aware of the new therapy, we believe that people who would otherwise suffer through a crisis at home may seek treatment. 

We are not aware of any approved therapeutic agents for shortening the duration or reducing the severity of an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis. For patients experiencing a vaso-occlusive crisis, treatment typically consists of hydration, oxygen and analgesia for pain, usually using narcotics. By improving microvascular blood flow and reducing tissue ischemia, vepoloxamer has the potential to reduce the severity and shorten the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis and improve patient outcomes. 

Vepoloxamer Clinical Development in Sickle Cell Disease

Overview 

In February 2016, we completed patient enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical study of vepoloxamer for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with in sickle cell disease, known as the EPIC study. We do not yet have results from EPIC. In prior-sponsor clinical studies, vepoloxamer was administered to 211 patients with sickle cell disease over four studies, three of which were for vaso-occlusive crisis, including the Phase 3 study known as Study C97-1248. The fourth study involved patients with acute chest syndrome. Encouraging results in early clinical studies warranted continued development. 

In these prior-sponsor studies, vepoloxamer was generally well-tolerated. Based on an integrated analysis of all four clinical studies, the majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate. The most common adverse events (incidence &#62;20%) were fever, bilirubinemia direct, pruritus, vomiting, nausea, constipation, headache, tachycardia, pain, weight loss, bilirubinemia, and anemia. The tolerability of vepoloxamer did not change significantly with increasing exposure (increasing dose and/or duration). The safety profile was similar in children (ages 18 and younger) compared to adults. In Study C97-1248, which is discussed in detail below, no difference in the overall incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events was observed between the vepoloxamer and placebo (control) groups. 

Ongoing and Planned Clinical Studies 

Phase 3 Study (EPIC) . The EPIC study was a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. We expect to report top-line data from EPIC in the second quarter of 2016. The primary objective is to demonstrate that vepoloxamer reduces the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, with the duration of crisis measured from the time a patient is randomized to the time at which the patient receives the last dose of parenteral opioid analgesic for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis prior to hospital discharge. A total of 388 patients, ages four to 46, who have sickle cell disease and were experiencing acute pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis and required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia were randomized in EPIC. Using a two-sided alpha of 0.05, the study has approximately 90% power to detect a 16-hour difference between treatment arms, assuming an average crisis duration of 96 hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation of greater than 50%. These assumptions were derived in part from proprietary analyses of the Preventing Acute Chest Syndrome by Transfusion Feasibility Study (PROACTIVE), which we believe enrolled a study population similar to that which would be enrolled in EPIC, and publicly available data on average duration of hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis. Using a two-sided alpha of 0.01, the study has approximately 85% power to detect a 24-hour difference between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints will compare the rate of re-hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis within 14 days of initial discharge from the hospital and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within 120 hours of randomization. More than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated in EPIC, with approximately two-thirds of the sites located in the U.S. The average age of patients randomized in EPIC was 15 years and patients under age 18 accounted for approximately 71% of total subjects. Approximately 61% of patients randomized in EPIC were concurrently being treated with hydroxyurea. 

&#160;

&#160;

Open-Label, Repeat-Exposure Extension Study (EPIC-E). During the second quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label, multicenter extension study known as EPIC-E to expand our existing safety database regarding repeat exposure to vepoloxamer. The study is enrolling patients who have completed the EPIC study and are hospitalized for subsequent vaso-occlusive crisis. Other objectives of the study will be to assess the rate of re-hospitalization for recurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome. 

EPIC Sub-Study . It is generally believed that the long-term morbidity and early mortality associated with sickle cell disease is the consequence of a lifetime of repeated vaso-occlusive events and the ensuing ischemic end-organ damage. In fact, organ failure is the leading cause of premature death in adults with sickle cell disease. Vepoloxamer&#8217;s hemorheologic and cytoprotective effects can be expected to improve tissue oxygenation, shorten the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis and limit the impact of each vaso-occlusive crisis that ultimately leads to end-organ dysfunction and failure. In 2014, we began enrolling patients participating in EPIC at selected U.S. study sites in a sub-study to investigate and quantify the effect of vepoloxamer on tissue oxygenation, utilizing a non-invasive, FDA-approved device, along with various biomarkers of tissue injury. At the time we completed EPIC enrollment, 22 EPIC patients had also participated in the sub-study. Although a multi-year or even multi-decade study would likely be required to demonstrate vepoloxamer&#8217;s ability to improve long-term end-organ function in sickle cell patients, by measuring its effect on tissue oxygenation and tissue injury biomarkers during a vaso-occlusive crisis, we hope to gain insight into vepoloxamer&#8217;s ability to reduce tissue damage during vaso-occlusive crisis. 

Special Population Study. To further enhance the safety database for vepoloxamer in support of our NDA submission and to help guide dosage adjustments for renally impaired patients, we are enrolling a clinical pharmacokinetics study of vepoloxamer in approximately 40 patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency. The study began in January 2016 and we expect to complete enrollment in the summer of 2016. 

Prior-Sponsor Studies in Sickle Cell Disease 

Phase 3 Study in Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (Study C97-1248). A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vepoloxamer enrolled 255 patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis. The study had initially planned to enroll 350 subjects. Signs of efficacy were observed in the primary endpoint, duration of crisis, but it did not reach statistical significance. An 8-hour decrease in the duration of crisis (approximately 132 hours in the treatment group compared to approximately 140 hours in the control group (p=0.072)) was observed in the intent-to-treat population (n=249). Notably, post hoc analyses identified a statistically significant and greater treatment effect in patients under 16 years of age. Among patients under 16 years of age (n=73), there was a 21.6-hour decrease in the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis in the treatment group compared to the control group (p=0.010), and among patients who received concomitant hydroxyurea (HU) (n=54), there was a 16-hour decrease in the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis in the treatment group compared to the control group (p=0.024). 

A potentially significant limitation of Study C97-1248 is that it did not follow subjects until crisis resolution; rather, subjects were followed for 168 hours from randomization and any subject whose crisis had not resolved by 168 hours was, for purposes of determining that patient&#8217;s duration of crisis, attributed a duration of exactly 168 hours. This truncation had a potentially significant effect on the duration of crisis reported in Study C97-1248, particularly because a substantial number of subjects did not achieve crisis resolution within 168 hours. However, a &#8220;responder&#8217;s analysis,&#8221; which analyzes the proportion of subjects who had achieved crisis resolution at 168 hours (without attribution), would not be affected by this truncation and may provide a more accurate picture of vepoloxamer&#8217;s treatment effect in this setting. In a post-hoc responder&#8217;s analysis of the intent-to-treat population (n=249), over 50% of subjects receiving study drug achieved crisis resolution within 168 hours, compared to 37% in the control group (p=0.02). In the under-16 age group, 60% of the treatment group achieved crisis resolution within 168 hours, compared to under 28% of the control group (p=0.009), and in the HU group, 46% of the treatment group achieved crisis resolution within 168 hours compared to 22% of the control group (p=0.016). 

Study C97-1248 was the first large, interventional clinical trial in sickle cell disease. We believe features of the study&#8217;s design and the study enrolling only 255 patients, which was fewer than the originally-planned 350 patients, may have further diluted the treatment effect observed in the study, and its significance. In addition to eliminating arbitrary observation periods (e.g., 168 hours), which will allow us to minimize the truncation effect described above, other lessons that we learned from Study C97-1248 include: simplifying the primary endpoint to minimize protocol violations and &#8220;left censored&#8221; data; avoiding subjective endpoints, which increase variability; standardizing pain management practices across study sites; improving data collection techniques; increasing homogeneity in terms of cumulative disease burden; and controlling the duration of crisis prior to randomization. 

In terms of safety, no clinically significant differences in the overall incidence of adverse events or adverse events defined as serious were observed between the treatment and control groups. Notably, the effects on serum creatinine reported as adverse events among subjects in the active treatment arm were comparable to those among subjects in the control arm. The active treatment arm was associated with transient elevations of liver enzymes (total and direct bilirubin, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and ALT (alanine 

&#160;

&#160;

aminotransferase)), each of which returned to its respective baseline level by the day-35 follow-up visit, except in patients whose liver enzymes had been elevated at baseline. Ad verse events with a greater than 5% increased incidence in the treatment group compared to the control group and their incidences for treatment and control groups, respectively, were as follows: bilirubinemia direct (54% vs. 37%), bilirubinemia (21% vs. 13 %), ALT increased (12% vs. 2%), thrombocytopenia (25% vs. 16%), nausea (41% vs. 34%), vomiting (36% vs. 28%), weight loss (28% vs. 15%), and urticaria (6% vs. 0%). Serious adverse events were reported for 23% and 22% of the patients in the treatment and co ntrol groups, respectively. Six patients in the treatment group discontinued treatment due to adverse events that included fever, bilirubinemia, tachycardia, pruritus, anemia, embolus, thrombocytopenia, acute chest syndrome, hypoxia, and dyspepsia. One pat ient in the treatment group died due to cardiopulmonary arrest, which was considered secondary to a fat embolism based on autopsy. The study investigator believed the underlying cause of death was due to sickle cell disease and not to treatment with vepolo xamer. 

Phase 3 Sub-Study . The effect of vepoloxamer on microvascular blood flow was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled sub-study conducted as part of Study C97-1248 (described above). Nine patients with sickle cell disease who were hospitalized for vaso-occlusive crisis were studied to objectively, longitudinally and quantitatively investigate the in vivo effects of vepoloxamer on real-time microcirculation in the bulbar conjunctiva during vaso-occlusive crisis. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive vepoloxamer or placebo (control). Following treatment, compared to control, all four patients treated with vepoloxamer showed significant improvement in red blood cell velocity at both approximately two hours (p=0.001) and at seven hours (p=0.000032) after initiation of treatment. In the case of the patients who received vepoloxamer, the velocity values observed at seven hours after initiation of treatment were similar to historical steady-state (non-crisis) values for sickle cell patients. 

Phase 1 Study in Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (Study C96-1237) . A Phase 1, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of vepoloxamer in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis. The study enrolled 17 adults (ages 19 and older) and 15 received study drug but two discontinued prior to completing the full dose due to breakthrough crisis pain and a problem with the IV line administration, respectively. The most common adverse events (incidence &#62;20%) were vomiting, nausea, headache, bilirubinemia, fever, anemia, and abdominal pain. Serious adverse events were reported in six patients. The serious adverse events experienced by five of the six patients were considered unrelated to vepoloxamer. The serious adverse events experienced by the sixth patient were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that were considered possibly related to vepoloxamer. No clinically significant changes in renal function were observed. 

Repeat Exposure Study in Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (Study C97-1273) . An open-label, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety of repeat exposure of vepoloxamer in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis. The study enrolled 28 patients, 16 of whom were children (ages 18 and younger). Vepoloxamer was administered as a treatment for up to six episodes of vaso-occlusive crisis occurring within a period of one year from enrollment. Seventeen patients received two or more exposures and one patient received six exposures. The most common adverse events (incidence &#62;20%) were fever, pruritis, bilirubinemia direct, constipation, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, abdominal pain, headache, thrombocytopenia, ALT increase, urine abnormality, jaundice, and dyspnea. Serious adverse events were reported in five patients. Only one patient experienced serious adverse events considered to be related to treatment with study drug (increased AST and ALT). One study patient died sixteen days after the completion of treatment. The cause of this patient&#8217;s death is not known, but the study investigator attributed it to sickle cell disease and considered it to be unrelated to study treatment. Two other subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events. No clinically significant changes in renal function were observed. 

Acute Chest Syndrome (Study C97-1243) . A dose-escalating, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of vepoloxamer in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute chest syndrome. The study enrolled 43 patients who were under 65 years of age and 42 received study drug. The median age of the patients was 19 years (range of one to 38 years). Patients were randomized to one of five dose groups and vepoloxamer was administered as a continuous, two-stage, intravenous infusion over 24 hours. All patients received a loading dose of 200 mg/kg given over one hour, followed by one of the following maintenance doses given over 23 hours: 40 mg/kg/hr, 60 mg/kg/hr, 80 mg/kg/hr, 100 mg/kg/hr or 120 mg/kg/hr. Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) was measured as an efficacy biomarker. sPLA2 has been shown in clinical studies to correlate with the onset and resolution of acute chest syndrome. Among the 34 patients who had elevated sPLA2 levels at baseline, levels returned to steady-state levels by the end of the 24-hour infusion period and remained at steady-state through follow-up. All doses appeared equally effective. 

&#160;

&#160;

Notably, the mean duration of hospitalization for patients in Study C97-1243 was shor ter compared to historical controls. Specifically, in a 538-subject, 30-center study of patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute chest syndrome published in the New England Journal of Medicine (2000) mean duration of hospitalization was 12.8 da ys for patients older than 19 years (n=128) and 9.9 days for patients 19 years and younger (n=409). In Study C97-1243, the mean duration of hospitalization of patients older than 19 years (n=14) was 7.2 days for patients in the low dose groups (maintenance doses of 40, 60 or 80 mg/kg/hr, n=10) and 6.3 days for patients in the high dose groups (maintenance doses of 100 or 120 mg/kg/hr, n=4) and the mean duration of hospitalization of patients 19 years and younger (n=27) was 7.9 days for patients in the low d ose groups (n=20) and 4.1 days for patients in the high dose groups (n=7). 

In terms of safety, vepoloxamer was generally well-tolerated at all dose levels. The most common adverse events (incidence of &#62;20%) were fever, pain, tachycardia, constipation, vomiting, bilirubinemia, bilirubinemia-direct, weight loss and rhinitis. Serious adverse events were reported in eight patients (19%), and two patients had serious adverse events considered related to study treatment (abnormal gait, bilirubinemia and bilirubinemia-direct), but no patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. One patient died during the study due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. That patient had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and died on day 8 post-treatment. The study investigator considered the patient&#8217;s death unlikely to be attributable to the study drug. Importantly, results from the renal function test did not reveal any pattern or dose-related effects suggestive of renal dysfunction across the range of doses studied. 

Phase 2 Study of Poloxamer 188 (Non-Purified) in Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (Study 130-005) . Prior to development of vepoloxamer, poloxamer 188 (non&#8209;purified) was evaluated in a Phase 1 study in patients with sickle cell disease (n=7) (Study 02) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (Study 130 - 005). Study 130 - 005 enrolled 50 patients ages 15 and older, with 28 randomized to receive poloxamer 188 and 22 to receive placebo. Study medication was administered as a continuous, two-stage, intravenous infusion over 48 hours. In the efficacy analyses, three subgroups of patients were considered: subgroup 1 (n=49) was the intent-to-treat population, subgroup 2 (n=45) excluded patients with a study drug infusion duration of less than 24 hours, and subgroup 3 (n=31) excluded patients who did not receive the full dose of study drug or for whom the end-of-painful episode time was estimated. Safety data were analyzed in all 50 patients. The primary endpoint in Study 130 - 005 was duration of crisis and secondary endpoints were pain intensity, total analgesic use, and days of hospitalization. Median duration of crisis was reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group by 13 hours in subgroup 1 (67 vs 80 hours, p=0.147), by 28 hours in subgroup 2 (60 vs 88 hours, p=0.097), and by 36 hours in subgroup 3 (44 vs 80 hours, p=0.020). Duration of hospitalization was reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group by one day in subgroup 1 (5 vs 6 days, p=0.298), by two days in subgroup 2 (5 vs 7 days, p=0.261), and by two days in subgroup 3 (5 vs 7 days, p=0.145). Total analgesic use (measured by morphine equivalent units, or MEU) was reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group by 102 mg in subgroup 1 (median MEU of 57 mg vs 159 mg, p=0.055), by 120 mg in subgroup 2 (median MEU of 49 mg vs 169 mg, p=0.037), and by 111 mg in subgroup 3 (median MEU of 34 mg vs 145 mg, p=0.014). Parenteral analgesic use was reduced in the treatment group compared to the control group by 102 mg in subgroup 1 (median MEU of 47 mg vs 149 mg, p=0.075), by 110 mg in subgroup 2 (median MEU of 40 mg vs 150 mg, p=0.048), and by 106 mg in subgroup 3 (median MEU of 27 mg vs 133 mg, p=0.014). 

In terms of safety, poloxamer 188 was generally well-tolerated. Adverse events were similar in both groups and most were either mild or moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events (incidence &#62;5%) were headache, nausea, injection site pain, abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. One adverse event was considered serious and attributable to study medication &#8211; a subject in the poloxamer 188 with mild underlying renal dysfunction (baseline creatinine 1.5 mg/dL) had a transient increase in serum creatinine concentration during infusion (peak concentration = 2.7 mg/dL). No treatment was required and his creatinine returned to baseline by the time of the follow-up assessment. 

Vepoloxamer &#8211; Phase 2 Product Candidate for the Treatment of Heart Failure

Overview of Heart Failure and the Significant Unmet Need for New Therapies

Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which heart muscle is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the body&#8217;s needs. A healthy heart pumps blood continuously through the circulatory system to deliver oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body&#8217;s cells and enable normal functioning. Heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction is categorized according to left ventricular ejection fraction into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF (also known as systolic heart failure), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF (also known as diastolic heart failure). In HFrEF, the left ventricle of the heart loses its ability to contract with enough force for the circulation to meet the metabolic needs of the body. In HFpEF, the left ventricle loses its ability to relax normally because the muscle has become stiff and the heart can&#8217;t properly fill with blood during the resting period between each beat. 

&#160;

&#160;

It is estimated that more than 20 million individuals worldwide suffer from heart failure, with approximately 5.7 million in the U.S. alone. Heart failure is the most c ommon diagnosis for hospital admission in the U.S. among patients over age 65. The American Heart Association estimates that total medical costs of heart failure in the U.S. will increase from approximately $21 billion in 2012 to approximately $31 billion in 2020 and $53 billion in 2030, with the vast majority of such costs related to hospitalization. 

Most existing therapies target indirect methods that reduce the workload on the heart, but may not directly improve heart function. For example, ACE inhibitors widen blood vessels (vasodilate) to lower blood pressure and reduce the resistance against which the heart must pump. However, they do not directly improve the heart&#8217;s ability to contract normally. These indirect approaches provide symptomatic relief and have improved mortality, but there remains an urgent need for new therapies, as evidenced by the more than one million hospitalizations each year in the U.S. with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. Further, Medicare patients hospitalized for heart failure have median 30-day readmission and mortality rates of approximately 22% and 12%, respectively. 

Vepoloxamer may offer a new mechanistic approach for treating heart failure that improves heart function directly through its membrane-sealing activity and indirectly through its hemorheologic activity. In a failing heart, it is thought that dysfunctional cardiac cell membranes result in unregulated entry of calcium into cells leading to calcium overload toxicity. Vepoloxamer&#8217;s membrane-sealing activity may help restore dysfunctional cardiac cell membranes, thus minimizing calcium overload injury and directly improving heart contractility. Vepoloxamer&#8217;s hemorheologic activity may minimize the heart&#8217;s workload by reducing blood viscosity and improving microvascular blood flow and oxygen delivery within the heart. If vepoloxamer can alter the trajectory of heart failure, whether by preserving heart tissue or decreasing cardiac workload, it has the potential to minimize cardiac myocyte damage and improve clinical outcomes, such as hospital readmission and survival. 

Nonclinical Proof-of-Concept and Repeat Treatment Studies

Proof-of-Concept Study 

To investigate the utility of vepoloxamer as a treatment for heart failure, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, nonclinical study of vepoloxamer in an experimental model of chronic, stable heart failure. A single dose of vepoloxamer (low dose (225 mg/kg) or high dose (450 mg/kg)) or placebo was administered intravenously over two hours. Hemodynamic, ventriculographic, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic measurements were taken at baseline (prior to study drug administration) and at the following time-points after the start of study drug administration: two hours (end of administration), 24 hours, one week and two weeks. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained at the same time-points. The study was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Hani N. Sabbah at Henry Ford Health System. The improvements described below were calculated as the difference between baseline and mean values of each study group at each time-point using a one-way analysis of variance, with p&#60;0.05 considered significant. 

The study demonstrated that a single, two-hour infusion of vepoloxamer improved left ventricular (LV) systolic function that was significant immediately (at the end of vepoloxamer administration) and remained significant at one week (and, in some cases, at two weeks) after vepoloxamer administration. In particular, vepoloxamer demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in LV ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and cardiac output. 

In addition, the single, two-hour infusion of vepoloxamer resulted in prolonged (one to two week) improvement in biomarkers of LV remodeling, cell death, inflammation and collagen deposition, while saline infusion in the control group had no effect on any of the biomarkers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vepoloxamer resulted in statistically significant and progressive reductions in troponin-I, at both one week and two weeks after vepoloxamer administration. Specifically, at two weeks post-administration, compared to baseline values, mean reduction (improvement) in troponin was 46.7% for the low-dose group and 48.8% for the high-dose group. In contrast, in the control group, troponin increased 7.7%. Troponin is an intracellular protein that is released from cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) following injury to and/or death of these cells. In patients with heart failure, elevated troponin levels have been associated with more severe disease and a worse clinical prognosis. A recent clinical study confirmed that increasing troponin during hospital stay is associated with increased 180-day all-cause mortality and hypothesized that preventing myocardial damage, as evidenced by reduced levels of troponin, might favorably influence survival. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Vepoloxamer also resulted in statistically significant and progressive reductions in plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), at both one week and two weeks after vepoloxamer admi nistration. Specifically, at two weeks post-administration, compared to baseline values, mean reduction (improvement) in NT-proBNP was 54.5% for the low-dose group and 61.4% for the high-dose group. In contrast, in the control group, NT-proBNP increased 3. 5%. NT-proBNP is released from the heart during periods of increased cardiac wall stress, typically as a result of the increased fluid volumes that are common in heart failure. Studies have associated persistently elevated natriuretic peptide concentration s during hospital stay with poor prognosis. A recent clinical study found that higher NT-proBNP levels are associated with increased 180-day all-cause mortality. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Additionally, vepoloxamer significantly reduced plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interlukin-6 (IL-6), C&#8209;reactive protein (CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), at both one week and two weeks after vepoloxamer administration. 

Repeat Treatment Study 

Following the single administration, proof-of-concept study, the effects of repeat-administration of vepoloxamer on LV systolic and diastolic function were evaluated in a second randomized, placebo-controlled, study in the same model of chronic, stable heart failure as discussed above. In this study, vepoloxamer (450 mg/kg) or placebo was administered over two hours at the start of the study and a repeat treatment was administered three weeks after the first administration, with the study concluding six weeks after the first administration. The study was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Hani N. Sabbah at Henry Ford Health System. Consistent with results of the proof-of-concept study, the first treatment of vepoloxamer in this study resulted in robust improvements that persisted for one to two weeks in key parameters of heart function, including LV end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output. LV ejection fraction was improved by approximately 20% for up to two weeks, returning to baseline values by three weeks post-administration. Diastolic function also was improved. The second treatment resulted in similar improvements in LV systolic and diastolic function. However, the effects observed after the second treatment persisted for at least three weeks post-administration to the end of the study. Following the second treatment of vepoloxamer, LV ejection fraction had not returned to baseline values by the end of the six-week study, but was still improved by approximately 20% above baseline values. Vepoloxamer had no statistically significant effect on heart rate, blood pressure or end-diastolic volume after either administration. The study also demonstrated that troponin-I and NT-proBNP were improved following both the first and second administrations of vepoloxamer. The effect on these biomarkers was of similar magnitude and duration as observed in the single administration study discussed above. 

Clinical Development

Encouraged by the results of the nonclinical studies discussed above, as well as recommendations from medical experts in heart failure, we commenced clinical development of vepoloxamer in heart failure in October 2015. Our ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer will enroll approximately 150 ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure (LV ejection fraction &#8804; 35%). Patients in this study are randomized into one of three approximately 50-patient study arms and receive one of two dose levels of a new formulation of vepoloxamer or placebo control intravenously over three hours in an outpatient setting or short-stay inpatient unit, depending on local practice and resource availability. We designed the new formulation of vepoloxamer being evaluated in this study to be more suitable for heart failure patients. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, three-hour infusion of vepoloxamer compared to placebo, including vepoloxamer&#8217;s effect on markers of cardiac injury (troponin) and wall stress (NT-proBNP), as well as clinical outcomes such as changes in echocardiographic measurements, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. 

Vepoloxamer &#8211; Other Clinical Development Opportunities

Ischemic Stroke

We also are evaluating vepoloxamer&#8217;s potential in acute ischemic cerebrovascular infarction, known as &#8220;stroke.&#8221; Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. and a leading cause of long-term disability. Over 85% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, meaning they occur when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is occluded, or blocked, by a clot. Timely restoration of blood flow is critical for stroke patients as brain damage is a rapid, progressive process. In a typical large-vessel acute ischemic stroke, 1.9 million neurons may be lost each minute. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, is approved for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, in stroke patients, due to bleeding risks, tPA should not be administered until intracranial hemorrhage has been excluded by a cranial computerized tomography, or CT, scan, which can delay treatment. At the same time, tPA has not demonstrated improved outcomes for stroke patients if administered more than three hours after onset of stroke symptoms. 

&#160;

&#160;

There is a significant need for a pharmacologic agent that enhances the breakdown of blood clots, or th rombolysis. The mechanistic activities of vepoloxamer facilitate thrombolysis and suggest potential to shorten the time to clot lysis or attain similar thrombolysis at a reduced dosage of thrombolytic, such as tPA. In addition, vepoloxamer&#8217;s cytoprotective properties may reduce reperfusion injury, with the potential to limit tissue necrosis. Further, improving microvascular flow and distal tissue reperfusion should also reduce untoward events from the no-reflow phenomenon, relieving persistent tissue ischem ia despite restoration of large vessel patency. Additionally, because the risk of hemorrhagic complications from thrombolytics is associated with the dose and duration of infusion, more rapid thrombolysis and/or lower dosage of thrombolytic agent has the p otential to decrease the risk of bleeding. 

In 2015, we announced positive data from a nonclinical study of vepoloxamer in ischemic stroke. In an experimental model of delayed administration of tPA treatment following embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), vepoloxamer, both alone and in combination with tPA, reduced neurological function deficits, lesion volume and intravascular fibrin deposition without increased incidence of gross hemorrhage compared to treatment with tPA alone and saline controls. In the study, tPA was administered four hours after MCAO. Treatment with vepoloxamer in combination with tPA significantly (p&#60;0.05) improved neurologic function (measured with adhesive removal test and modified neurological severity scores at one and seven days after MCAO) and reduced ischemic brain lesion volume and microvascular fibrin deposition compared to treatment with tPA alone or saline. Importantly, vepoloxamer was not associated with any increase in hemorrhagic risk. No significant differences of the incidence of gross hemorrhage were detected among groups.

Based on our nonclinical data, as well as published data from third party studies of poloxamer 188, we believe, and several medical experts in the field have agreed, that sufficient data now exists to support clinical development of vepoloxamer in stroke. Consequently, during the third quarter of 2015, we elected to discontinue our Phase 2 clinical study of vepoloxamer in combination with tPA for the treatment of acute limb ischemia and directly pursue the opportunity for clinical development of vepoloxamer in stroke. However, we do not anticipate commencing clinical development in stroke without further evaluation of the opportunity and not prior to our analysis of results from our Phase 3 EPIC study of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease. 

Resuscitation Following Major Trauma

We believe that vepoloxamer also has potential as a resuscitation fluid to improve outcomes for patients who experience shock following major trauma. However, currently, we do not plan to initiate a clinical study in this indication without funding from the U.S. government or some other third-party collaborator. In 2014, we signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with a branch of the U.S. military to evaluate the utility of vepoloxamer in nonclinical models of trauma of interest to the U.S. government. If the results of such studies are positive, the U.S. government may have interest in developing vepoloxamer as a therapy in major trauma. 

AIR001 &#8211; Phase 2 Product Candidate for the Treatment of HFpEF

AIR001 is a sodium nitrite solution for intermittent inhalation via nebulization. Nitrite is a direct vasodilator and can be recycled in vivo to form nitric oxide (NO) independent of the classical NO synthase (NOS) pathway. Nitrite mediated NO formation has several beneficial effects, including dilation of blood vessels and reduction of inflammation and undesirable cell growth. Generation of NO from sodium nitrite is not dependent upon endothelial function and is enhanced in the setting of tissue hypoxia and acidosis, conditions in which NOS activity typically is depressed. In experimental models, nitrite use has demonstrated improved remodeling both in the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle. Hemodynamic effects include venodilation with reductions in right atrial pressures, pulmonary and systemic vasodilation with reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and left atrial pressures, and improved cardiac relaxation. In addition, nonclinical studies have demonstrated that nitrite can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial fusion and decrease mitochondrial oxygen consumption through a mechanism distinct from that of NO, which may have utility in treating heart failure. 

We obtained the AIR001 program through our acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2014. Prior to the acquisition, AIR001 had been tested in more than 120 healthy volunteers and patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension in three Phase 1 studies and one Phase 2 study and was generally well-tolerated. While the Phase 2 study in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, known as Study CS05, was prematurely terminated due to Aires&#8217; capital constraints prior to the acquisition, data from the 29 patients who enrolled in the study were positive, showing a trend towards improvements in hemodynamic parameters and change in exercise capacity from baseline, and AIR001 was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events. In particular, methemoglobin levels remained normal (&#60; 1.5%), which distinguishes AIR001 from safety concerns associated with intravenously-administered nitrite. 

&#160;

&#160;

Significant Unmet Need in HFpEF and Development Rationale 

We are developing AIR001 for the treatment of patients with HFpEF. Data show that approximately 50% of patients hospitalized for heart failure have HFpEF and the prevalence of HFpEF is expected to increase as the population ages. To date, no pharmacologic agents have shown convincing evidence of efficacy in HFpEF and few interventions have been observed to improve symptoms or quality of life for HFpEF patients. 

People with HFpEF suffer from dyspnea and fatigue with activity, limiting exercise tolerance. The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and includes left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and peripheral abnormalities. In HFpEF patients, cardiac pressures are often normal at rest but elevated with stress (exercise), creating a major barrier to treatment because interventions that reduce filling pressures during exercise also reduce resting pressures, increasing vulnerability to hypotension. While HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome, which may explain the failure of clinical studies testing therapies that have shown efficacy in treating HFrEF, elevation in left ventricular (LV) filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures during exercise has been a universal finding in HFpEF patients. 

Evidence points to impaired nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) bioavailability as playing a central role in the abnormalities that limit exercise capacity in HFpEF patients. NO-cGMP levels can be increased using direct NO donors, such as the organic nitrates. However, organic nitrates have shown several shortcomings, including the development of tolerance, greater vulnerability to hypotension in patients with HFpEF, development of &#8220;pseudo-tolerance,&#8221; where chronic venodilation leads to renal sodium retention, and increases in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Inorganic nitrite is an alternative strategy to restoring NO-cGMP levels. Notably, because generation of NO from nitrite is enhanced with tissue hypoxia and acidosis, as occur during exercise, it becomes most active at the time of greatest need for HFpEF patients. 

Clinical Development in HFpEF

We have supported two investigator-sponsored Phase 2a studies of AIR001 in patients with HFpEF, one of which is ongoing. In February 2016, we reported positive top-line results from the first Phase 2a study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AIR001 in 30 patients with HFpEF. In the study, AIR001 showed statistically significant improvement for the pre-specified primary endpoint: change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at 20 Watts exercise after drug treatment relative to PCWP at 20 Watts exercise in the initial assessment prior to drug treatment, compared to placebo-treated patients. Study data show that nebulized AIR001 attenuates the hemodynamic derangements of cardiac failure that occur during exercise in HFpEF patients. AIR001 was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events. 

In February 2016, we also announced that AIR001 had been selected by the Heart Failure Clinical Research Network for evaluation in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 2 study of AIR001 in approximately 100 patients with HFpEF, known as the INDIE-HFpEF study. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether AIR001, as compared to placebo, improves maximal exercise capacity as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The study is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2016. We believe this study can provide evidence and rationale for pursuing a Phase 3 clinical study in HFpEF.

Commercialization Strategy

We intend to independently commercialize vepoloxamer for sickle cell crisis, if approved, in the United States and the European Union. Treatment centers for patients with sickle cell disease are concentrated in a relatively small number of metropolitan areas in the U.S. and EU and, as a result, we believe a sales force of approximately 30 representatives in the U.S. and approximately 10 representatives in the EU can effectively market our product in those territories, if approved. Given the current stage of our product candidates&#8217; development and anticipated regulatory approval timelines, we have not yet established a commercial infrastructure, including a sales force. In building our sales force, we intend to recruit representatives with experience in the acute care and/or hospital setting, particularly with hematology products. For other key global markets, such as in the Middle East and North Africa, we will seek to partner with one or more organizations that have expertise selling in those regions. 

Our commercial strategy for vepoloxamer, if approved, will include promoting its clinical benefits and a concerted effort to raise awareness in the sickle cell patient community about the existence of a treatment option for shortening the duration of a vaso-occlusive crisis, of which there currently are none. Recent data from the Health Care Utilization Project (HCUP) indicate that approximately 95% of patients with sickle cell disease have medical insurance and more than 75% are in public plans (Medicaid or Medicare). Based upon the treatment setting, which is hospital inpatient, and the payer mix, which is majority public plans, we expect the patient&#8217;s share of costs for an episode of care to be minimal and not adversely impact potential utilization. We believe the combination of our commercial effort, the high unmet need, and vepoloxamer&#8217;s product profile will facilitate rapid and extensive penetration in the sickle cell market. 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

We do not have, and have not made plans to establish, our own manufacturing facilities. We meet our requirements for nonclinical and clinical trial material (including manufacturing API, formulating and assembling final drug product, labeling, testing and release, packaging, storing API and finished drug product and similar activities) by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. 

In the case of clinical trial material for our vepoloxamer programs, currently, we have a single-source supplier of the drug substance, vepoloxamer, and single-source suppliers of the finished drug products for our sickle cell disease program and heart failure program, respectively. We have an agreement with Pierre Fabre M&#233;dicament (PFM) for supply of vepoloxamer for clinical development. As we position toward commercialization in sickle cell disease, we expect to enter into commercial supply agreements with PFM and the third-party supplier of finished drug product for sickle cell disease, Patheon Inc. There are a limited number of manufacturers with the technical capabilities and desire to perform the specialized, proprietary processes required to produce vepoloxamer, however, to support commercialization of vepoloxamer in sickle cell disease we are pursuing alternative supply sources. 

In addition, although it is commercially available, there are a limited number of sources of poloxamer 188, the starting material for vepoloxamer. BASF, the current supplier of our starting material, has extensive, worldwide operations and poloxamer 188 is part of its standard product portfolio; however, we do not have any control over BASF&#8217;s production of poloxamer 188 and BASF may change its manufacturing process and/or limit the availability of its poloxamer 188 product in the future. 

In the case of AIR001 clinical trial material, we also have single-source, third-party suppliers of API and finished drug product and there are a limited number of manufacturers with the technical capabilities and desire to produce AIR001. In addition, AIR001 is administered via nebulization and the proprietary nebulizer device currently validated for use in clinical studies of AIR001 is manufactured and supplied by a single third-party. 

We are investigating manufacturing-related opportunities to enhance our proprietary position around vepoloxamer, including those involving proprietary API starting material, alternative purification processes, unique analytical methods and new drug product formulations, and AIR001, including those involving alternative drug product formulations and delivery systems.

In the future, establishing supply agreements, particularly with respect to commercial manufacturing and supply, may require us to agree to substantial investment in infrastructure, minimum volume requirements, exclusivity arrangements, and/or other restrictive or potentially costly terms. As discussed above, our alternatives may be limited due to the specialized nature of the technologies and methods used to manufacture our product candidates and, in the case of ARI001, the specialized and proprietary device needed for administration of our product candidate. In addition, if we seek to make certain changes to the manufacturing process, including changing our sources of API starting material, API, or finished drug product, or to the drug delivery device, we may need FDA review and approval before a change can be implemented. Among other things, the FDA may require clinical, stability or other data for any product candidate manufactured with new materials or by new manufacturers, which data will take time and is costly to generate, and the delay associated with generating this data would increase our costs and may delay completion of development of a product candidate and/or its commercial launch or, once launched, our ability to meet market demand for the product. 

Intellectual Property

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing equivalent versions of our product candidates. To protect our proprietary compounds, we have implemented and will continue to pursue a multi-faceted approach that relies on a combination of patent protection, proprietary know-how, trade secrets, and data and market exclusivity. We seek to establish and protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, including those with our contract manufacturers, such as PFM. 

We have filed patent applications claiming vepoloxamer as a novel composition of poloxamer material. We also have filed for patent protection covering a process of manufacture of vepoloxamer, various methods of therapeutic use of poloxamers, including vepoloxamer, and our new formulation of vepoloxamer for the treatment of heart failure patients. We anticipate making additional patent filings, including around vepoloxamer&#8217;s therapeutic uses, administration and formulation. In addition, we plan to file patent applications claiming priority to the initial applications in various countries, as determined in consultation with our patent professionals with the goal of obtaining relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us or potential partners. As of March 10, 2016, we owned one granted patent covering our vepoloxamer product candidate, which was issued by a country other than the U.S. and relates to methods of use of purified poloxamers to treat storage-lesioned compromised blood and compositions of purified poloxamers and storage-lesioned blood. 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the patent protection we are seeking, we continue to expand our manufacturing know-how, which we maintain as a trade secret. For macromolecules, such as vepoloxamer, testing methods and acceptance criteria for starting material s and in-process and release specifications are critical to the quality of drug product. Without these proprietary specifications, we believe competitors will be unable to adequately characterize products that are equivalent to our vepoloxamer products in the manner that regulatory agencies will require. Further, we are evaluating the development of a proprietary process for manufacturing API starting material, which we expect would further protect the markets for our vepoloxamer products, if approved. 

For particular indications, such as rare or orphan diseases, our products may benefit from periods of post-approval &#8220;marketing exclusivity.&#8221; Vepoloxamer has orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union for the treatment of sickle cell disease. As described below under &#8220;Government Regulation &#8211; Orphan Drug Designation,&#8221; due to our orphan designation, if our vepoloxamer product receives FDA approval for the treatment of sickle cell disease, the FDA will not approve any other application to market a drug product with the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug product showing clinical superiority to ours. With regard to the European Union, our vepoloxamer product may benefit from ten years of market exclusivity for the treatment of sickle cell disease with the potential for an additional two years of market exclusivity if a paediatric investigation plan, or PIP, is completed. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the same indication for which our orphan drug product is approved. 

In the case of AIR001, we have filed for patent protection covering various methods of therapeutic use of inorganic nitrite, and under the NIH License (discussed below), we have certain exclusive rights to issued and pending patents related to various methods of therapeutic use of inorganic nitrite salts. We may also seek to obtain other licenses to third party patents and other rights to the extent we determine they relate to potential therapeutic uses of AIR001. Additionally, we believe there is potential to establish exclusivity around the combination of AIR001 and its inhalation delivery system. 

We are aware of a substantial number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields, and we may want or determine that we need to obtain licenses to patents or other rights owned by third parties. There is a risk that third parties may allege that they have patent rights encompassing our products or methods and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued, that contain claims covering our product candidates or methods. 

We cannot provide assurance that our pending patent applications will issue as patents, that any issued patents will provide us with significant competitive advantages, or that the validity or enforceability of any of our patents will not be challenged or, if instituted, that these challenges will not be successful. The cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of our patents could be substantial. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or methods, duplicate our technologies or methods, or design around the patented aspects of our products, technologies or methods. We can provide no assurance that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others, licenses to which might not be available to us. 

In addition, the approval process for patent applications in different countries may differ significantly. The patent authorities in each country administer that country&#8217;s laws and regulations relating to patents independently of the laws and regulations of any other country and the patents must be sought and obtained separately, which can add substantial cost and expense. Further, a favorable outcome or approval in one country does not necessarily indicate that a favorable outcome or approval will be obtained in other countries. 

In-Licensing Agreements 

License Agreement with CytRx Corporation

As discussed in more detail below, in April 2011, we acquired SynthRx, Inc. Under a 2004 agreement, CytRx granted SynthRx an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, certain intellectual property, including as related to surface-active copolymers, exemplified by poloxamer 188, to use, offer and sell covered products in all of the countries in the world and in all fields, except those fields that, at the time of the agreement, were or would be licensed pursuant to certain identified agreements. We believe that the field limitation does not prevent us from developing or commercializing vepoloxamer in the fields in which we are pursuing its development. 

In partial consideration of the license grant, SynthRx agreed to pay CytRx certain non-refundable and non-creditable milestone payments based on the approval of each covered product in a major market, which includes the United States. The amount of each milestone payment is $2 million, half of which is due on the first commercial sale of the approved product and half of which is payable over time at a rate of 25% of quarterly net sales. In addition, SynthRx would pay a 5% royalty on quarterly net sales of covered products on a country-by-country, subject to up to 50% reduction in certain circumstances, for the longer of seven years from the date of first commercial sale of the covered product in a country or the expiration of the last applicable patent for a covered 

&#160;

&#160;

product. However, in the event of a sublicense under the specified patents, in lieu of the foregoing milestone and royalty paym ents, SynthRx, in its sole discretion, may elect to pay CytRx an amount equal to 20% of any sublicensing income received by SynthRx within 30 days of receipt thereof. Sublicense income includes, without limitation, license fees, royalties, milestone paymen ts, license maintenance fees and strategic alliance payments, whether in cash, equity or other property, with the payment by SynthRx to CytRx to be in the same form as the payment received by SynthRx. In December 2014, we merged SynthRx, then our wholly-ow ned subsidiary, with and into Mast Therapeutics and assumed the rights and obligations under the license agreement with CytRx. 

License Agreement with The National Institutes of Health

We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide rights to issued and pending patents related to nitrite salts and their uses, under which it may develop and commercialize inhaled nitrite formulations to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, ischemia reperfusion injury and reperfusion injury associated with organ transplantation pursuant to a Public Health Service Patent License Agreement &#8211; Exclusive, which we refer to as the NIH License. Under the terms of the NIH License, Aires agreed to make a minimum annual payment of $15,000. Aires may also be obligated to make &#8220;benchmark&#8221; payments of up to $7.0 million, with (a) $0.2 million upon dosing of first patient in a Phase 3 clinical study in pulmonary arterial hypertension, (b) $0.1 million related to the issuance of the first U.S. patent in the licensed field of use, and (c) an aggregate of $6.8 million related to the filing of the first NDA, regulatory approval, and commercial sales of a covered product in pulmonary arterial hypertension. In addition to these benchmark payments, to the extent a covered product is approved for commercial sale, under the NIH License, Aires will pay annual royalties ranging from 4% to 5% of its annual net sales of covered products. Because the NIH License currently is limited by fields of use, we are exploring expansion of its scope, including a field of use expansion that would include heart failure. 

Competition

The industries in which we operate (biopharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical) are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. If any of our product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, we expect they will face significant competition. We may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, compliance and financial resources and experience than do we. 

Over the longer term, our ability, independently or otherwise, to successfully manufacture, market, distribute and sell any approved products, expand their usage or bring additional new products to the marketplace will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, FDA and foreign regulatory agency approval of new products and of new indications for existing products, the efficacy and safety of our products (alone and relative to other treatment options), the degree of patent or other protection afforded to particular products, and reimbursement for use of those products. 

Many other organizations are developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat the same diseases and conditions for which our product candidates are in development, and the success of others may render potential application of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, even prior to completion of its development. 

Further, there is increasing interest in developing drugs for rare diseases, which may have the effect of increasing the development of agents to treat sickle cell disease and other rare diseases we may pursue. Legislative action may generate further interest. 

Sickle Cell Disease 

Currently, there are few options for patients suffering complications of sickle cell disease. Patients experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis typically are treated with hydration, oxygen, and analgesia for pain, usually consisting of narcotics, such as morphine. Hydroxyurea, a form of chemotherapy used for myeloproliferative disease and approved for sickle cell disease in 1998, is an approved product that has been shown to decrease the frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis. It is not approved to intervene during an ongoing a vaso-occlusive crisis to reduce its duration or severity; it has not been shown to treat the crisis itself. To date, no therapeutic agents have been approved to reduce the duration or severity of an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis. 

There is, however, substantial interest in developing agents to treat various aspects of sickle cell disease. We are aware of numerous companies with product candidates in varying stages of development for the prevention and treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis, including mechanisms that target the P2Y12 ADP receptor, increase oxygen binding of hemoglobin or stimulate production of fetal hemoglobin. Some of these companies are large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or have partnered with such companies, which may give them development, regulatory and/or marketing advantages over us. For example, Pfizer and Novartis have each invested in companies, GlycoMimetics, Inc. and Selexys Pharmaceuticals Corporation, respectively, with clinical-stage agents for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis. Pfizer is enrolling a Phase 3 clinical study of 

&#160;

&#160;

GlycoMimetics&#8217; rivipansel in adult and adolescent patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisi s and estimates completion of the study in July 2018. Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. completed a Phase 3 study of its L-glutamine treatment for sickle cell patients in 2013, but the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint for reduction in the number o f sickle cell crises during a 48-week period. However, based on statements in its most recent periodic report filed with the SEC in May 2015, Emmaus is preparing to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval of its L-glutamine product candidate for si ckle cell patients ages five and older. Global Blood Therapeutics Inc. is conducting what it characterizes as a Phase 1/2 clinical study of its product candidate GBT440, an oral, once-daily therapy intended to prevent the sickling of red blood cells in si ckle cell patients, and estimates completion of this early stage study in May 2016. Further, numerous non-profit or non-commercial foundations and interest groups are committed to improving outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease. Advances in the un derstanding of the signaling pathways associated with sickle cell disease may lead to further interest and development of treatment options. 

More broadly, vepoloxamer may compete against agents designed to treat the underlying pathology of sickle cell disease, of which vaso-occlusive crisis is the hallmark complication. On the other hand, it may be used in combination with any such therapies. Bone marrow and stem cell transplantation have been shown to be effective to treat and, in some cases, cure sickle cell disease, but current methods are not available to the majority of patients due to the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease and infection, the high cost of the procedures, and the unavailability of a well-matched donor. Forms of gene therapy are being pursued to correct sickle cell disease by halting production of sickled cells, but they are in preclinical or early-stage clinical development and for only patients with the more severe forms of sickle cell disease. For example, bluebird bio, Inc. is conducting a Phase 1 clinical study of its LentiGlobin&#174; BB305 product candidate for patients with severe sickle cell disease and estimates completion of this Phase 1 study in March 2019. 

Heart Failure 

Treatment options in heart failure vary depending on disease severity, patient-specific factors such as age and comorbidities, the underlying cause of failure, and whether the condition is compensated (stable) or decompensated (deteriorating). Lifestyle changes (e.g., heart healthy diet, stopping smoking, controlling weight, monitoring fluid in-take) can reduce risk factors for coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, all of which can contribute to heart failure. Lifestyle changes or medications, such as cholesterol-lowering statins, that address these risk factors may reduce the prevalence of heart failure. 

In addition, a variety of medications are commonly used to treat heart failure. These include diuretics, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists and inotropes (such as digoxin). Depending on symptoms, many patients take a combination of two or more of these drugs. Surgery and medical devices also can treat the underlying causes of heart failure. Coronary bypass surgery, heart valve repair/replacement, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, pacemakers, left ventricular assist devices, heart pumps and heart transplant all may improve symptoms, quality of life and survival in patients with heart failure. More potent diuretics and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, may be used to relieve symptoms by reducing congestion in the body&#8217;s tissues. 

Despite the wide range of treatment options, heart failure remains the leading cause of hospital admission in the U.S. for people over age 65 and morbidity and mortality from heart failure remain high. Numerous companies are working to address this unmet medical need and some products have either recently received approval or are in late-stage clinical studies. Most notably, Novartis&#8217; Entresto&#8482; (formerly, LCZ696), a dual-acting angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in July 2015 and by the European regulatory agency in November 2015 as a treatment for patients with HFrEF. Novartis is also evaluating RLX030 (serelaxin), a relaxin receptor agonist, in a second Phase 3 study in patients with acute heart failure with cardiovascular mortality as the primary endpoint. Although the product was approved for sale and launched in Russia in 2014 (under a different trade name), U.S. and EU regulatory agencies required further data for approval. Other development approaches include myofilament calcium sensitizers, stem cell therapy, gene therapy and drugs that enhance the uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 

We are not aware of any pharmacologic therapy of proven benefit for patients with HFpEF. Therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in HFrEF have thus far failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in patients with HFpEF. A Phase 3 study of Novartis&#8217; LCZ696 in patients with HFpEF is underway, with an estimated completion date of May 2019. We are aware of other therapies under investigation in earlier stage clinical studies for the treatment of HFpEF. 

If vepoloxamer is approved as a treatment for patients with HFrEF, it may compete with Novartis&#8217; Entresto and other treatment options currently available. In addition, should any therapy that receives approval prior to our product candidates become entrenched in the standard of care, the need for our product candidates may be diminished and/or such competing products may be difficult to displace.

&#160;

&#160;

Acquisition of SynthRx, Inc. 

We acquired our vepoloxamer program through the acquisition of SynthRx, Inc. in April 2011. Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, upon completion of the acquisition, SynthRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. In December 2014, we effected a roll-up of SynthRx with and into Mast Therapeutics through a short-form merger under Delaware law. 

The merger consideration related to the 2011 acquisition of SynthRx consisted solely of shares of our common stock. Additional payments of up to 12,478,050 shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of SynthRx may be triggered if and when the development of vepoloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children achieves certain milestones. For additional information regarding these potential milestone share issuances, see &#8220;Acquisition of SynthRx&#8221; under Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this report. 

Acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals 

We acquired our AIR001 program through the acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2014. Pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, upon completion of the acquisition, Aires became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The merger consideration related to the acquisition consisted solely of shares of our common stock. All of the shares issuable to former stockholders of Aires as merger consideration were issued during 2014. There are no milestone or earn-out payments under the merger agreement. For additional information regarding the merger consideration, see &#8220;Acquisition of Aires Pharmaceuticals&#8221; under Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this report.

Government Regulation 

Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the testing, manufacturing, labeling and packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products, and we may be criminally prosecuted. 

We and our third-party manufacturers, distributors and CROs may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, privacy laws and import, export and customs regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. 

FDA Approval Process 

To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates, including vepoloxamer and AIR001. 

The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal testing performed in compliance with FDA regulations; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

submission of an NDA after completion of pivotal clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

possible inspection of selected clinical sites to c onfirm compliance with good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements and data integrity; and &#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the U.S. 

Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

The clinical investigation of an investigational new drug is generally divided into three phases that typically are conducted sequentially, but may overlap. The three phases are as follows: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase 1 . Phase 1 includes initial clinical studies introducing an investigational new drug into humans, and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. The number of participants included in Phase 1 studies is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase 2 . Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Phase 3 . Phase 3 studies are typically expanded trials, which may be controlled or uncontrolled (which refers to a study that does not have a control, or comparison, group). They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product approval. Phase 3 studies usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. 

A clinical study may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA generally requires two or more Phase 3 studies to support approval of a product candidate. A company&#8217;s designation of a clinical study as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. In addition, a clinical study may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the study as being of a particular phase. 

A pivotal study is a clinical study that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate&#8217;s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal studies, to justify regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but they may be Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need. 

Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board, or IRB, generally must approve the clinical trial design and process for obtaining patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may continue based on access to certain data from the study at designated check points. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controll ed and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities , equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements. 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications, together with payment of a significant user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, controls (CMC) and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan drug designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing.

If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. For a standard review, this goal date typically is 12 months from the date of submission of the NDA application. If the NDA application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is designated for priority review, the FDA&#8217;s goal date typically is eight (8) months from the date of NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests, or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. The NDA review process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy after approval. Regulatory approval of products for serious or life-threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 

If the FDA approves any of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. For example, if we change the manufacturer of a product or its API, the FDA may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer, which data will take time and is costly to 

&#160;

&#160;

generate, and the delay associated with generating this data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand, if any. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been appro ved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting d ata from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all. 

We rely on third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material and we expect to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs, should they receive regulatory approval in the future. Future FDA, state and/or foreign governmental agency inspections may identify compliance issues at these third-party facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Many of the foregoing could limit the commercial value of a product or require us to commit substantial additional resources in connection with the approval of an investigational drug. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

Expedited Review Programs 

Investigational drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs may be eligible for certain programs intended to expedite or facilitate the process for FDA review, such as the fast track and priority review designations. Fast track and priority review designations do not change the standards for FDA approval but may expedite the approval process. 

Investigational drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the drug and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a drug with fast track designation, the FDA may consider a &#8220;rolling review&#8221; of the NDA, meaning it may agree to review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, which could expedite the FDA&#8217;s review of the NDA. Fast track designation, however, does not guarantee that the FDA will agree to a rolling review of the NDA. An investigational drug is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an NDA for a drug product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

The Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, provides for granting special status, referred to as orphan designation, to a drug intended to treat, diagnose or prevent a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. at the time of application for orphan designation. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the ODA. Orphan designation must be requested by an applicant before submitting its marketing application for that drug for an orphan disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the orphan drug and its potential use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The first sponsor to receive FDA marketing approval for a drug with an orphan designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product for that indication and, typically, a waiver of the prescription drug user fee for its marketing application. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the U.S. during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of the product candidate must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. 

Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in countries other than the U.S., including the European Union. The legislation in the European Union is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons. The marketing exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

&#160;

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 

Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed healthcare providers, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging drug prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, even if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In the case of products administered in an inpatient hospital setting, a level of payment that is inadequate to cover the cost to hospitals of providing and administering our products to patients, could delay acceptance of or limit our ability to penetrate the markets for our products. 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status for newly approved drug products, including coding, coverage and payment. Sales of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will depend in part on coverage and adequate payment from third-party payors. There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States, therefore coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate payment will be applied consistently or obtained. The process for determining whether a payor will cover and how much it will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. Third-party payor reimbursement to providers of our products, if approved, may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure of administering our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our product(s), there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts.

Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drug products have been a focus in this effort. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. The ACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), included a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, and revised the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Certain provisions of the ACA are not yet, or have only recently become, effective, and others have been temporarily suspended, but the ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 

Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 

It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or abroad, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions federal, state, or commercial payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 

&#160;

&#160;

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In addition to FDA requirements, several other types of state and federal laws apply and will apply to our operations. These laws include, among others, healthcare information and data privacy protection laws, transparency laws, and fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws. 

The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 

Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly promoting their products for uses for which they were not approved and causing the submission of claims for payment for such use under federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.

The federal transparency requirements under the ACA, requires certain manufacturers of drug products, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Compliance with such reporting requirements may be costly. 

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and entities.

Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under federal and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and healthcare program requirements. Although compliance programs and adherence thereto may mitigate the risk of violation of and subsequent investigation and prosecution for violations of the laws described above, the risks cannot be eliminated entirely. In addition, due to the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Government Regulation Outside the U.S. 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process 

&#160;

&#160;

includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S., which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of clinical studies. In Eur ope, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requ irements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under European Union regulatory systems, we would be required to submit a Marketing Authorisation Application, which is similar to the NDA, except that, among other things, there are country-specific document requirements. For countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Our research and development expenses were $28.3 million in 2015 and $19.4 million in 2014. Our research and development expenses for 2015 and 2014 consisted primarily of costs associated with the EPIC study, our Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in heart failure, our discontinued Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in acute limb ischemia, and research-related manufacturing for vepoloxamer and AIR001. See Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report for more information regarding our research and development expenses.
