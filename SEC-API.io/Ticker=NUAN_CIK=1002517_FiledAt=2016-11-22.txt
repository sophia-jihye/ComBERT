Our Strategy 

We have large addressable vertical markets, and we focus on growth by providing industry-leading, value-add solutions for our customers and partners through a broad set of flexible technologies, solutions, and service offerings available directly and through our channel capabilities. The key elements of our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Maintain global leadership in all of our major markets and solutions areas. We have historically targeted markets where we benefit from strong technology, sales and vertical market differentiation. Today, we enjoy a prominent position in the markets we serve, where we are considered one of the leading providers of voice recognition and natural language 

understanding solutions. We invest considerable time and resources to ensure we maintain this position through customer satisfaction, technology leadership, deep domain experience and market specialization. 

&#8226; 

Maintain depth in technology, intellectual property and innovation portfolio. We have built a world-class portfolio of intellectual property, technologies, applications and solutions through both internal development and acquisitions. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to expand our assets, geographic presence, distribution network and customer base through acquisitions of other businesses and technologies. We continue to strengthen our core technologies in voice and language, and expand our offerings through research and innovations in artificial intelligence, cognitive computing and machine learning. 

&#8226; 

Continue to expand our extensive network of global operations, distribution and services networks . &#32;&#32;We market and sell our solutions and technologies directly through a dedicated sales force, through our e-commerce website and also through a global network of resellers, including system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, and telecommunications carriers. In addition, we continue to expand our presence within our markets, such as mobile operators in our Mobile segment, ambulatory markets in our Healthcare segment and new customer services channels in our Enterprise segment, and we have expanded initiatives in geographic markets such as China, Latin America and Southeast Asia. 

&#8226; 

Continue to expand hosting and transaction-based offerings. We are focused on increasing our hosting and transaction-based offerings. Our hosting revenues are generated through on-demand models that typically have multi-year terms with pricing based on volume of usage, number of transactions, number of seats or number of devices. This pricing structure allows customers to use our products at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license. This will enable us to deliver applications that our customers use, and pay for, on a repeat basis, providing us with the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of recurring revenue streams. 

&#8226; 

Maintain significant presence and customer preference in our markets. We specialize in creating large, enterprise-class solutions that are used by many of the world&#8217;s largest companies. By combining our core technology, professional services, local presence and deep domain experience, we are able to deliver these customized offerings for our customers and partners. We have established a trusted position in numerous markets and today work with a majority of the Fortune 100 companies. 

&#8226; 

Strengthen financial profile with improvement in revenue, earnings per share, margin, and cash flow. &#32;&#32; We are focused on improving our financial performance, by further executing upon our formal transformation program, further evolving our business toward recurring revenue models, all of which are positioning us for increased future revenue and profitability growth. In fiscal year 2015 we initiated a formal program to focus our product investments on our growth opportunities, increase our operating efficiencies, reduce costs, and further enhance shareholder value through share buybacks. Our transformation program has delivered measurable results that can be seen in our financial performance and profitability during fiscal 2016.

Competition 

The several markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are subject to rapid technology changes. There are a number of companies that develop or may develop solutions and technologies that compete in our target markets; however, currently there is no one company that directly competes with us across all of our solutions and technologies. While we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants, we believe that we will compete effectively based on many factors, including: 

&#8226; 

Specialized Professional Services. Our superior technology, when coupled with the high quality and domain knowledge of our professional services organization, allows our customers and partners to place a high degree of confidence and trust in our ability to deliver results. We support our customers in designing and building powerful innovative applications that specifically address their needs and requirements. 

&#8226; 

International Coverage. The international reach of our solutions and technologies is due to the broad language coverage of our offerings, including our voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions, which provide recognition for approximately 70 languages and dialects and natural-sounding synthesized speech in over 150 &#32;voices, and support a broad range of hardware platforms and operating systems. Our imaging technology supports more than 120 &#32;languages for OCR and document handling, with up to 20 &#32;screen language choices, including Asian languages. 

&#8226;

We compete with companies such as Adobe, Google, iFlyTek, LivePerson, M*Modal, Optum and 3M. In addition, a number of smaller companies offer solutions, technologies or products that are competitive with our solutions and technologies in the voice recognition, natural language understanding, text input and imaging markets. In certain markets, some of our partners such as Avaya, Cisco, Convergys, and Genesys develop and market products and services that might be considered substitutes for our solutions and technologies. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers. 

Some of our competitors or potential competitors, such as Adobe, Google, and 3M have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had approximately 13,200 full-time employees, including approximately 1,200 &#32;in sales and marketing, approximately 2,700 &#32;in professional services, approximately 1,800 &#32;in research and development, approximately 700 &#32;in general and administrative and approximately 6,800 &#32;who provide transcription and editing services.
