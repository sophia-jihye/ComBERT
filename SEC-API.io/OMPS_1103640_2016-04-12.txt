Subsequently, six retail stores had been opened. On June 30, 2006, however, the Company started to concentrate on its wholesale operation and sold to its majority shareholder &#38; principal executive officer, all the six retail stores. Then on November 30, 2006, the company decided to go back to its original plan of investigate opportunities to be acquired and sold to its majority shareholder the remaining wholesale operation.

Overview of Business 

Omphalos, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries which serve as third-party resellers, supplies a wide range of equipment and parts including refurbished and modified reflow soldering ovens and automated optical inspection machines for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers in Taiwan and China. Omphalos also provides after sale services such as maintenance and repairs to its customers and sells parts for the equipment. 

A reflow oven is a machine used primarily for reflow soldering of surface mount electronic components to printed circuit boards. Reflow soldering represents the most common means to attach a component to a circuit board, and typically consists of applying solder paste, positioning the components, and reflowing the solder in a specialized oven. The goal of the reflow process is to melt the powder particles in the solder paste, with the surfaces being joined together, and solidify the solder to create a strong metallurgical bond. 

The Company serves as third-party reseller, and supplies a wide range of equipment and parts including refurbished and modified reflow soldering ovens and automated optical inspection machines for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers in Taiwan and China. The Company also provides after sale services such as maintenance and repairs to its customers and sells parts for the equipment for that purpose. 

Omphalos markets its products in both Taiwan and China. Omphalos&#146; clients are mainly big name Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giants, including Quanta Computer Inc., Universal Scientific Industrial Co., and Advantech in Taiwan, and QSMC, in China. 

Products 

Omphalos offers a wide range of products, including the following: 

Tamura N2 Reflow Ovens. Omphalos offers the Tamura N2 Reflow Oven as its preferred choice for reflow soldering. The ovens have multiple temperature controlled heat emitting infrared radiation compartments that create a phase change in flux (Small Soldier Particles) turning the solid into a liquid. When cooled in the final compartment, the flux undergoes another phase change turning from a liquid back into a solid forming a bond between the surface mount component and etched circuit board. The Tamura Line takes the additional step of being an oxygen-free environment, instead it utilizes nitrogen gas to minimize oxidation.

Gryphon Laser Marking System. This system is placed at the beginning of the SMT production line where it Laser Etches a Uniquely Identifiable 2-Dimensional Barcode onto the surface of a printed circuit board. 2D barcodes allow for more data to be physically written to the circuit board, usually the threshold is when more than 20 characters need to be written, 2D barcoding is required. The 2D barcode helps to simplify Management Information System (MIS) by making more information available offline, such as an identification number, time of fabrication, plant of fabrication, etc making it easier to track defects and finished products to their final destination. This barcode works best when combined with the Argus Management Information System throughout the fabrication process as its life will be tracked and analyzed. To date, the Company has not derived any significant revenues from this system. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company obtained 28%, 23%, 18%, 15% and 12% of the equipment and parts that it sells to its customers from five local suppliers:Mingray Co., Ltd., Keryi Instruments Co., Ltd., Shingcheng Technology Co., Ltd., Rayjer Machinery Co. Ltd., and Jiamaio Technology Co., Ltd., respectively. These vendors are all Taiwanese companies.

Marketing 

Most of the Omphalos&#146; business is generated through personal relationships with its major customers. In addition, it may participate in trade shows and occasionally run advertisements in trade journals and newspapers. 

Markets and Customers 

Omphalos&#146; customers include a number of major electronic manufacturing companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, only one customer, Delta Electronics Int'l (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. accounted for more than 10% of the Company&#146;s total revenue, represented approximately 84.6% of its total revenue. 

Regulations 

Omphalos is not subject to any significant government regulation that is particular to its business. 

Competition 

Omphalos&#146;s industry is highly competitive. Omphalos believes that its principal direct competitors are the manufacturers of the equipment themselves. These include Japanese companies such as Sayaka, Tamura Furukawa and Ishikawa. 

There are also a number of companies in Asia that resell refurbished equipment. They include Daichi International, Panasonic, Hitachi and Sony Corporation. 

Some of these companies have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as a wider range of products than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have much greater experience in marketing their products, as well as more established relationships with our target customers. Our competitors may also have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to their benefit. As a result, we may have difficulty maintaining our market share. 

We believe that our competitive edge is our responsiveness to our customers&#146; needs, both in terms of speed as well as in our ability to modify the equipment in accordance with the customers&#146; instructions.
