G ENERAL 

We are a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for shelf-stable food and other consumer goods products. We had consolidated net sales of approximately $3.8 billion in 2015. Our products are used for a wide variety of end markets and we operate 89 manufacturing plants in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Our products include: 

&#8226; 

steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products; 

&#8226; 

metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products; and 

&#8226; 

custom designed plastic containers and closures for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. 

We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2015 of slightly more than half of the market. Our leadership in these markets is driven by our high levels of quality, service and technological support, our low cost producer position, our strong long-term customer relationships and our proximity to customers through our widespread geographic presence. We have 47 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. Additionally, we believe that we have the most comprehensive equipment capabilities in the industry. For 2015, our metal container business had net sales of $2.37 billion (approximately 62.8 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $236.4 million (approximately 70.4 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). 

We are also a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products. Our leadership position in closures is a result of our ability to provide customers with high levels of quality, service and technological support. Our closures business provides customers with an extensive variety of proprietary metal, composite and plastic closures that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering. We have 19 closure manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, from which we serve over 70 countries throughout the world. In addition, we license our technology to five other manufacturers for various markets we do not serve directly. For 2015, our closures business had net sales of $805.0 million (approximately 21.4 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $91.8 million (approximately 27.3 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). 

Additionally, we are a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets. Our success in the plastic packaging market is largely due to our demonstrated ability to provide our customers with high levels of quality, service and technological support, along with our value-added design-focused products and our extensive geographic presence with 23 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. We produce plastic containers from a full range of resin materials and offer a comprehensive array of molding and decorating capabilities.

Our customer base includes some of the world&#8217;s best-known branded consumer products companies. Our philosophy has been to develop long-term customer relationships by acting in partnership with our customers by providing reliable quality, service and technological support and utilizing our low cost producer position. The strength of our customer relationships is evidenced by our large number of multi-year supply arrangements, our high retention of customers&#8217; business and our continued recognition from customers, as demonstrated by the many quality and service awards we have received. We estimate that in 2016 approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales in North America, a majority of our projected closures sales in the United States and a majority of our projected plastic container sales will be under multi-year customer supply arrangements. 

Our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs and build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We believe that we will accomplish this goal because of 

our leading market positions and management expertise in acquiring, financing, integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses. 

O UR &#32;H ISTORY

O UR &#32;S TRATEGY 

We intend to enhance our position as a leading manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products by continuing to aggressively pursue a strategy designed to achieve future growth and increase shareholder value by focusing on the following key elements: 

S UPPLY &#32;&#8220;B EST &#32;V ALUE &#8221; P ACKAGING &#32;P RODUCTS &#32;W ITH &#32;H IGH &#32;L EVELS &#32; OF &#32;Q UALITY , S ERVICE &#32; AND &#32;T ECHNOLOGICAL &#32;S UPPORT 

Since our inception, we have been, and intend to continue to be, devoted to consistently supplying our products with the combination of quality, price and service that our customers consider to be &#8220;best value.&#8221; In our metal container business, we focus on providing high quality and high levels of service and utilizing our low cost producer position. We have made and are continuing to make significant capital investments to offer our customers value-added features such as our family of Quick Top &#174; &#32;easy-open ends for our metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments for our Can Vision 2020 SM &#32;program, which investments are intended to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In our closures business, we emphasize high levels of quality, service and technological support. We believe our closures business is the premier innovative closures solutions provider to the food and beverage industry by offering customers an extensive variety of metal, composite and plastic closures, as well as proprietary equipment solutions such as cap feeders, cappers and detection systems to ensure high quality package safety. In our plastic container business, we provide high levels of quality and service and focus on value-added, custom designed plastic containers to meet changing product and packaging demands of our customers. We believe that we are one of the few plastic packaging businesses that can custom design, manufacture and decorate a wide variety of plastic containers, providing the customer with the ability to satisfy more of its plastic packaging needs through one supplier. We will continue to supply customized products that can be delivered quickly to our customers with superior levels of design, development and technological support. 

M AINTAIN &#32;L OW &#32;C OST &#32;P RODUCER &#32;P OSITION 

We will continue pursuing opportunities to strengthen our low cost position in our business by: 

&#8226; 

maintaining a flat, efficient organizational structure, resulting in low selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales; 

&#8226; 

achieving and maintaining economies of scale; 

&#8226; 

prudently investing in new technologies to increase manufacturing and production efficiency; 

&#8226; 

rationalizing our existing plant structure; and 

&#8226; 

serving our customers from our strategically located plants. 

Through our metal container facilities, we believe that we provide the most comprehensive manufacturing capabilities in the industry. Through our closures business, we manufacture an extensive variety of metal, composite and plastic closures for the food and beverage industry throughout the world utilizing state-of-the-art technology and equipment, and we provide our customers with state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems. Through our plastic container facilities, we have the capacity to manufacture customized products across the entire spectrum of resin materials, decorating techniques and molding processes required by our customers. We intend to leverage our manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities to continue to create cost-effective manufacturing systems that will drive our improvements in product quality, operating efficiency and customer support. 

In 2015, we initiated optimization plans in each of our businesses, which plans were designed to reduce manufacturing and logistical costs and provide productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. The optimization plans include the construction of a new metal container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. Our closures business successfully completed the execution of its optimization plan in 2015. Our metal and plastic container businesses are continuing the implementation of their optimization plans, including construction of the new manufacturing facilities. 

M AINTAIN &#32; AN &#32;O PTIMAL &#32;C APITAL &#32;S TRUCTURE &#32; TO &#32;S UPPORT &#32;G ROWTH &#32; AND &#32;I NCREASE &#32;S HAREHOLDER &#32;V ALUE 

Our financial strategy is to use reasonable leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our shareholders or for other permitted purposes. In 2013, we used cash on hand, revolving loan borrowings under a previous senior secured credit facility, or our 2011 Credit Facility, and other foreign bank revolving loans to fund repurchases of our common stock for $267.6 million (which included $250.0 million of our common stock purchased pursuant to a "modified Dutch auction" tender offer completed in February 2013), the purchase price for our acquisitions of Portola Packaging, Inc. and its subsidiaries, or Portola, the metal vacuum closures operations in Australia of Amcor Limited, or Amcor Australia Metal Closures, and the U.S. metal vacuum closures operations of Tecnocap S.p.A. and Tecnocap LLC, or Tecnocap U.S. Metal Closures, and the repayment of $300.9 million of term loans under our 2011 Credit Facility. In addition, we issued $300 million of 5&#189;% Senior Notes due 2022, or the 5&#189;% Notes, in September 2013, the net proceeds of which were used to repay revolving loans under our 2011 Credit Facility. In January 2014, we refinanced our 2011 Credit Facility with our new senior secured credit facility, or our Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement refinanced all outstanding amounts under our 2011 Credit Facility and provides us with a $985.6 million multicurrency revolving loan facility and a Cdn $15.0 million revolving loan facility for working capital requirements and other strategic initiatives. In September 2014, we funded the purchase price for the metal container manufacturing assets of Van Can Company, or Van Can, with cash on hand. In 2015, we used cash on hand and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to fund repurchases of our common stock for $170.1 million (which included $161.8 million of our common stock purchased pursuant to a "modified Dutch auction" tender offer completed in March 2015). 

E XPAND &#32;T HROUGH &#32;A CQUISITIONS &#32; AND &#32;I NTERNAL &#32;G ROWTH 

We intend to continue to increase our market share in our current business lines and related business lines through acquisitions and internal growth. We use a disciplined approach to make acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. As a result, we expect to continue to expand and diversify our customer base, geographic presence and product lines. This strategy has enabled us to increase our net sales and income from operations over the last ten years. For example, in September 2014, we acquired the metal container manufacturing assets of Van Can, which expanded and diversified the customer base, geographic presence and product lines of our metal container business in the United States. 

We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During the past 29 years, the metal food container market in North America has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestl&#233; Food Company, or Nestl&#233;, The Dial Corporation, or Dial, Del Monte Corporation, or Del Monte, Birds Eye Foods, Inc., or Birds Eye, Campbell Soup Company, or Campbell, Pacific Coast Producers, or Pacific Coast, and Nestl&#233; Purina PetCare's steel container self-manufacturing assets, or Purina Steel Can, reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately six percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers. 

While we have expanded our metal container business and increased our market share of metal containers primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers, we have also made over the last several years, and are continuing to make, significant capital investments in our metal container business to enhance our business and offer our customers value-added features, such as our family of Quick Top &#174; &#32;easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2015, approximately 60 percent of our metal food containers sold had an easy-open end. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments for our Can Vision 2020 SM program, which investments are intended to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2015, we commenced construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility in Burlington, Iowa to better optimize the logistical footprint of our metal container operations in North America, allowing us to further reduce costs of our metal container business. The construction of this facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 

With our acquisitions of our closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products, with leadership positions in the North American and European markets. In 2013, we expanded the geographic scope, product offerings and scale of our closures business with the acquisitions of Portola, Amcor Australia Metal Closures and Tecnocap U.S. Metal Closures. We may pursue further consolidation opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our closures business, particularly in plastic closures. In making investments to pursue internal growth, we use a disciplined approach to generate attractive cash returns. 

We have grown our market position for our plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing sevenfold to $593.7 million in 2015. We achieved this improvement primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. In 2012, we completed the strategic acquisition of the plastic food container operations of Rexam PLC now operating under the name Silgan Plastic Food Containers, or PFC, broadening our product offerings for shelf-stable food products to include plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays. As part of the acquisition of Portola in 2013, we acquired three plastic container manufacturing facilities in Canada, further expanding the geographic scope and product offerings of our plastic container business. In 2015, we commenced construction of two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, including a near-site facility to a major customer and another facility to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. These new facilities are located in North East, Pennsylvania and Hazelwood, Missouri. The construction of these facilities is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. The plastic containers segment of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, and we intend to pursue further consolidation opportunities in this market. Over the long term, we also expect to continue to generate internal growth in our plastic container business. As with acquisitions, we use a disciplined approach to pursue internal growth to generate attractive cash returns. Through a combination of these efforts, we intend to continue to expand our customer base in the markets that we serve, such as the personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical markets. 

E NHANCE &#32;P ROFITABILITY &#32;T HROUGH &#32;P RODUCTIVITY &#32;I MPROVEMENTS &#32; AND &#32;C OST &#32;R EDUCTIONS 

We intend to continue to enhance profitability through investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions, and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. The additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings. From 2011, we have closed two metal container manufacturing facilities, two closure manufacturing facilities and five plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. In addition, we have announced the shutdown of two metal container manufacturing facilities and two plastic container manufacturing facilities that we expect to close during 2016. 

We expect that most future acquisitions will continue to enable us to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and other benefits from economies of scale and the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions. In addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses, we have improved and expect to continue to improve the operating performance of our plant facilities by investing capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions. While we have made some of these investments in certain of our plants, more opportunities still exist throughout our system. We will continue to use a disciplined approach to identify these opportunities to generate attractive cash returns. 

In 2015, we initiated optimization plans in each of our businesses that were designed to reduce manufacturing and logistical costs and provide productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. The optimization plans include the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. Our closures business successfully completed the execution of its optimization plan in 2015. Our metal and plastic container businesses are continuing the implementation of their optimization plans, including construction of the new manufacturing facilities. 

B USINESS &#32;S EGMENTS 

We are a holding company that conducts our business through various operating subsidiaries. We operate three businesses, our metal container business, our closures business and our plastic container business. 

M ETAL &#32;C ONTAINERS &#8212;62.8 PERCENT &#32; OF &#32; OUR &#32; CONSOLIDATED &#32; NET &#32; SALES &#32; IN &#32;2015 

We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2015 of slightly more than half of the market. Our metal container business is engaged in the manufacture and sale of steel and aluminum containers that are used primarily by processors and packagers for food products, such as soup, vegetables, fruit, meat, tomato based products, seafood, coffee, adult nutritional drinks, pet food and other miscellaneous food products, as well as general line metal containers primarily for chemicals. We have 47 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. For 2015, our metal container business had net sales of $2.37 billion (approximately 62.8 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $236.4 million (approximately 70.4 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected North American metal container sales in 2016 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements. 

Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe metal containers are superior to plastic, paper and composite containers in applications where the contents are prepared at high temperatures, or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities, or where the long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product&#8217;s quality. We also believe that metal containers are generally more desirable than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport. Additionally, while the market for metal food containers in the United States has experienced little or no growth over the last ten years, we have increased our market share of metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions, such as our recent acquisition of Van Can, and growth with existing customers, and have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high quality, high levels of service and value-added features such as our family of Quick Top &#174; &#32;easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments for our Can Vision 2020 SM &#32;program, which investments are intended to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2015, we commenced construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility in the United States to better optimize the logistical footprint of our metal container business in North America. This new facility will allow us to further reduce costs of our metal container business. The construction of this facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 

C LOSURES &#8212;21.4 PERCENT &#32; OF &#32; OUR &#32; CONSOLIDATED &#32; NET &#32; SALES &#32; IN &#32;2015 

We are a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products. Our closures business provides customers with an extensive variety of proprietary metal, composite and 

plastic closures that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering. We have 19 closure manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, from which we serve over 70 countries throughout the world. In addition, we license our technology to five other manufacturers for various markets we do not serve directly. For 2015, our closures business had net sales of $805.0 million (approximately 21.4 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $91.8 million (approximately 27.3 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). 

We manufacture metal, composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products, such as juices and juice drinks, ready-to-drink teas, sports and energy drinks, dairy products, ketchup, salsa, pickles, tomato sauce, soup, cooking sauces, gravies, fruits, vegetables, preserves, baby food, baby juices and infant formula products. We provide customers of our closures business with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed to minimize removal torques and to enhance openability of our closures while meeting applicable regulatory requirements. We offer our customers an extensive range of printing options for our closures. We also provide customers with sealing/capping equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering for food and beverage products. As a result of our extensive range of closures, our geographic presence and our focus on providing high levels of quality, service and technological support, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to serve food and beverage product companies for their closure needs. 

P LASTIC &#32;C ONTAINERS &#8212;15.8 PERCENT &#32; OF &#32; OUR &#32; CONSOLIDATED &#32; NET &#32; SALES &#32; IN &#32;2015 

We produce plastic containers from a full range of resin materials and offer a comprehensive array of molding and decorating capabilities. We are one of the leading manufacturers of custom designed high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, containers for the personal care market in North America. Through our acquisition of PFC, we are also a leading manufacturer in North America of plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for shelf-stable food products. We operate 23 plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. For 2015, our plastic container business had net sales of $593.7 million (approximately 15.8 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $7.8 million (approximately 2.3 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). Since 1987, we have improved our market position for our plastic container business, with net sales increasing sevenfold. 

We manufacture custom designed and stock plastic containers for personal care and health care products, including containers for mouthwash, shampoos, conditioners, hand creams, lotions, liquid soap, respiratory and gastrointestinal products, cosmetics and toiletries; food and beverage products, including peanut butter, salad dressings, condiments, dairy products, powdered drink mixes and liquor; household and industrial chemical products, including containers for scouring cleaners, cleaning agents and lawn, garden and agricultural products; and pharmaceutical products, including containers for tablets and antacids. We also manufacture plastic closures, caps, sifters and fitments for food and household products, including salad dressings, peanut butter, spices, liquid margarine, powdered drink mixes and arts and crafts supplies. In addition, we manufacture plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for food products, such as soups and other ready-to-eat meals and pet food, as well as thermoformed plastic tubs for personal care and household products, including soft fabric wipes. 

Our leading position in the plastic container market is largely driven by our rapid response to our customers&#8217; design, development and technology support needs and our value-added, diverse product line. This product line is the result of our ability to produce plastic containers from a full range of resin materials using a broad array of manufacturing, molding and decorating capabilities. We benefit from our large scale and nationwide presence, as significant consolidation is occurring in many of our customers&#8217; markets. Through these capabilities, we are well-positioned to serve our customers, who demand customized solutions as they continue to seek innovative means to differentiate their products in the marketplace using packaging. In 2015, we commenced construction of two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States, including a near-site facility to a major customer and another facility to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. The construction of these facilities is expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 

M ANUFACTURING &#32; AND &#32;P RODUCTION 

As is the practice in the industry, most of our customers provide us with quarterly or annual estimates of products and quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. These estimates enable us to effectively manage production and control working capital requirements. We schedule our production to meet customers&#8217;

The manufacturing operations of our metal container business include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating, assembling and packaging finished cans. We use three basic processes to produce cans. The traditional three-piece method requires three pieces of flat metal to form a cylindrical body with a welded 

side seam, a bottom and a top. High integrity of the side seam is assured by the use of sophisticated electronic weld monitors and organic coatings that are thermally cured by induction and convection processes. The other two methods of producing cans start by forming a shallow cup that is then formed into the desired height using either the draw and iron process or the draw and redraw process. Using the draw and redraw process, we manufacture steel and aluminum two-piece cans, the height of which generally does not exceed the diameter. For cans the height of which is greater than the diameter, we manufacture steel two-piece cans by using a drawing and ironing process. Quality and stackability of these cans are comparable to that of the shallow two-piece cans described above. We manufacture can bodies and ends from thin, high-strength aluminum alloys and steels by utilizing proprietary tool and die designs and selected can making equipment. We also manufacture our Quick Top &#174; &#32;easy-open ends from both steel and aluminum alloys in a sophisticated precision progressive die process. We regularly review our Quick Top &#174; &#32;easy-open end designs for improvements for optimum consumer preference through consumer studies and feedback.

The manufacturing operations for metal closures include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating and lining. We manufacture twist-off, lug style and press-on, twist-off steel closures and aluminum roll-on closures for glass, metal and plastic containers, ranging in size from 18 to 110 millimeters in diameter. We employ state-of-the-art multi-die presses to manufacture metal closures, offering a low-cost, high quality means of production. We also provide customers of our closures business with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed to minimize torque removal and enhance the openability of our closures while meeting applicable regulatory requirements. 

We utilize two basic processes to produce plastic closures. In the injection molded process, pellets of plastic resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming a plastic closure shell. The shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated, compression molded sealing system. The shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In the compression molded process, pellets of plastic resin are heated and extruded, and then compressed to form a plastic closure shell. The shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated, compression molded sealing system. The shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In either process, the shell can also be lined with foil seal systems formulated for its end use. 

For composite closures, a metal panel is manufactured using the same manufacturing process for metal closures, including the use of custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, and then it is inserted into a plastic closure shell.

We utilize two basic processes to produce plastic containers. In the extrusion blowmolding process, pellets of plastic resin are heated and extruded into a tube of plastic. A two-piece metal mold is then closed around the plastic tube and high pressure air is blown into it causing a bottle to form in the mold&#8217;s shape. In the injection and injection stretch blowmolding processes, pellets of plastic resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming a plastic preform. The plastic preform is then blown into a bottle-shaped metal mold, creating a plastic bottle. 

We also manufacture plastic closures, caps, sifters and fitments using runnerless injection molding technology. In this process, pellets of plastic resin are melted and forced under pressure into a mold, where they take the mold&#8217;s shape. 

Our plastic thermoformed bowls, trays and tubs are manufactured by melting pellets of plastic resin into an extruded plastic sheet. The plastic sheet is then formed in a mold to make the plastic bowl, tray or tub. 

We have state-of-the-art decorating equipment, including several of the largest sophisticated decorating facilities in the United States. Our decorating methods for plastic containers are in-mold labeling, which applies a plastic film label to the bottle during the blowing process, and post-mold decoration. Post-mold decoration includes: 

&#8226; 

silk screen decoration which enables the applications of images in multiple colors to the bottle; 

&#8226; 

pressure sensitive decoration which uses a plastic film or paper label with an adhesive; 

&#8226; 

heat transfer decoration which uses a plastic coated label applied by heat; 

&#8226; 

hot stamping decoration which transfers images from a die using metallic foils; and 

&#8226; 

shrink sleeve labeling. 

R AW &#32;M ATERIALS 

Based upon our existing arrangements with suppliers and our current and anticipated requirements, we believe that we have made adequate provisions for acquiring our raw materials. As a result of significant consolidation of suppliers, we are, however, dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for our steel, aluminum, coatings and compound raw materials. Increases in the prices of raw materials have generally been passed along to our customers in accordance with our multi-year customer supply arrangements and through general price increases. 

M ETAL &#32;C ONTAINER &#32;B USINESS 

We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, copper wire, organic coatings, lining compound and inks in the manufacture and decoration of our metal container products. Although there has been significant consolidation of suppliers, we believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials for the foreseeable future. 

Our metal container supply arrangements with our customers in the United States provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our non-contract domestic customers, we have also generally increased prices to pass through increases in our metal costs. In Europe, most supply arrangements are negotiated annually, and we generally pass along changes in our raw material costs to customers. Although no assurances can be given, we expect to be able to purchase sufficient quantities of metal to timely meet all of our customers&#8217; requirements in 2016. 

Our material requirements are supplied through agreements and purchase orders with suppliers with whom we have long-term relationships. If our suppliers fail to deliver under their arrangements, we would be forced to purchase raw materials on the open market, and no assurances can be given that we would be able to purchase such raw materials or, if we are so able, that we would be able to purchase such raw materials at comparable prices or terms.

We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, organic coatings, low-metallic inks and pulpboard, plastic and organic lining materials in the manufacture of metal closures. 

We use resins in pellet form, such as homopolymer polypropylene, copolymer polypropylene and HDPE, thermoplastic elastomer lining materials, processing additives and colorants in the manufacture of plastic closures. 

Our domestic closures operations have generally passed along to customers changes in the prices of metal and resin raw materials in accordance with supply arrangements. For non-contract customers, our domestic closures operations have also generally passed through changes in our metal and resin costs. In Europe, most supply arrangements are negotiated annually, and we generally pass along changes in our raw material costs to customers. Although no assurances can be given, we believe we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials for the foreseeable future, despite the significant consolidation of suppliers.

The raw materials we use in our plastic container business are primarily resins in pellet form such as virgin HDPE, virgin PET, recycled HDPE, recycled PET, polypropylene and, to a lesser extent, polystyrene, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, polyvinyl chloride and medium density polyethylene. Our resin 

requirements are acquired through multi-year arrangements for specific quantities of resins with several major suppliers of resins. The price that we pay for resin raw materials is not fixed and is subject to market pricing, which has fluctuated significantly in the past few years. Our plastic container business has passed along to our customers changes in the prices of our resin raw materials in accordance with customer supply arrangements. 

We believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of resins for the foreseeable future, absent unforeseen events such as significant hurricanes. 

S ALES &#32; AND &#32;M ARKETING 

Our philosophy has been to develop long-term customer relationships by acting in partnership with our customers, providing reliable quality and service. We market our products primarily by a direct sales force and for our plastic container business, in part, through a network of distributors. Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal container business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants. 

Approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales were to Nestl&#233; in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total consolidated net sales during those years.

We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2015 of slightly more than half of the market. We have 47 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. Our largest customers for these products include Bonduelle Group, Campbell, Chicken of the Sea, ConAgra Foods, Inc., Del Monte, General Mills, Inc., Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kraft Heinz Company, Mars, Incorporated, Nestl&#233;, Pacific Coast, Pinnacle Foods Group LLC, Stanislaus Food Products Company and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. 

We have entered into multi-year supply arrangements with many of our customers, including Nestl&#233;, Campbell and other food producers. We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected North American metal container sales in 2016 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements. Historically, we have been successful in continuing these multi-year customer supply arrangements. In Europe, our metal container business has had long-term relationships with many of its customers, although, as is common practice, many supply arrangements are negotiated on a year-by-year basis. 

Since our inception in 1987, we have supplied Nestl&#233; with substantially all of its U.S. metal food container requirements purchased from third party manufacturers. Our net sales of metal food containers to Nestl&#233; in 2015 were $416.9 million. We have a supply agreement with Nestl&#233; for a substantial portion of the metal food containers we supply Nestl&#233;, which agreement runs through December 2019. In September 2011, we acquired Purina Steel Can from Nestl&#233; and consolidated such assets into our existing metal container facilities in the United States. In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Nestl&#233; that runs through December 2021 for the steel container volume previously manufactured by Purina Steel Can. In addition to these supply agreements, other metal food containers that we sell to Nestl&#233; are supplied pursuant to a shorter-term supply agreement. Each of these supply agreements provide for certain prices and specify that those prices will be increased or decreased based upon cost change formulas. 

Our metal container business&#8217; sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. You should also read &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;The seasonality of the fruit and vegetable packing industry causes us to incur short-term debt&#8221; included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We are also a leading manufacturer in North America of plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for shelf-stable food products. We market our plastic containers and closures in most areas of North America through a direct sales force and a large network of distributors. We also market certain stock plastic containers for personal care and health care products through an on-line shopping catalog. 

Our largest customers for our plastic container business include Bayer AG, Berlin Packaging LLC, Campbell, The Clorox Company, ConAgra Foods, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Johnson &#38; Johnson, Kraft Heinz Company, Mars, Incorporated, McCormick &#38; Company, Inc., The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, The Scotts Company LLC, The Sun Products Corporation, TreeHouse Foods, Inc., TricorBraun and Vi-Jon Laboratories, Inc. 

We have arrangements to sell some of our plastic containers and closures to distributors, who in turn resell those products primarily to regional customers. Plastic containers sold to distributors are generally manufactured by using generic and custom molds with decoration added to meet the end users&#8217; requirements. The distributors&#8217; warehouses and their sales personnel enable us to market and inventory a wide range of such products to a variety of customers. 

We have written purchase orders or contracts for the supply of containers with the majority of our customers. In general, these purchase orders and contracts are for containers made from proprietary molds and are for a duration of one to five years. 

C OMPETITION 

The packaging industry is highly competitive. We compete in this industry with manufacturers of similar and other types of packaging, as well as fillers, food processors and packers who manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. We attempt to compete effectively through the quality of our products, competitive pricing and our ability to meet customer requirements for delivery, performance and technical assistance. 

M ETAL &#32;C ONTAINER &#32;B USINESS 

Of the commercial metal container manufacturers, Ardagh Group, Ball Corporation and Crown Holdings, Inc. are our most significant competitors. Our competitors also include other regional suppliers. As an alternative to purchasing containers from commercial can manufacturers, customers have the ability to invest in equipment to self-manufacture their containers. 

Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal container business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants. Strategically located existing plants give us an advantage over competitors from other areas, but we could be potentially disadvantaged by the relocation of a major customer. 

Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe that metal containers are superior to plastic, composite and paper containers in applications, where the contents 

are prepared at high temperatures or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities or where long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product&#8217;s quality. We also believe that metal containers are more desirable generally than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport.

Our labor contracts expire at various times between 2016 and 2018. As of December 31, 2015, contracts covering approximately 15 percent of our hourly employees in the United States and Canada will expire during 2016. We expect no significant changes in our relations with these unions. 

E NVIRONMENTAL &#32; AND &#32;O THER &#32;R EGULATIONS 

We are subject to federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In general, these laws and regulations limit the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. We believe that we are either in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable environmental laws and regulations or are operating in accordance with appropriate variances, schedules under compliance orders or similar arrangements. 

In addition to costs associated with regulatory compliance, we may be held liable for alleged environmental damage associated with the past disposal of hazardous substances. Those that generate hazardous substances that are disposed of at sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and other classes of persons, are subject to claims for clean up and natural resource damages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. CERCLA and many similar state and foreign statutes may hold a responsible party liable for the entire cleanup cost at a particular site even though that party may not have caused the entire problem. Other state statutes may impose proportionate rather than joint and several liability. The federal Environmental Protection Agency or a state or foreign agency may also issue orders requiring responsible parties to undertake removal or remedial actions at sites. 

We are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and other federal, foreign, state and local laws regulating noise exposure levels and other safety and health concerns in the production areas of our plants. 

While management does not believe that any of the regulatory matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial position or competitive position, we cannot assure you that a material environmental or other regulatory claim will not arise in the future.
