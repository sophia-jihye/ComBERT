 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Approximately 70% of the earth&#8217;s surface is covered by water, with approximately 44% of the world&#8217;s population living within approximately 150 miles of a coast. Thousands of systems are deployed in the oceans today to increase our understanding of weather, climate change, biological processes, and marine mammal patterns and to support exploration and operations for industries such as oil and gas. Most of these systems are powered by battery, solar, wind, fuel cell, or fossil fuel generators that are expensive to operate while also limited in their electric power delivery. Most of these systems require significant tradeoffs in sensor accuracy, data processing and data communications bandwidth and frequency in order to operate within the available power. More persistent power systems requiring less maintenance may have the ability to save costs over current operating systems. Just as importantly, increases in available power may allow for better sensors, and shorter data sampling and data communication intervals which could as a result improve scientific and economic returns. 

&#160; 

Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Pennington, NJ, Ocean Power Technologies seeks to become a leader in ocean wave power. We are developing and seeking to commercialize our proprietary systems that generate electricity by harnessing the renewable energy of ocean waves. Our PowerBuoy &#174; systems use proprietary technologies that convert the mechanical energy created by the heaving motion of ocean waves into electricity. We currently have designed and are seeking to commercialize and continue to develop our PowerBuoy product line which is based on modular, ocean-going buoys, which we have been periodically ocean testing since 1997. 

&#160; 

We have designed our autonomous PowerBuoy to generate power for use in remote locations, independent of an existing power grid. Our current product offering, an autonomous PowerBuoy, incorporates a unique power take-off (&#8220;PTO&#8221;) and onboard system for energy storage and management, and is significantly smaller than our previous iteration utility scale PowerBuoy. We are continuing to develop and test our PowerBuoys, which we believe could be utilized in a variety of applications. While we believe that we have validated our autonomous PowerBuoy and subsystems through factory and in-ocean tests, we are continuing to develop our PowerBuoy and product offerings, and only beginning to seek to commercialize our products and therefore, we cannot assure you that our products will operate as designed or provide our potential customers with a cost-effective alternative source of in-ocean power for all applications. In our current PowerBuoy design, we are leveraging portions of earlier designs and features that we do not believe require further validation prior to implementation in our current products. Currently, our product development and engineering efforts are focusing primarily on developing technologies that will increase the energy output and reliability of our product, while also seeking to ensure design scalability to meet the power demands in our targeted markets. Our marketing and development efforts are targeting applications that require reliable, persistent, and sustainable power sources operating independently of the utility grid. We also seek to supply electric power to payloads that are integrated directly in our PowerBuoy and/or located in its vicinity when deployed in the ocean, including on the seabed. Based on our market research and available public data, our management believes that there is the potential for us to pursue business opportunities in multiple markets that would have a direct need for our PowerBuoys including oil and gas, ocean observing, defense and security, communications, offshore wind, and ocean aquaculture. Depending on power needs, sensor types and other considerations, we believe our PowerBuoy could have the ability to satisfy several application requirements within these markets. We believe that our current PowerBuoy product, the PB3, generates sufficient persistent power to meet the application needs of many of the potential customers within our target markets, but we also believe that we will need to increase the energy output of the PowerBuoy to generate the power required for other applications within these markets and are seeking to do so with our continued research and development efforts. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to seek commercial adoption of our PowerBuoy and related services. 

&#160; 

Since fiscal 2002, government agencies have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. These revenues were largely for the support of our development efforts relating to our technology and development of our PowerBuoys. Our goal is that an increased portion of our revenues be from the sale or lease of our products and sales of services, as compared to revenue from grants to support our business operations. As we continue to develop and commercialize our products, we expect to have a net loss of cash from operating activities unless and until we achieve positive cash flow from the commercialization of our products and services. During fiscal 2015 and 2016, we continued work on projects with the U.S. Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;), and Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (&#8220;MES&#8221;), and we continued our efforts to increase the reliability and power output of our PowerBuoys. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in April 1984 and began commercial operations in 1994. On April 23, 2007, we reincorporated in Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 1590 Reed Road, Pennington, New Jersey 08534, and our telephone number is (609) 730-0400. Our website address is www.oceanpowertechnologies.com. We make available free of charge on our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). The information on our website is not a part of this Annual Report. Our common stock has been listed on NASDAQ since April 24, 2007, the date on which we completed our initial public offering in the United States, and since July 2015, our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our fiscal year begins on May 1 and ends on April 30. When we refer to a particular fiscal year, we are referring to the fiscal year ending on April 30 of that year. For example, fiscal 2016 refers to the fiscal year beginning on May 1, 2015 and ending on April 30, 2016. Other fiscal years follow similarly.

&#160; 

Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We are currently seeking to commercialize our PowerBuoy by targeting customers principally in six markets (as discussed in further detail below) that require reliable, persistent, and sustainable power sources operating independently of the utility grid. We believe that our technology for generating electricity from wave energy and our commercial relationships may offer the following potential competitive advantages in the markets we are targeting for commercial sales and leases of our PowerBuoy and related products and services. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

O cean-tested technology to generate electricity. We have conducted a number of ocean tests of our PowerBuoy since 1997 seeking to test and demonstrate the viability of our technology. Several ocean trials of our larger scale prototype PowerBuoys were conducted between 2005 and 2011, and we conducted an ocean test of our autonomous PowerBuoy, a previous iteration of our current autonomous PowerBuoy, under a contract with the U.S. Navy. We believe that these tests support the use of our technology as a potential persistent power source for systems requiring remote power at sea. Our PowerBuoy structure is designed to be durable and has survived hurricanes and winter storms while deployed in the ocean. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

E fficient design in harnessing wave energy. We have designed our PowerBuoys to optimize the power generated for a given location through efficient mechanical to electrical wave energy conversion. We have designed the onboard energy storage system (&#8220;ESS&#8221;) to provide several days of continuous rated power during low or no wave periods. Our PowerBuoy is equipped with a variety of communication capabilities including satellite, cellular, and Wi-Fi, and can also accommodate other capabilities such as high frequency communication. Our PowerBuoy is capable of transmitting real-time data, which is collected by its various payloads (e.g., sensors or equipment that require power and communications capabilities). 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Numerous applications within multiple, major market segments. We have designed our PowerBuoy systems to work in multiple offshore applications around the world. In particular, we are targeting our marketing to customers with potential applications in the oil and gas, ocean observing, defense and security, offshore wind, communications, and ocean aquaculture industries. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

P rior commercial relationships enabled the development of our technology. Our prior relationships with the U.S. Navy, DOE, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security have allowed us to develop our PowerBuoys, which we believe enhances our market visibility and attractiveness to our prospective customers. We believe that our projects with the DOE, the U.S. Navy, MES, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security provided us with an initial opportunity to develop our PowerBuoys and we are seeking to leverage these relationships in our efforts to commercialize our PowerBuoys for use where autonomous power could potentially improve existing applications and enable new ones. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Greater power compared to certain existing , incumbent solutions. We believe that our PowerBuoy may provide more power than certain existing battery, solar, and other powered systems, enabling additional sensors to be employed or a higher rate of data transmission, and/or extend the period during which the application can be employed on the ocean. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Potentially considerable life cycle cost savings over incumbent solutions. Our PowerBuoy systems are designed to operate over extended intervals between required servicing as compared to battery-powered or other systems which we believe generally require more frequent recharging or replacement. We have developed several case studies around various ocean observing applications which, in our opinion, illustrate that our PowerBuoy system may reduce costs over multi-year operation of an application as compared with incumbent solutions, mostly due to lower vessel and personnel servicing costs associated with the retrieval and redeployment of current battery-powered solutions. We also believe that our enhanced communication capabilities may provide further value to potential end users by enabling proactive mission critical-decision making based on data transmitted in real-time. We believe that longer operating intervals between servicing has the potential to provide life cycle savings for certain applications. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Modular and scalable designs. Our PowerBuoy systems are designed with a modular energy storage system (&#8220;ESS&#8221;) which we believe will allow us to tailor the PowerBuoy configuration to the specific needs of the end-user and therefore offer a cost effective solution, while also allowing us to expand the energy storage capacity within the PowerBuoy depending on the power requirements of specific applications. We believe this could be accomplished by integrating energy storage modules into the PowerBuoy, potentially eliminating the need for alterations or customization and providing both flexibility and cost-effectiveness to the end-user. We also believe that our PowerBuoys might also be installed in an array in order to achieve higher levels of aggregate power generation, although we have not done so to date. Additionally, we believe that our PowerBuoy technology and designs may be scalable to higher power levels. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Real-time data communications. Some incumbent solutions which have less available power than our PowerBuoy may have limited communication capabilities or may be able to communicate data only over shorter periods due to data transmission power requirements. Some incumbent solutions may only make data accessible upon physical retrieval of or from the sensor. Our PowerBuoys can be equipped with a variety of communications equipment, which enables the transmission of data on a more frequent basis than many incumbent solutions or even on a real-time basis and on-demand. We believe that more frequent data communication could enable an end-user to make data-driven decisions more quickly. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Flexible electrical, mechanical and communication interfaces for sensors. Our PowerBuoys can be equipped with sensor packages and also provide capability for the addition of sensors, either mounted directly on or within the PowerBuoy, or tethered to the PowerBuoy. Our PowerBuoys have mechanical and electrical interfaces which may allow for simplified integration of sensors by us, the end-user, or a third party. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Standard transportation and deployment. The size and weight of our autonomous PowerBuoy allows for transportation and handling using conventional means. Our autonomous PowerBuoy can fit in a standard 40 foot shipping container which may result in significantly lower transportation and deployment costs compared to earlier iterations of our utility scale PowerBuoy. Our autonomous PowerBuoy can be transported using conventional vessels, and can be lifted using conventional marine cranes. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

E nvironmentally benign and aesthetically non-intrusive system design . &#160; We believe that our PowerBuoy does not present significant risks to marine life, or emit significant levels of pollutants, and therefore has minimal environmental impact. For example, in connection with our project at the U.S. Marine Corps Base in Hawaii in 2003, the U.S. Navy obtained an independent environmental assessment of our PowerBuoy prior to installation, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. This assessment resulted in a &#8220;Finding of No Significant Impact,&#8221; the highest rating obtainable by the assessor. In addition, in 2011, we received a &#8220;Finding of No Significant Impact&#8221; from the DOE after an environmental assessment in connection with our Reedsport, Oregon project. Since our PowerBuoys are typically located far offshore, they are usually not visible from land. We believe that our PowerBuoy has only a minimal visual and audible impact, where only a small portion of the unit is visible at close range, with the bulk of the unit being hidden below the surface of the water. We believe there is no significant audible impact and such systems have not been shown to have a negative effect on marine life. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Business Strategy &#160; 

&#160; 

As part of our strategic pivot in operations initiated in fiscal 2015, we are currently focused on developing and commercializing our PowerBuoy products and services for use in autonomous power applications. Generally, these applications are independent of the power grid and are located in remote offshore locations. We have incorporated our prior knowledge and best practices into our product design and validation processes, some of which were gained during the development of utility scale buoys. Based on market research and available public data, we believe considerable business opportunity could exist in markets which require autonomous offshore power. 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is to commercialize our autonomous PowerBuoy systems. In order to achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business objectives: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Sell and/or Lease PowerBuoys. We believe the PowerBuoy addresses power requirements in remote offshore applications and locations. Since we believe our autonomous PowerBuoy is well suited for many of these applications, we do not expect the need for continued subsidies or other price incentives for longer-term market adoption. Our fundamental long-term business plan for our selected markets is to sell and lease PowerBuoys, and provide services associated with product sales and leases such as maintenance, application engineering, planning, training, and logistics support required for the PowerBuoy life-cycle. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Concentrate sales and marketing efforts in specific geographic markets. We are currently focusing our sales and marketing efforts in North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia, including Japan. We believe that each of these areas represents a potential market for our autonomous PowerBuoys given appropriate wave conditions, political and economic stability, the existence of selected market applications, and high levels of industrialization and economic development. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Expand our relationships in key market areas. We believe that an important element of our business strategy is to collaborate with other organizations to leverage our combined expertise, market presence and access, and core competences across key markets. We have formed such a relationship with MES in Japan, and we continue to seek other opportunities to collaborate with application experts from within our selected markets. We continue to engage market stakeholders who we believe may be critical to gaining market entry and speeding adoption of our products and services during our commercialization process. We cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our commercialization efforts. We continue to receive stakeholder interest in participating in future in-ocean trials to ensure that relevant application objectives are met. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Outsource most of the equipment fabrication and deployment. We outsource all fabrication, anchoring, mooring, cabling supply, and, in most cases, deployment, of our PowerBuoy in order to minimize our capital requirements as we scale our business. However, our PTO is a proprietary subsystem and is assembled and tested at our facility. The buoy hull of our PowerBuoy may be shipped to our facility for integration of the PTO, or integration may occur closer to the expected deployment site. We believe this distributed manufacturing and assembly approach enables us to focus on our value-adding core competencies while also enabling the cost effectiveness of our PowerBuoy through the leverage of a larger more qualified supply base. We believe the use of suppliers that are in close proximity to our potential customers will reduce shipping costs and risk, and will provide direct visibility to our potential customers, which may improve our credibility and competitiveness. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Continue to increase PowerBuoy output. Our product development and engineering efforts are focused on increasing the energy output, reliability, and expected operating life of our PowerBuoys, as well as optimizing manufacturability of our designs with a focus on cost competitiveness. We believe that by increasing the energy output we will be able to address larger segments of our target markets. By improving our design and manufacturing, we intend to simultaneously remove cost from our PowerBuoys through further design iterations and manufacturing ramp-up. In so doing, we expect to be able to improve customer value, displace more incumbent solutions, and become a viable power source for additional applications in our target market segments. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Maximize customer funding of technology development. We actively seek to obtain external funding for the continued development of our technology, including cost-sharing obligations, under our customer contracts. In April 2010, we were awarded $1.5 million from the DOE for the development of our utility scale PowerBuoy technology. In fiscal 2011, we were awarded an additional $2.4 million from the DOE and $2.3 million from the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) Government&#8217;s Technology Strategy Board for utility scale technology development. In fiscal 2014, the DOE amended our contract to provide funding for the development of an optimized PTO system, and our work under this contract was successfully completed in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

We are targeting our sales and marketing efforts in the following six markets, which we believe present market opportunities for our Company as we seek to commercialize our products and services. 

&#160; 

Oil and Gas 

&#160; 

We believe the oil and gas industry is undergoing a significant transformation. In light of industry consolidation due to relatively low oil prices, the industry continues to invest in new technologies which enable cost savings as well as the digitization of operations. We believe that minor improvements in oil field management can equate to significant additional revenues or cost savings for the operator and is driving the industry to search for new and enabling technologies. We believe that the addition of increased offshore power sources could enable activities like powering seafloor processes and/or augmenting associated power systems. We also believe that cost savings, potential increased revenues, and risk management are key drivers for the oil and gas industry. We also believe that applications such as charging stations for autonomous underwater vehicles, equipment monitoring, communications, reservoir management, weather forecasting, ocean current predictions, and seismic mapping are all significant customer market opportunities for our products. 

&#160; 

Ocean Observing 

&#160; 

Ocean observing provides information for the entire ocean enterprise, consisting of for-profit and not-for-profit businesses which support ocean measurement, observation and forecasting, and is an important provider of information to maritime commerce and the entire &#8220;blue economy.&#8221; Maritime commerce and the scientific community depend on information about areas such as weather, climate change, ocean seismometry and biological processes in order to inform operations and development. The instruments used to collect maritime data and environmental intelligence require a power and communications solution in remote offshore locations. We believe that our PowerBuoy may provide savings over the project life-cycle of incumbent solutions, and the increased power provided by the PowerBuoy may allow for additional sensors and enhanced data communications and/or may enable brand new and critical sensing missions that may have been prohibited due to the lack of sufficient offshore power as provided by incumbent solutions. 

&#160; 

Security and Defense 

&#160; 

In 2011, we deployed a prototype autonomous PowerBuoy off the coast of New Jersey, which we designed and manufactured for the U.S. Navy for coastal security and maritime surveillance (described more fully below under &#8220;Customers &#8211; Historical Projects &#8211; U.S. Navy&#8221;). Our PowerBuoy provided persistent power to an integrated radar system for nearly three months, and the system successfully extended the U.S. Navy&#8217;s surveillance range by a significant amount. Two years later, we redeployed the system, powering both radar and sonar. We believe there is the potential for the U.S. Navy to seek to incorporate this type of surveillance capability in major ports throughout the U.S. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe that a PowerBuoy can be used to provide power and communications for multiple applications, while appearing the same regardless of the application. This may be an attractive feature for defense and security, as their systems can hide in plain sight. An example of such would be an array of PowerBuoys providing surveillance across an inlet or harbor, with communications back to a remote base which could be used to help protect critical and high-value infrastructure. Forward deployed energy and communications outposts, above and below sea surface, early detection and warning systems, remote sensing stations, high frequency radar and sonar, electro-optical and infrared sensors, network communications systems and unmanned underwater vehicle docking stations are all applications for domestic and international defense departments and defense contractors. 

&#160; 

Other Markets 

&#160; 

We believe that opportunities also exist in markets such as offshore wind, communications, and aquaculture. For example, the addition of nearshore and offshore cellular and WiFi platforms with persistent power could decrease communications costs for the marine and airline industries. Continuous power and data communications for the aquaculture industry could potentially transform location requirements of the industry. 

&#160; 

Offshore wind requires meteorological and environmental data to permit, finance and build wind turbine installations. Currently two methods of data collection are used for offshore wind: (1) meteorological masts, which are a significant cost to install on the ocean floor and can take more than 12 months for permitting and construction; and (2) floating, which uses a Light Detection and Ranging device (&#8220;LiDAR&#8221;) and which is gaining acceptance in the industry. Current power and communications platforms for floating LiDAR exist but may not be adequate for continuous data collection. We believe that our PowerBuoy solution may be able to decrease life cycle costs compared to these incumbent solutions. Global wind farm development market data suggest that hundreds of offshore wind sites are in the initial planning stages or beyond, with more being added each year. 

&#160; 

Product and Technologies 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the development and history of our current PowerBuoy product and our technologies. 

&#160; 

Wave Energy 

&#160; 

The energy contained in ocean waves is a form of renewable energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity. Ocean waves are created when wind moves across the ocean surface. The interaction between the wind and the ocean surface causes energy to be exchanged. At first, small waves occur on the ocean surface. As this process continues, the waves become larger and the distance between the top of the waves becomes longer. Wave size, and the amount of kinetic wave energy, depends on wind speed, the duration the wind blows across the waves and the distance covered. The vertical motion of the waves moves the float component of our PowerBuoy, creating mechanical energy which our proprietary technologies convert into usable electricity. 

&#160; 

We believe that there are the following potential benefits to using wave energy for electricity generation, compared to existing incumbent solutions. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Scalability within a small site area. Due to the dense energy in ocean waves, we believe that multiple PowerBuoys may be aggregated in an array that would occupy a reasonably small area to supply electricity to larger payloads. We believe the aggregation of a larger number of appropriately sized PowerBuoys could offer end users a variety of advantages in availability, reliability and scalability. To date, we have not deployed an array of PowerBuoys to test and validate our hypothesis, and we cannot assure that a PowerBuoy array would generate the energy required to meet the needs of prospective customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Predictability. The generation of power from wave energy can be forecasted several days in advance. Wave energy can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy based on satellite images and meteorological data, even when the wave is hundreds of miles away and days from reaching a PowerBuoy. Therefore, we believe end-users relying on PowerBuoys for power may be able to plan their logistics, payload scheduling and other operational activities based on such data and proactively, although we have not tested this theory. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Constant source of energy. The annual flow of waves at certain specific sites can be relatively constant and defined with relatively high accuracy. Based on our studies and analyses of various sites of interest, we believe that, at some point in the future, we will be able to deploy our PowerBuoys in locations where the waves could produce usable electricity for the majority of all hours during a year. 

&#160; 

Methods for generating electricity from wave energy can be divided into two general categories: onshore systems and offshore systems. Our PowerBuoys are the offshore type. Many offshore systems, including our PowerBuoy, utilize a floatation device to harness wave energy. The heaving or pitching of the floatation device due to the force of the waves creates mechanical energy, which is converted into electricity by various technologies. Onshore and near shore systems are often located on a shore cliff or a breakwater, or a short distance at sea from the shore line, and typically must concentrate the wave energy before using it to drive an electrical generator. Although maintenance costs of onshore systems may be less than those associated with offshore systems, we believe there are a variety of disadvantages to the former. As waves approach the shore, their energy decreases, therefore, onshore and near shore wave power stations are not capable of exploiting the same amount of energy produced by waves in deeper water. In addition, suitable sites for onshore and near shore systems are limited and potential environmental and aesthetic issues may impede development of these systems due to wave power station size and proximity of communities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our principal product is our autonomous PowerBuoy, which is designed to generate power for use independent of the power grid in remote offshore locations. It consists of a main hull structure surrounded by a floating buoy-like device. The hull is loosely moored to the seabed so that floating buoy can freely move up and down in response to the rising and falling of the waves. The PTO device that includes an electrical generator, a power electronics system, our control system, and our ESS are sealed within the hull. As ocean waves pass the PowerBuoy, the mechanical stroke action created by the waves is converted into rotational mechanical energy by the PTO, which in turn, drives the electrical generator. The power electronics system then conditions the electrical output which is collected within an ESS. The operation of the PowerBuoy is controlled by our customized, proprietary control system. 

&#160; 

The control system uses sensors and an onboard computer to continuously monitor the PowerBuoy subsystems as well as the characteristics of the waves which interact with the PowerBuoy. The control system collects data from the sensors and the payloads, and uses proprietary algorithms to electronically adjust the performance of the PowerBuoy. We believe that this ability to optimize and manage the electric power output of the PowerBuoy is a significant advantage of our technology. 

&#160; 

In the event of large storm waves, the control system automatically locks the PowerBuoy and electricity generation is suspended. However, the load center (either the on-board payload or that in the vicinity of the PowerBuoy) may continue to receive power from the on-board ESS. When wave heights return to normal operating conditions, the control system automatically unlocks the PowerBuoy and electricity generation and ESS replenishment recommence. This safety feature helps to prevent the PowerBuoy from being damaged by storm wave impacts. 

&#160; 

In March 2016, we announced a rebranding of our PowerBuoy systems as part of our commercialization efforts and to closely align our PowerBuoy products with the perceived best practices of analogous industries based on power generation and on-board energy storage capabilities. Under our new naming conventions, our current PowerBuoy is referred to as the &#8220;PB3,&#8221; corresponding to &#8220;PowerBuoy with a peak power rating of three kilowatts.&#8221; This naming convention is based upon the ideal yet achievable ocean conditions that would result in a net AC peak power delivered by the PB3 PowerBuoy to a payload over a 20 minute period after converting the incoming wave energy into useful AC electricity. References on our website, and in our SEC filings and this Annual Report to the &#8220;APB350&#8221; refers to earlier prototype PowerBuoys containing earlier generation PTOs and other earlier technologies. 

&#160; 

The PB3 has undergone a design iteration from our immediate prior design focusing on improving its reliability and survivability in the anticipated operating ocean environment, and will continue to undergo further enhancements through customary product life cycle management. The PB3-A1 was an initial prototype that has now undergone in-ocean and accelerated life testing, and we believe that the PB3 will achieve a maturity level for use by early adopters in fiscal 2017, but we are in the early stages of seeking to commercialize our product and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to do so. We believe that the PB3 will generate and store sufficient power to address some application requirements in our target markets. Our product development and engineering efforts are focused, in part, on increasing the energy output and efficiency of our PowerBuoys and, if we are able to do so, we believe the PowerBuoy would be useful for additional applications where cost savings and additional power are required by our potential customers. We have only begun to explore opportunities in these target markets, and we have not yet developed any integrated solutions and product offerings in these potential markets. We believe that by increasing the energy output of our PowerBuoys we may be able to address larger segments of our target markets. By improving our design and manufacturing, we also seek to reduce the cost of our PowerBuoys through further design iterations and manufacturing ramp-up. In so doing, we seek to improve customer value, displace more incumbent solutions, and become a viable power source for additional applications in our target market segments. 

&#160; 

R esearch and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development team has a broad range of experience in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, hydrodynamics and systems engineering. We have engaged in extensive research and development efforts to develop the PowerBuoy, improve PowerBuoy efficiency, reliability and power output, and to improve manufacturability while reducing cost and complexity. Our research and development efforts have been focused recently on optimizing the size of our PowerBuoys in order to achieve the most competitive overall cost (both operating and capital expenditures) in our target markets. Such efforts included in recent years reducing overall product size and weight by considering the use of materials other than steel for the external structure of our PowerBuoys. Other recent efforts included the development of scalable, higher efficiency, lower cost, higher reliability and less customized PTO systems, and the use of higher energy density and lower weight energy storage technologies. We continue to seek to increase the capabilities of our PowerBuoy systems by designing flexible interfaces and rendering them sensor and payload agnostic. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Other areas of research and development focus have included the development and implementation of accelerated testing regimens and techniques known as accelerated life testing. Such methods accelerate failures in a laboratory environment, as compared to more lengthy and expensive full scale ocean deployments during normal use conditions. This testing allows us to quantify the life characteristics of critical components and subsystems which would normally require several years of operation in ocean conditions to achieve similar levels of wear and tear. Accelerated life testing is used successfully in other industries such as automotive and aerospace, and is a critical enabler for rapid product and technology development and maturation. We believe that the combination of laboratory and ocean test regimens coupled with carefully planned PowerBuoy ocean tests will help us to improve our effectiveness in commercializing our products. 

&#160; 

It is our intent to fund the majority of our research and development expenses over the next several years with sources of external funding, including cost sharing obligations under customer contracts. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to secure additional contracts. If we are unable to obtain external funding, we may curtail our research and development expenses or reduce the scope of our operations as necessary to lower our operating costs. 

&#160; 

Deployments 

&#160; 

We continue to receive important feedback from in-ocean deployments of our PowerBuoys, as is customary in the marine industry for new vessels and products prior to final acceptance by their customers. If we are able to increase PowerBuoy production, we anticipate that the need for in-ocean trials of our mature products will diminish. Deployment sites are selected based on minimum ocean depth, appropriate wave activity for power generation requirements of associated deployment payloads, and proximity to end-user operations. The PB3 can be transported over land to the deployment port using a standard 40 foot &#8220;low-boy&#8221; trailer. Once at port, the PB3 can be lifted into the water or onboard a vessel using a readily available crane of appropriate capacity. The PB3 may then be towed to site using a standard vessel (if the location is within an appropriate distance from the port), or the PB3 may be carried aboard a vessel to its offshore location, and craned into the water at site. The PB3 is then attached to the mooring system, which is installed during a separate operation, after which a brief commissioning process places the PB3 into operation. Recent deployments include the PB3-A1 in August and October of 2015, and again in June 2016. In July 2016, we deployed our first commercial PB3 PowerBuoy, approximately four miles off of the coast of New Jersey. The Company currently anticipates that this deployment will be the final validation of the PB3 prior to the anticipated March 2017 six-month lease of the PB3 PowerBuoy under a previously announced customer agreement. 

&#160; 

Product Insurance. We currently have a property loss and liability insurance policy underwritten by Lloyd&#39;s Underwriters that covers the deployment and storage of our PowerBuoys. 

&#160; 

Site Approval. In the U.S., federal agencies regulate the siting of long-term renewable energy projects and related-uses located on the outer continental shelf (&#8220;OCS&#8221;), which is generally more than three miles offshore. OCS projects longer than one-year in duration are regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (&#8220;BOEM&#8221;). For projects located within three miles of the U.S. shore regardless of duration, the adjacent state would be responsible for issuing a lease and other required authorizations for the location of the project. In either case, an assessment of the potential environmental impact of the project would be conducted in addition to other requirements. Generally, the same process applies to foreign sites where site approval is contingent on meeting both national and local regulatory and environmental requirements. In connection with issuing permits or leases enabling project use, the respective government agency often requires site restoration or other activities at the conclusion of the permit or lease period. 

&#160; 

Environmental Approval and Compliance. We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, in the U.S., the construction and operation of PowerBuoys offshore would require permits and approvals from the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other governmental authorities. These required permits and approvals evaluate, among other things, whether a project is in the public interest and ensure that the project would not create a hazard to navigation. Other foreign and international laws may require similar approvals. We provide you with additional information under &#8220;Regulation&#8221; below.

We currently have one revenue producing contract, which is our agreement with MES. The MES agreement is a $975,587 contract for engineering services and a six-month lease of our PB3 PowerBuoy off the coast of Japan. The lease portion of this contract is currently expected to commence in March 2017 and run through August 2017. MES has the right to cancel all or any separable part of the MES contract for convenience upon 30 days written notice to us, and the contract contains other customary terms and conditions. 

&#160; 

In order to be successful, we must expand our customer base and obtain commercial contracts for us to lease or sell our PowerBuoy and related services to customers. Our potential customer base for our PowerBuoys includes various public and private entities, and agencies that require autonomous offshore power. To date, substantially all of our revenue producing contracts have been with a small number of customers under contracts to fund a portion of the costs of our operational efforts to develop and improve our technology, validate our product through ocean and laboratory testing, and business development activities with potential commercial customers. Most of our revenues to date have been cost-reimbursement contracts with customers funding our product development efforts. Our goal in the future is that an increased portion of our revenues will be from the lease or sale of our products and related maintenance and other services. Our significant customers and contracts to date are summarized below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We have worked with MES (2010 to current) to develop several PowerBuoy projects in Japan. Historically, our agreements with MES have provided for MES to reimburse us for specific costs associated with research, development and deployment of our PowerBuoy product. In March 2016, we entered into a letter of intent (&#8220;LOI&#8221;) with MES to conduct funded pre-work tasks and to negotiate a definitive agreement that would allow for the lease of the PB3 PowerBuoy for a project off the coast of Kozushima Island, Japan following a planned stage gate review. Stage-gate reviews are used in product development to gather key information needed to advance the project to the next gate or decision point. This process is a generally accepted industry practice and has been utilized by other customers such as the DOE. 

&#160; 

In June 2016, as described above, we announced a definitive agreement with MES for engineering and other services and a six-month lease of our PB3 PowerBuoy, which is anticipated to commence in March 2017, and currently expected to extend through August 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We have worked with the DOE (2008 to current) and the U.K. government&#8217;s Technology Strategy Board (2010 to 2014) under contracts to help fund technology improvements to increase the power output of our prototype PowerBuoys. Two DOE contracts concluded in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Strategic Relation ships 

&#160; 

We also have developed some strategic relationships with companies seeking to validate our PowerBuoy as a source of energy for specific applications. These strategic relationships generally require us to provide services and/or products to, or in conjunction with, our strategic partners, seeking to jointly develop an application. We generally bear our own costs associated with the performance of these strategic arrangements and these relationships generally do not generate any revenues for us. Our current strategic relationships are described below. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In 2015, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with Gardline Environmental to jointly develop and market innovative metocean monitoring and maritime security systems for prospective customers in the oil and gas, ocean observing, and security and defense markets. We are currently working with Gardline Environmental to finalize phase one of the MOU in order to advance to the next phase. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In 2016, we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (&#8220;CRADA&#8221;) with the National Data Buoy Center (&#8220;NBDC&#8221;) to conduct ocean demonstrations of its innovative Self-Contained Ocean Observing Payload (&#8220;SCOOP&#8221;) monitoring system integrated into our PB3-A1 PowerBuoy. NDBC operates a large network of buoys and stations which provide critical meteorological and oceanic observations that are utilized by government, industry, and academia throughout the world. Under the CRADA, an initial ocean demonstration will be conducted off the coast of New Jersey. Site-specific measurements of meteorological and ocean conditions, as well as system performance and maintenance data collection, will be carried out. We have integrated the SCOOP onto our PB3 PowerBuoy and in June 2016 we deployed the system off of the coast of New Jersey. The SCOOP is powered by the PB3, and is providing metocean data to us and to NDBC. We expect this deployment to continue for approximately three months before retrieval of the PB3-A1. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In May 2016, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (&#8220;MOA&#8221;) with the Wildlife Conservation Society (&#8220;WCS&#8221;) to explore the use of our PowerBuoys in conjunction with ocean life monitoring sensors to collect ocean mammal migration data. The MOA includes the exploration and assessment of the use of the PB3 as an integration platform to provide power and communications to sensors that monitor marine life migrations. An initial effort consisting of a battery powered sensor mounted to the PB3-A1 is deployed off of the coast of New Jersey and will seek to establish a baseline acoustic survey. We expect this integration and deployment to continue for approximately three months before retrieval of the PB3-A1.

Historic Projects 

&#160; 

Our relationships and projects during recent years include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The U . S . Navy and Department of Homeland Security. 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

From 2009 to 2011, we ocean-tested our utility-scale PowerBuoy at the U.S. Marine Corps Base, Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay. The PowerBuoy was launched under our program with the U.S. Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of a prior iteration of our PowerBuoy, including connection to the Oahu power grid. 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

From 2007 to 2013, we worked on two separate contracts to fabricate and deploy two autonomous PowerBuoys, which were subsequently deemed obsolete, as an alternate power source for the U.S. Navy&#39;s Deep Water Active Detection System (&#8220;DWADS&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

In 2009 and 2010, we were awarded $2.4 million and $2.75 million, respectively, from the U.S. Navy to develop a Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (&#8220;LEAP&#8221;) prototype. The LEAP contract was developed to enhance the U.S. Navy&#39;s territorial protection capability by providing potential persistent power at sea for port maritime surveillance in the near coast, harbor, piers and offshore areas. During the LEAP contract, we designed, built and deployed in 2011 a PowerBuoy structure incorporating a new PTO system. The system was deployed by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel and was ocean-tested approximately 20 miles off of the coast of New Jersey. It was integrated with a Rutgers University-operated land-based radar network that provided ocean current mapping data for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (&#8220;NOAA&#8221;) and U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue (&#8220;SAR&#8221;) operations. The ocean test of the LEAP vessel detection system demonstrated dual-use capability of the radar network and helped to verify our technology as a potential persistent power source for systems requiring remote power at sea. During the ocean testing under these contracts, our PowerBuoy withstood the high storm waves of Hurricane Irene. 

&#160; 

&#160; o 

In 2012, we executed a CRADA with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to collaborate and demonstrate persistent maritime vessel detection. The vessel detection ocean demonstration in 2013 utilized the same PowerBuoy under the LEAP contract with additional sensors. This additional deployment provided critical data which informed our next design iteration, and which incorporated major modifications to address critical operations and reliability improvements. This project concluded in 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Lockheed Martin . From 2004 to 2014, we had several project teaming agreements and license agreements with Lockheed Martin. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Australia. In 2008, we announced a Joint Development Agreement with Leighton Contractors Pty. Ltd. (&#8220;Leighton&#8221;) for the development of wave power projects off the coast of Australia. In 2009, Leighton formed Victorian Wave Partners Pty Ltd (&#8220;VWP&#8221;), a special purpose company for the development of a wave power project off the coast of Victoria, Australia. In 2010, VWP and the Commonwealth of Australia entered into an Energy Demonstration Program Funding Deed (&#8220;Funding Deed&#8221;), wherein VWP was awarded an A$66.5 million (approximately US$62 million) grant for the wave power project. However, receipt of funds under the grant was subject to certain terms, including achievement of future significant external funding milestones. The grant was expected to be used towards the A$232 million proposed cost of building and deploying a wave power station off the coast of Australia (the &#8220;Project&#8221;). In March 2012, our Australian subsidiary Ocean Power Technologies (Australasia) Pty. Ltd acquired 100% ownership of VWP from Leighton. In January 2014, VWP signed a Deed of Variation with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (&#8220;ARENA&#8221;) that amended the Funding Deed, and, in March 2014, received the initial portion of the grant from ARENA in the amount of approximately A$5.6 million (approximately US$5.2 million) (the &#8220;Initial Funding&#8221;). The Initial Funding was subject to claw-back provisions if certain contractual requirements, including performance criteria, were not satisfied. In light of the claw-back provisions, we determined to classify the Initial Funding as an advance payment, hold the funds as restricted cash and defer recognition of the funds as revenue. In July 2014, the VWP Board of Directors determined that the project contemplated by the Funding Deed was no longer commercially viable and terminated the Funding Deed. The Initial Funding was returned to ARENA. We do not currently have any projects in Australia. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Japan. In fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, we worked with MES under several contracts to enhance our PowerBuoy technology for Japanese sea conditions for both utility scale and autonomous applications. Under these contracts and leveraging prior work with MES, we analyzed methods to maximize buoy power capture, performed modeling and wave tank testing, evaluated novel mooring strategies and conducted design reviews. Currently, the utility scale effort with MES has been suspended and our current efforts with MES are focused on autonomous applications. We billed and were paid for all eligible costs incurred under the previous utility scale project with MES in fiscal 2015. Our revenue recorded in fiscal 2015 reflects the total amount paid on these MES contracts. See above under &#8220;&#8212;Current Customers&#8221; for a description of our current contract with MES. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Reedsport, Oregon Project. We obtained a permit in 2007 from the Federal Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) for a multi-stage wave power project off the coast of Reedsport, Oregon. In addition, we received two cost-sharing contracts with the DOE for approximately $4.4 million to construct and deploy a single PowerBuoy off the coast of Reedsport. We subsequently obtained a license from FERC in August 2012 that authorized installation and operation of a 10-buoy grid connected wave energy array (the &#8220;License&#8221;). Due to the complexity of the FERC regulations for the single buoy, higher than anticipated project costs, unanticipated technical risks, and uncertainty surrounding permitting, we made the decision not to proceed with the project. Accordingly, we announced in March 2014 our surrender of the permit for one phase of the project and announced in April 2014 that we were taking the steps necessary to close out this project with the DOE. In May 2014, we filed an application to surrender the FERC permit for the remaining phases. In August 2014, in cooperation with the State of Oregon Department of State Lands, we removed anchoring and mooring equipment from the seabed off of the coast of Oregon and are taking steps to dispose of or repurpose equipment acquired for the project. In fiscal 2016, we dispositioned the PowerBuoy. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The EU WavePort Project . In 2010, we were awarded &#8364;2.2 million under the European Commission&#39;s Seventh Framework Programme (&#8220;FP7&#8221;) by the European Commission&#39;s Directorate (&#8220;EC&#8221;) responsible for new and renewable sources of energy, energy efficiency and innovation. This grant was part of a total award of &#8364;4.5 million to a consortium of companies, including us, to deliver a PowerBuoy wave energy device, referred to as the PB40 (a legacy utility scale buoy), under a project entitled WavePort. We commenced work under this grant in fiscal 2012, and this cost-sharing contract expired on July 31, 2014. Due to a variety of factors, in October 2014, we shipped the PB40 back to New Jersey in order to undertake to deploy it off of the coast of New Jersey using our own funding. The legacy utility scale buoy was deployed in July 2015 and retrieved in August 2015, due to failure of a component part. We do not intend to redeploy the PB40. Following a project audit, final payment under the WavePort Project was received and recognized as revenue in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

PowerBuoy Development Projects . In April 2010, we received a $1.5 million award from the DOE for a feasibility study of a PowerBuoy with the ability to produce up to 500kW of power (referred to as the &#8220;PB500&#8221;). In fiscal 2011, we received additional awards totaling $4.7 million for the PB500 structure and PTO optimization study, $2.3 million from the U.K. Government&#8217;s Technology Strategy Board and $2.4 million from the DOE. In fiscal 2014, upon completion of the concept design and associated trade studies that included detailed mechanical analyses, manufacturability and overall projected performance, the study concluded that a PB500 would not be technically feasible or economically viable. Our development efforts since that time have focused on further optimization of our modular and optimized PTO technology. In March 2015, we successfully completed a stage gate review and a review of project deliverables with the DOE where advancements related to PTO design aspects such as reliability, cost take out, manufacturability and scalability were reviewed. Following a stage gate review, the project was successfully completed in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We engage in two types of manufacturing activities: 1) the manufacturing of the high value-added PTO components for systems control, power generation and conversion, and energy storage for each PowerBuoy; and 2) contracting with outside companies for the fabrication of the buoy structure, anchoring, mooring, and cabling. 

&#160; 

Our core in-house manufacturing activity is the assembly, final systems integration and testing of the PTO and its components, which is conducted at our Pennington, New Jersey facility. The power generation system consists of electro-mechanical components, and the control modules include the critical electrical and electronic systems that convert the mechanical energy into usable electricity. The sensors and control systems use sophisticated technology to optimize the performance of the PowerBuoy in response to changing operating conditions and payload power demand. We maintain a portfolio of patents, including those that cover our power generation, power conversion and control technologies. 

&#160; 

We purchase the remaining components and materials for each PowerBuoy from various vendors. We provide specifications to each vendor, and they are responsible for performing quality analysis and quality control over the course of construction, subject to our review of the quality and test procedure results. After the vendor completes the testing of the buoy structure, it is transported to our facility for final integration of the PTO. After each vendor completes testing of the remaining components, they are transported ready-to-install to the project site. We do not believe that we are dependent on any single vendor for manufacturing the components of and materials for our PowerBuoy, and we believe that there are many available manufacturers for our component parts if a particular manufacturing partner should become unavailable or expensive. However, we have only manufactured our PowerBuoys in limited quantities for use in development and testing and have limited commercial manufacturing experience, and our work with our vendors has not included work on multiple orders on time-critical deadlines. Moreover, we do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers or vendors. In order to be successful in our efforts to commercialize our PowerBuoys, we will need to secure stable relationships with a variety of manufacturers and vendors that can supply component parts and materials for our PowerBuoy products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

We are enhancing our marketing capabilities and have begun marketing our autonomous PowerBuoys. We currently use a direct sales force consisting of employees and consultants. Because our autonomous PowerBuoys use technology which is not yet considered mature by our target markets, we expect that the customer decision process could require us to spend substantial time educating end-users and stakeholders, which may result in a lengthy sales cycle for our PowerBuoys. 

&#160; 

We market our PowerBuoys to companies and entities requiring remote power applications; for example, oil and gas companies for potential applications such as remote sensing, trace heating, or autonomous underwater vehicle charging stations. We also see opportunities for security and defense applications using active sensors such as high frequency radar and acoustic systems with significant processing and communications requirements. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we continue to seek to enter into strategic relationships to develop application solutions with commercial and military sensor and equipment manufacturers, where we might grant licenses to manufacture, market or operate PowerBuoys or PowerBuoy subsystems. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

As of April 30, 2016, our backlog was negligible. As of April 30, 2015, our prior negotiated backlog was $0.9 million. In 2016, a utility project with MES was suspended and is excluded from backlog because we do not expect work under that contract to continue as we shift focus to the new autonomous PowerBuoy project with MES. Subsequently, on May 31, 2016, we entered into a contract with MES totaling $975,587, a portion of which was performed in fiscal 2016 as agreed under a LOI signed in March 2016. Our backlog at April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015 included cost-sharing contracts as described in the Financial Operations Overview section of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis in this Annual Report. Our backlog can include both funded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer (U.S. Congress, in the case of U.S. Government agencies), and unfunded amounts, which are unfilled firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. If any of our contracts were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining terms of such contract. Our backlog was fully funded at April 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

The amount of contract backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue because modifications to or terminations of present contracts and production delays can provide additional revenue or reduce anticipated revenue. A substantial portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, and changes in estimates from time to time may have a significant effect on revenue and backlog. Our backlog is also typically subject to large variations from time to time due to the timing of new awards . 

&#160; 

For fiscal 2016, we generated revenues of $0.7 million and incurred a net loss attributable to Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. of $13.1 million, and for fiscal 2015, we generated revenues of $4.1 million and incurred a net loss attributable to Ocean Power Technologies, Inc. of $13.1 million. As of April 30, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $177.9 million. We have not been profitable since inception, and we do not know whether or when we will become profitable because of the significant uncertainties with respect to our ability to successfully commercialize our PowerBuoys. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We expect to compete with other providers of in-ocean autonomous energy sources, including battery, solar and fossil-fuel providers, most of which are substantially larger than OPT and have access to greater financial resources. Incumbent sources of in-ocean energy also represent established and reliable sources of energy and already have gained customer acceptance. Our ability to compete and compete successfully for business from applications seeking in-ocean energy will depend on our ability to produce and store energy reliably in-ocean and at a total cost that is competitive with or lower than that of other providers. In addition, our ability to compete successfully will depend on the reliability of our product and our potential customers&#8217; perceived impressions regarding our company. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected by our current need for additional financing and our potential customers&#8217; concerns about our long-term viability. 

&#160; 

We also may compete against other renewable wave generated energy providers. As of April 2016, there were more than 250 companies, some with institutional funding, listed in the DOE&#8217;s Marine and Hydrokinetic (&#8220;MHK&#8221;) Technology Database. This DOE database provides up-to-date information on marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies and companies, both in the U.S. and around the world. Many of these companies are located in the U.K., continental Europe, Japan, Israel, the U.S. and Australia, and many of those companies are pursuing the utility, grid-connected energy market. The MHK industry is both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to differentiate themselves by promoting their specific technology focusing on cost and efficiency. The companies are subdivided by implementation: wave power, current power, tidal and ocean thermal energy conversion. Within wave power, the technologies are classified as point absorber, oscillating wave column, overtopping device, attenuator and oscillating wave surge converter. Our PowerBuoy wave energy converter is classified as a point absorber. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The vast majority of the companies in the DOE&#8217;s database are small, start-up type companies with a small number of employees and in early stage development who do not have our in-ocean validation experience. Only a few of these companies have conducted accelerated life testing and have also conducted extensive wave tank testing on reduced scale models of their devices. We believe our in-ocean experience is critical in proving the reliability, survivability and performance of any wave energy system, which we believe our potential customers will require before adopting any wave generated energy solution. We believe our experience gained through full scale in-ocean deployments, coupled with other types of testing, and our resulting understanding of risks and failure modes may provide us with an advantage compared to other wave energy potential competitors. 

&#160; 

OPT&#39;s analysis of the DOE database indicates that approximately twenty wave energy technologies were selected for further evaluation primarily based on company financial capability, type of system and potential to compete in autonomous (non-grid connected) markets. Of these, there are three companies that we believe may have the technical capability and financial viability to compete in the autonomous market; however, their technologies are still in early stage development with limited ocean testing. We believe that none of these technologies are at the maturity level of our current PB3 PowerBuoy, and because of this we may have a first mover advantage as compared with these wave energy providers. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe that our technology differentiates us from other providers of wave technologies. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation and may rely on licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

&#160; 

As of April 2016, we have been issued 62 U.S. patents, of which 48 are active and 14 have expired. We have filed for two additional U.S. patents. A total of 22 of the active U.S. patents have been issued foreign patent protection. An additional four active patents have been filed for foreign patent protection. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims directed to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

system design; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

control systems; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

power conversion; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

anchoring and mooring; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

wave farm architecture. 

&#160; 

The expiration dates for our issued U.S. patents range from 2018 to 2032. We do not consider any single patent or patent application that we hold to be material to our business. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in continuing to obtain effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. In addition, certain technologies that we developed with U.S. federal government funding are subject to certain government rights as described in "Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Intellectual Property ." 

&#160; 

We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products. We have registered our PowerBuoy &#174; , PBView &#174; , Talk on Water &#174; , CellBuoy &#174; and PowerTower &#174; marks and our Making Waves in Power &#174; service mark in the United States.

Regulation 

&#160; 

Our PowerBuoys are subject to regulation in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning, among other areas, site approval and environmental approval and compliance. In order to encourage the adoption of offshore power solutions, many governments offer subsidies and other financial incentives and have mandated renewable energy targets which some of our customers may be able to leverage. However, these subsidies, incentives and targets may not be applicable to our technology and therefore may not be available to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The renewable energy industry has also been subject to increasing regulation. As the renewable energy industry continues to evolve and as the wave energy industry continues to evolve, we anticipate that wave energy technology and our PowerBuoys and their deployment will be subject to increased oversight and regulation in accordance with international, national and local regulations relating to safety, sites, and environmental protection.

Site Approval , Environmental Approval and Compliance 

&#160; 

We present additional information regarding the regulatory requirements relating to our in-ocean deployments above, under &#8220;Product and Technologies &#8211; Deployments.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Subsidies and Incentives 

&#160; 

Renewable energy subsidies and incentives are generally applicable only to electric generation and supply to the utility grid. However, our autonomous applications may permit a customer to reduce its carbon emissions, which our potential customers may be able to publicize in their environmental stewardship reports. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of April 30, 2016, we had 29 full-time employees and one part-time employee. Of these employees, 28 are located in Pennington, New Jersey and one is located in the U.K. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good.
