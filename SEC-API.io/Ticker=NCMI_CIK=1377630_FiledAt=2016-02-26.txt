Description of Business

Overview

NCM LLC operates the largest digital in-theatre media network in North America, through which it sells in-theatre and online advertising and promotions. Our advertising and entertainment pre-show called &#8220; FirstLook &#8221;, lobby entertainment network (&#8220;LEN&#8221;) and programming are distributed across our digital content network (&#8220;DCN&#8221;) utilizing our proprietary digital content software (&#8220;DCS&#8221;).

We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses within several versions of FirstLook , which we distribute to theatre screens in our digital network. We also sell advertising programming on our LEN and other forms of advertising and promotions in theatre lobbies and online through our Cinema Accelerator product and on mobile devices through an app called Movie Night Out &#174; .

We believe that the reach, digital delivery and projection capabilities of our network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach a large, young and affluent audience on a targeted, engaging and measurable basis. During 2015, over 700 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which NCM LLC currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place. A summary of the screens in our advertising network is set forth in the table below:

100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors), and approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is generated by theatres connected to our DCN, with the remainder delivered on USB drives. 

On-Screen Advertising 

Our on-screen digital FirstLook pre-feature show consists of national, regional and local advertising, as well as behind the scenes &#8220;making-of&#8221; and other entertainment content provided to us under exclusive multi-year arrangements with leading media, entertainment and technology companies (&#8220;content partners&#8221;) and other clients. The pre-feature show generally ranges in length from 20 to 30 minutes and ends at or about the advertised show time. We distribute several versions of FirstLook each month, including versions that include promotional materials for our theatre partners, entertainment content and national and regional advertisements that are targeted towards movie ratings, specific films, or groups of films related to specific film genres and local and regional advertisements that play in specific theatre markets or geographic regions. The FirstLook pre-shows are customized with the branding of certain of the theatre circuits in which the programming plays. We have the capability to deliver three-dimensional (&#8220;3-D&#8221;) advertising campaigns within a 3-D version of the FirstLook program prior to 3-D films.

The majority of our entertainment content segments are provided to us by content partners. Under the terms of the contracts, our content partners make available to us original content segments and make commitments (generally for terms of two years) to buy a portion of our advertising inventory at a specified cost per thousand (&#8220;CPM&#8221;). The original content produced by these content partners typically features behind-the-scenes interviews about the &#8220;making-of&#8221; feature films, upcoming broadcasts, cable television shows, or technology products. We also have two-year agreements to exhibit a courtesy public service announcement (&#8220;PSA&#8221;) with an insurance company and a candy company which expire at the end of 2017. We also have a long-term agreement to display advertising of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; beverage supplier.

Advertising is sold on a CPM basis to national clients, while local and regional advertising is sold on a per-screen, per-week basis, and to a lesser extent on a CPM basis. We generally sell our national advertising units across our national network by film rating, groups of ratings or by individual film or film genre grouping. This ability to target various groups of films offers national advertisers a way to target specific audience demographics at various price points and overall cost levels, which expands the number of potential clients.

FirstLook was created in order to provide a more entertaining pre-feature program for theatre patrons and a more targeted and effective advertising platform for our advertising clients by integrating national, regional and local video advertising with entertainment content segments primarily provided by our content partners. 

FirstLook is comprised of up to four segments, each approximately four to seven minutes in length. Segment four, the first section of FirstLook , begins approximately 20 to 25 minutes prior to the advertised show time and generally includes local advertising. Segment three typically begins approximately 18 minutes prior to the advertised show time and features primarily 15 or 30-second local or regional advertisements by individual theatres, or across an entire DMA &#174; or geographic region. Segment two and segment one that run closest to the advertised show time feature primarily national and regional advertisements, which are generally 30 or 60 seconds. Segment one also includes an advertisement for NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; beverage supplier. Segment two and segment one begin approximately 13 minutes and 8 minutes, respectively, before the advertised show time. Segment three, segment two and segment one include an entertainment content segment provided primarily by our content partners. Beginning in 2015, approximately half of our content partners provided two minute entertainment content segments, while the remainder provided two and one-half minute segments. In 2016, all of our content partners will provide two minute segments. 

We sell 3-D advertising that runs prior to select 3-D films. The 3-D advertisements are placed at the end of the FirstLook pre-show, after a message for patrons to put on 3-D glasses. These 3-D advertisements provide average advertising CPMs that are higher than average two-dimensional (&#8220;2-D&#8221;) pricing due primarily to a fewer number of 3-D advertisements and improved recall (based on third-party research) associated with those 3-D advertisements. In order to provide a better experience, theatre patrons are prompted to put their glasses on prior to the 3-D portion of FirstLook so they can be kept on throughout the end of the FirstLook pre-show, during the film trailers and 3-D feature film.

As of December 31, 2015, 100% of our network screens were displaying the FirstLook pre-show on digital projectors, with approximately 97% of those screens receiving content through our DCN, representing approximately 98% of our total network attendance. As of December 31, 2015, 18,223, or 90%, of 20,361 total digital screens are equipped with more powerful digital cinema projectors, with the remainder comprised of LCD projectors. The screens not connected to our DCN display national and regional advertisements on digital projectors through the distribution of the advertising content on USB drives that are shipped to the theatres via overnight delivery services.

The film trailers that typically run before the feature film are not part of FirstLook . Film trailers do not begin until after the FirstLook program ends at or about the advertised show time. 

We offer multiple versions of FirstLook each month that include advertising content that is appropriate for a specific film or film rating category and branding of the specific theatre operator. This programming flexibility provides advertisers with the ability to target specific audience demographics and gives us the ability to ensure that the content and advertising is age-appropriate for the movie audience. We rotate the entertainment content segments between theatres approximately every two weeks to ensure that frequent moviegoers are entertained by fresh content segments.

Our goal in creating FirstLook as a branded entertainment program was to create a new &#8220;first release window&#8221; for advertising into the marketplace, similar to the way films are released first in cinemas. To that end, we encourage advertisers to provide us with advertisements before they are shown on other media platforms, different versions of those advertisements, or original content that is specifically created for cinema. All versions of the FirstLook are produced by our internal creative staff, including pre- and post-production services that we offer to our clients (primarily local clients), for a fee. These high quality internal production capabilities provide the timing flexibility and cost efficiency required to produce and display the many versions of our high quality FirstLook pre-show.

The FirstLook program also includes time slots for NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and network affiliates to advertise various activities associated with the operations of the theatres, including concessions, online ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theatre operator and vendors of services provided to theatres, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor&#8217;s service or products sold in the theatre. This time is provided by us to the theatre operator at no charge and generally includes 45 seconds within 15 minutes of show time, 15 seconds of which will be placed within 12 minutes of show time, and the remainder placed at our discretion.

Under the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the FirstLook program can be sold to NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. During the first six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and during the last six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to two of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and 30 seconds to one of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members. Per the ESA, the annual CPM change equals the prior year annual percentage change in the advertising CPM charged by NCM LLC to unaffiliated third parties during the last few minutes of the FirstLook pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC. 

The arrangements with NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members relating to on-screen advertising for their beverage concessionaires, the agreements with our content partners and the PSAs represented approximately $132.5 million, or approximately 30%, of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Lobby Network and Promotions

Lobby Entertainment Network (LEN) . Our LEN is a network of video screens strategically located throughout the lobbies of all of our digitally equipped NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; theatres and the majority of our network affiliate theatres. As of December 31, 2015, our LEN had 3,104 screens in 1,519 theatres connected to our DCN. The LEN screens are strategically placed in high-traffic locations such as concession stands and film queuing and other waiting areas. Programming on our LEN consists of an approximately 30-minute loop of branded entertainment content segments created specifically for the lobby with advertisements running between each segment. We have the scheduling flexibility to send different LEN programming to each theatre and the same program is displayed simultaneously on all lobby screens within a given theatre, which we believe provides the maximum impact for our advertisers. We sell national and local advertising on the LEN individually or bundled with on-screen or other lobby promotions. The LEN programming includes up to two minutes for NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; advertisements to promote activities associated with the operation of the theatres, including concessions, ticketing partners, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by the theatre operator and vendors of services provided to theatres, so long as such promotion is incidental to the vendor&#8217;s service. Additionally, subject to certain limitations, the LEN programming includes up to two minutes (one minute of which we provide to NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members at no cost and one minute of which NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members may purchase) to promote certain non-exclusive cross-marketing relationships entered into by the theatre operators for the purpose of increasing theatre attendance, which we call &#8220;strategic programs&#8221;. 

Under the terms of the ESAs, NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members also have the right to install additional screens in their theatre lobbies, which would not display our LEN programming, but would be used to promote strategic programs or 

products sold in their theat re concessions, bars and dining operations, ticketing partner promotions, gift card and loyalty programs, special events presented by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding member and vendors of services provided to theatres, so long as such promotion is incidental to the ven dor&#8217;s service. 

Lobby Promotions . We also sell a wide variety of advertising and promotional products in our theatre lobbies. These products can be sold individually or bundled with on-screen, LEN, online or mobile advertising. Lobby promotions typically include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

advertising on concession items such as beverage cups, popcorn bags and kids&#8217; trays; 

&#160;

&#183; 

coupons and promotional materials, which are customizable by film and are distributed to ticket buyers at the box office; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product sampling and display; 

&#160;

&#183; 

touch-screen display units and kiosks; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

signage throughout the lobbies, including posters, banners, counter cards, danglers, floor mats, standees and window clings. 

Under the terms of the ESAs, NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members may conduct a limited number of lobby promotions at no charge in connection with strategic programs that promote motion pictures; however, such activities will not reduce the lobby promotions inventory available to us.

Our ability to provide in-lobby marketing and promotional placements in conjunction with our other marketing solutions allows us to provide integrated marketing products to advertisers with multiple interactions with theatre patrons throughout the movie-going experience, which we believe is a competitive advantage over other national media platforms.

Branded Entertainment Websites and Mobile Applications

We have a business website, ncm.com and two consumer facing websites, firstlookonline.com and movienightout.com and a mobile app called Movie Night Out . In May 2014, NCM LLC signed a service agreement with Shazam Media Services, Inc. (&#8220;Shazam&#8221;) to allow movie-goers to explore and engage with the FirstLook pre-show content on their mobile device using the Shazam app. In addition to allowing our advertising clients to engage the theatre audience by connecting their on-screen advertisements to their smartphones, the Shazam app allows our theatre partners to engage directly with their patrons to market online tickets, upcoming films and concession products. This unique marketing tool will also allow our advertising clients and network affiliates to distribute coupons and other value-added elements. Our consumer facing websites and the Shazam mobile app extend the reach of our FirstLook pre-show to consumers online and on their mobile devices and provide an opportunity to create a unique integrated bundle of marketing products for our clients. In January 2015, we launched our new digital product, Cinema Accelerator that targets moviegoers. Cinema Accelerator identifies moviegoers through exclusive first party data sources including, geo-location services, beacons and ticket sales data for the moviegoers that enter the theatres in our network. Using the moviegoer as our filter, we can target specific demographics, genres or layer on other data to provide to our clients as a comparison against their audience. This service is provided through multiple channels, including online and mobile banners, online and mobile pre-roll video, tablets and Facebook newsfeed so that wherever the moviegoer is taking their information, we are there to provide it to them,. We are selling Cinema Accelerator through a small digital sales group and through our existing national and local sales organizations. As these online and mobile activities are supported primarily through our existing staff and infrastructure, we believe that new digital revenue could be developed and additional in-theatre advertisements could be sold due to the nature of the integrated marketing packages. We believe that these integrated marketing packages improve branding and advertising recall due to higher frequency of the advertising and allow clients to better evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising. 

Sales and Marketing

We sell our in-theatre and online advertising products through our national, local and regional sales teams. We market our advertising products through our marketing group located primarily in our New York City sales office.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 31 advertising sales and client development related personnel (including management and sales support staff) within our national sales group. During 2015, approximately 42% of the total 

compensation of the national sales staff was related to bonus or commission, which is based on achieving certain sales ta rgets in order to enhance coordination and teamwork. Our national sales organization has proven to be highly profitable and scalable as we have not added a significant number of sales personnel as our network has expanded. Our national sales staff is loc ated in our sales offices in New York City, Woodland Hills (outside Los Angeles), Chicago and Detroit. 

Our local and regional advertising sales staff, comprised of account directors and telesales representatives, is located throughout the country, with each covering an average of 108 screens per representative. Their responsibility is to sell cinema advertising to local clients as well as larger regional advertisers. During 2015, approximately 77% of the compensation for local sales staff was based on an individual sales commission on collected sales. As our network and local business grows, it may require the addition of sales personnel to cover the new markets or screens. As of December 31, 2015, we had 212 sales personnel (including management and sales support staff) within our local and regional sales groups, the majority of which work out of their homes located within the markets they sell.

Over the past several years, we have increased our national and local advertising revenue by expanding our network and the number of clients and client industries through sales outreach and several marketing tactics, including the expansion and improvement of research provided to clients and the addition of client and business development sales executives. We aggressively market and sell directly to clients as well as advertising agencies, including our participation, beginning in 2012, in the television upfront advertising selling process, which is launched each year with a presentation to clients and advertising agencies in New York City during the TV Upfront week. We also on occasion place advertising in national trade publications, and commission third-party market research to assist our sales team. We believe that improved research regarding cinema advertising and expanded analytics about our network has provided our customers with compelling statistical evidence of the superiority of our advertising products relative to television and other traditional advertising mediums based on metrics such as brand recognition, message recall, and likeability. In addition, based on the success of our upfront campaigns, we believe that we are capturing additional market share from traditional advertising media platforms such as broadcast and cable television. Our primary strategy has been to establish cinema advertising as a more accountable and effective advertising medium relative to other media that has not been impacted by the proliferation of the use of digital video recorders (&#8220;DVRs&#8221;) to record television programming. As of December 31, 2015, we had 36 personnel based primarily in New York that focus on the marketing, research and public relations aspects of our advertising business.

Media and Creative Services

Our media and creative services department uses state of the art, proprietary and non-proprietary technologies and practices to ensure the consistent image and sound quality of the FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming that are distributed over our network, creating the highest possible cinema quality presentation for FirstLook , LEN presentations and all of our other in-theatre marketing products. We believe the expertise of this group in optimizing content for cinema playback within our FirstLook pre-show and our internet sites and mobile app has been instrumental in our ability to provide a better experience for the theatre patron, to enhance our ability to attract and retain our on-screen advertising clients and build and retain relationships with network affiliates. We provide a full spectrum of 2-D and 3-D production and post-production services to our advertising clients on a per contract fee basis, or as part of their advertising commitment, including audio enhancements, color correction and noise reduction. Our expertise in cinematic production and our ability to tailor advertisements developed for television, online or mobile to a high-definition cinema playback format facilitates the ability of national advertisers to display content originally provided for television, online or mobile, thus optimizing their original investment to the big-screen presentation. We also offer creative and production services to our clients (primarily local clients), developing full sight, sound and motion high-definition advertisements from concept to completion. This service substantially reduces the obstacles for smaller clients to invest in cinema-quality advertising and ensures a higher quality presentation for cinema patrons. During 2015, we produced and performed post-production services for approximately 47% of the local advertisements that played across our networks. NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members also engage us for the production of their on-screen concession product advertisements and policy trailers.

Technology and Other Corporate Branding 

We utilize our digital media expertise, our proprietary DCS and various digital network technologies to deliver a high quality cinema advertising pre-show to our network theatres. These technologies facilitate the delivery of a high-quality entertainment experience and provide advertising clients a lower cost and more programming flexibility. Moreover, our technology allows significant operational and scheduling flexibility to our advertising clients that can target various demographic groups by location, film rating or film title and measure advertising audience size and efficiently monitor and provide audit data of the on-screen playback.

We employ a satellite network to distribute content to our theatres. Our DCN, which is the combination of a satellite distribution network and a terrestrial network, distributes our FirstLook pre-show content to 20,361 screens, 1,617 theatres and approximately 3.4 million seats, representing 98% of the total attendance of our advertising network as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 90% of our network is equipped with digital cinema projectors and 10% with LCD projectors.

The satellite technology we use provides a cost-effective means to deliver live and pre-recorded digital content to theatres. We employ a variety of technologies that &#8220;wrap&#8221; around the satellite process to help provide uninterrupted service to theatres. For example, our proprietary DCS has automated implementation capabilities that allow for data files to be multicast to specific screens, theatres or groups of screens or theatres throughout our DCN. Our digital content system operated in our network operations center (&#8220;NOC&#8221;) in our Centennial, Colorado headquarters, combined with in-theatre systems that are connected to the Alternative Content Engine (&#8220;ACE&#8221;) are interfaced with our satellite provider network to dynamically control the quality, placement, timing of playback and completeness of content within specific auditoriums. The integrated DCN (including the DCS software) is controlled by our NOC which supports and monitors approximately 99,000 network hardware devices and approximately 598,000 maintenance alarm technology points within the theatre network as of December 31, 2015.

Through our NOC, we have access to and can monitor and initiate repairs to the equipment in our entire digital network of theatres. Our NOC operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Digital content is uploaded from our NOC and distributed through the DCN to theatres in advance of playback. The content is delivered via multicast technology to all theatres in our network and received by our theatre management system where it is held until displayed in specified theatre auditoriums according to its contract terms. Each theatre auditorium has a hardware and software architecture that controls the content to be shown in the auditoriums or over the LEN in the theatre lobby. After the theatre management system receives digital content, confirmation of content playback is returned via satellite to our NOC to be included in &#8220;post&#8221; reports provided to our advertising clients.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key competitive strengths include:

Superior National Advertising Network

We believe that our national advertising network delivers measurable results versus television, online and mobile or other video advertising networks that we compete against, by allowing for targeting of marketing messages primarily based on the film title, rating or film genre group to a large, young and affluent audience, yielding a competitive return on investment for advertisers as compared to traditional national and local media platforms. As a result, we are able to compete effectively for marketing spending by local and national advertisers through our relationships with a diversified group of local and national advertisers and agencies throughout the U.S. The following are the key competitive strengths of our advertising network:

&#160;

&#183; 

Extensive National Market Coverage . Our contractual agreements with NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and network affiliates provide long-term exclusive access, subject to limited exceptions, to the largest network of digitally equipped theatres in the U.S. and allow us to sell advertising to a large percentage of the U.S. markets that are part of our advertising network. As of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#183; 

our advertising network consisted of 20,361 screens that were 100% digital (16,981 operated by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members) located in 1,617 theatres (1,273 operated by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members) in 48 states and the District of Columbia; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the total annual advertising network theatre attendance was approximately 694.7 million (586.6 million from NCM LLC&#8217;s foun ding members), which increased 0.9 % compared to 2014. Our network represented approximately 57% of the total U.S. theatre attendance, with some of the most modern and highly attended theatres in the industry, as measured by screens per location and attendance per screen; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the average screens per theatre in our network was 12.6 screens, 1.8 times the U.S. theatre industry average, and the aggregate annual attendance per screen of theatres included in our network during 2015 was 34,121, versus the U.S. theatre industry average attendance per indoor screen of 33,585, using metrics reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners (&#8220;NATO&#8221;); 

&#160;

&#183; 

our advertising network had theatres in most of the largest U.S. markets, including each of the top 25 DMAs &#174; , 49 of the top 50 DMAs &#174; , and 187 DMAs &#174; in total; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approximately 73% of our screens (73% of our attendance) were located within the top 50 U.S. DMAs &#174; and approximately 33% of our screens (37% of our attendance) were located within the top 10 U.S. DMAs &#174; ; 

&#160;

&#183; 

theatres within our advertising network represented approximately 70%, 68%, and 66% of the total theatre attendance in theatres that showed national advertising in the top 10, top 25 and top 50 U.S. DMAs &#174; , respectively and 62% for all DMAs &#174; , providing a very attractive platform for national advertisers who want exposure in larger markets or on a national basis; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

approximately 90% of our network screens and approximately 96% of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding member screens were connected to higher quality digital cinema projectors that will further improve the on-screen presentation for advertisers and allow us to display 3-D advertising in most of our network theatres. 

We plan to continue to expand our network through the addition of new network affiliates and theatres built or acquired by our founding members and existing network affiliates. Under the terms of the ESAs and common unit adjustment agreement with NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and our network affiliate agreements, all new theatres built or acquired (subject to existing advertising sales agreements) by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members or network affiliates will become part of our network. Since NCM Inc.&#8217;s February 2007 IPO, NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members have added approximately 3,900 net new screens and 36 network affiliates have been added to our network with approximately 2,500 screens. We expect this expansion to continue to improve our geographic coverage and enhance our ability to compete with other national advertising mediums, including television, online and mobile video advertising platforms. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Targeted, Flexible Advertising Medium . Our digital network technology gives us flexibility to distribute content to specific theatres or screens, geographic regions, or demographic groups based on film title, film rating category or film genre. As a result, our clients can deliver an advertising message to a desired demographic group of movie-goers, using high quality sight, sound and motion to specific groups of screens across our entire national digital network. Further, with upgrades to our distribution technology and operating processes, we can provide distribution lead times that are comparable to television and reduce our advertising clients&#8217; operating costs, enabling us to respond quickly to client requests to change advertising content. During 2015, we also began to invest in our inventory management and distribution systems to expand our ability to target audiences by film genre groups and we began the development of a Data Management Platform that we believe will allow us to provide more robust campaign data analytics to our clients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Access to a Highly Attractive Demographic Segment . NCM offers advertisers the ability to reach highly coveted audience segments: young, affluent, and educated. According to Nielsen Cinema Audience Reports for 2015, 53% of the NCM audience were between the ages of 12-34. Further, 35% of NCM moviegoers have a household income greater than $100,000 (versus 27% of the general population) and 38% have received a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher (versus 29% of the general population) according to the 2015 Doublebase GfK MRI Study. These audience demographics provide a more effective environment than most traditional media platforms for targeting highly desired demographic groups. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Engaged Theatre Audience . We believe that cinema advertising benefits from the impact of the big screen, high quality visual presentation, and digital surround sound presented in an engaged, distraction-free theatre environment. Cinema advertising is one of the few advertising mediums where the ability to skip or turn off the marketing messages is limited. According to industry studies, theatre advertising is more effective than 

&#160;

advertising shown on television as measured by unaided recall rates. We believe that the impact of our on-screen advertising (representing 94% of our total advertising revenue) presentation has been further enhanced by the new high quality digital cinema equipment that has been installed in our network theatres. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Superior Audience Measurability . We receive monthly attendance information by film, by rating and by screen for all of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding member theatres and the theatres operated by our network affiliates, which allows us to report to clients the audience size for each showing of a film and our pre-show. We also obtain third-party research that provides us with the percentage of the total attendance that is in their seats at various times prior to the advertised show time. We believe that access to this information and sharing it with our national clients gives us a distinct competitive advantage over traditional media platforms that are based on significant extrapolations of a very small sample of the total audience. 

Scalable, State-of-the-Art Digital Content Distribution Technology

Our use of the combination of a satellite and terrestrial network technology, combined with the design and functionality of our DCS and NOC infrastructure make our network efficient and scalable and allow us to target specific audiences based primarily on film title and rating desired by our advertising clients and provide scheduling timing flexibility that is similar to advertising on television. Our proprietary DCS provides many distribution, scheduling, reporting and auditing features. We currently playback over 4 million digital content files per day through our DCS. Our DCS also provides the ability to program advertisements from our NOC as required by advertising clients, which shortens lead times and provides increased flexibility to change messages or target specific audiences for our advertising clients.

As of December 31, 2015, our advertising network of 20,361 screens was 100% digital. In 2010, we began to connect our DCN to the higher quality digital cinema projectors being installed by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and network affiliates. These digital cinema projectors provide a much higher quality 2-D image and the ability to project 3-D advertising on screens that are equipped with 3-D playback technology.

Our NOC, DCS and other network software also provide us with the capability to directly monitor approximately 99,000 in-theatre network devices and approximately 598,000 maintenance alarm technology points within our theatre network on a near real-time 24/7 basis as of December 31, 2015, providing high network reliability and timely reporting as required by our advertising clients. The scalability of our NOC and distribution technology has allowed us to increase the number of devices and alarm points with minimal additional capital expenditures or personnel, and we expect to benefit from this scalability in the future as we add new theatres from NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members, our existing network affiliate relationships and the addition of new network affiliates. 

Innovative, Branded Digital Pre-Feature Content

We believe that our digital entertainment and advertising pre-feature program, FirstLook , provides a high-quality entertainment experience for patrons and an effective marketing platform for advertisers. We have branded our pre-feature shows, FirstLook , to reinforce our goal of creating the &#8220;first release window&#8221; for advertising into the marketplace, similar to the way that films are released first in cinemas. We partner with leading media, entertainment and technology companies to provide more original content for the audience and more impact for the advertiser. We have designed the FirstLook programs with separate local and national &#8220;pods,&#8221; consistent with the placement on television networks. We also produce a 3-D segment of FirstLook . We believe the ability to distribute 3-D advertisements across our national network is a unique selling proposition versus television, online and mobile and thus will enhance our national advertising revenue growth in the future.

Our relationships with our content partners and PSA sponsors under exclusive multi-year contractual agreements provide high quality entertainment content that is dispersed throughout the show. The multi-year contracts with our content partners, our PSA sponsors, and arrangements to satisfy NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; on-screen marketing obligations to their beverage concessionaires provide a significant upfront revenue commitment, accounting for approximately 30% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. According to customer research conducted by us and independent research companies, the production of a higher quality branded pre-feature program improves the entertainment experience for patrons as well as the effectiveness of the advertising message.

Integrated Marketing Products 

Along with our on-screen advertising opportunities, we offer advertisers the opportunity to integrate and reinforce their on-screen advertisements with various online and mobile marketing and in-lobby and LEN marketing.

&#160;

&#183; 

Our online and mobile marketing products include advertisement placement on our firstlookonline.com and movienightout.com websites and on our Movie Night Out mobile app and Shazam&#8217;s app, as well as, through our Cinema Accelerator product. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our in-lobby marketing programs include advertisements displayed on our LEN high-definition television screens, posters, tickets, box office coupon handouts, popcorn bags and beverage cups and on-site product sampling opportunities. According to a Nielsen survey of moviegoers for 2015, movie patrons spend, on average, approximately 13 minutes in the theatre lobby (before, during and after the last movie that they viewed in the theatre). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our creative personnel and our marketing team assist advertisers in creating entertaining, fully integrated online and cinema marketing campaigns with maximum impact. 

Exposing patrons to an integrated marketing campaign of online, mobile, in-lobby and on-screen advertising creates a consistent marketing message through multiple touch points during the entire movie-going experience. The marketing interaction for our clients begins when consumers choose a film or event online or on mobile devices and continues through the subsequent entertainment experience in the theatre, lobbies, and through marketing pre-shows prior to the feature film and extends beyond the theatre experience through subsequent online/mobile interaction. We believe these multiple marketing impressions through the entire entertainment experience allows our advertisers to extend the exposure for their brands and products and create a more engaging &#8220;relationship&#8221; with the consumer that is not available with broadcast or cable television or traditional display advertising.

Strong Operating Margins with Limited Capital Requirements

Our annual Adjusted OIBDA margins have been consistently strong, ranging from approximately 49% to 52% over the last five years. Refer to &#8220;Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data&#8221; for a discussion of the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and the reconciliation to consolidated net income. In addition, NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and their Digital Cinema Integration Partners, LLC (&#8220;DCIP&#8221;) joint venture have invested substantial capital to deploy, expand and upgrade the network equipment within their theatres including the recent deployment of the higher quality digital cinema equipment. Due to the network equipment investments made by NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and network affiliates (in some cases through the DCIP digital cinema implementation joint venture) in new and acquired theatres and the requirements in the ESAs for the founding members to make future investments for equipment replacements, and the scalable nature of our NOC and other infrastructure, we do not expect to make major capital investments to grow our operations as our network of theatres expands. The combination of our strong operating margins and our low capital expenditures, ranging from approximately 2% to 3% of revenues over the last five years, has allowed us to generate significant unlevered free cash flow (defined as operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation costs, merger-related administrative costs and CEO transition costs and minus capital expenditures) before distributions to NCM LLC&#8217;s owners. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our capital expenditures were $13.0 million, of which $1.1 million primarily related to investments in network equipment to add new network affiliate theatres. We believe our expected level of unlevered free cash flow generation should provide us with the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue the further expansion of our national theatre network, invest in other growth opportunities and continue to make dividend payments to our stockholders.

Dividend Policy

Our dividend policy is described in &#8220;Item 5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8212;Dividend Policy&#8221;.

Our Strategy

We believe that our theatre advertising network and management competencies, will provide us with an opportunity to be a strong competitor in the national and local advertising marketplace. We believe that because our business is not being 

adversely impacted by the DVR and television programming fragmentation, it will allow us to gain market share within the broader video advertising marketplace. Our primary strategic initiatives are to: 

Expand and Improve the Quality of Our Theatre Network

Expanding our Geographic Coverage and National Reach . We continue to expand the reach and geographic coverage of our national digital network by connecting additional theatres to our network that NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members or our network affiliates buy or build and by entering into additional long-term network affiliate agreements with other theatre circuits. The ESAs require that all of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; new or acquired theatres be added to our network in return for the issuance of new NCM LLC units. In addition to the continued expansion of our theatre network through the acquisition and new construction activities of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members, our strategy is to continue to create new relationships with regionally located network affiliates with theatres in smaller markets where we do not currently have significant (or in many cases any) market coverage. By increasing our advertising reach and broadening our geographic coverage, we believe we will be better able to compete with other national advertising platforms such as television networks and new emerging advertising platforms distributed over the internet and on mobile devices. 

Improving the Technical Quality and Content Presentation of Our Network . Our production and distribution capabilities have been transitioned to the new digital cinema platform, including the ability to distribute and display 3-D advertising. As of December 31, 2015, 18,223 total screens (including network affiliates) within our digital network were connected to digital cinema projection equipment, representing approximately 90% of our network screens. In order to provide for the connection of the new higher quality digital cinema equipment to our network, we agreed to an amendment of the ESAs that increased NCM LLC&#8217;s founding member theatre access fee (and reduced certain maintenance costs as LCD projectors were replaced) as the digital cinema system is connected to our advertising network. 

Upgrading Our Sales and Inventory Management Systems and Our Ability to Better Target Specific Theatre Audiences for Our Clients . Over the last several years we have been upgrading our sales and inventory management systems to provide our local, regional and national sales personnel the ability to respond to client requests for proposals more quickly and provide sales management more timely visibility to our inventory availability and pricing trends. In addition, we are continually upgrading our DCS scheduling and distribution software to provide more effective targeting of advertisements toward specific theatre audiences. In 2014, we began to enhance these existing management systems to provide the ability to target specific theatre audiences more effectively based on film genre group or other criteria desired by our advertising clients. During 2015, we also began development of a Data Management Platform that will allow us to provide more robust audience data and other analytics associated with specific client campaigns. 

Expand Our Advertising Client Base

National Advertising . We intend to increase our market share of U.S. advertising spending by: (i) launching an aggressive sales, marketing and public relations strategy that highlights the positive attributes of our marketing product compared to other national video networks, including adjacency to high quality programming, a higher quality advertising impression that cannot be skipped and more placement certainty and transparency than online and mobile networks, (ii) launching a national upfront marketing and sales campaign that leverages and builds on the success of our upfront campaigns and provides dynamic pricing that is responsive to week-to-week market demand and inventory availability, (iii) increasing our investment in obtaining theatre patron and other data to feed our new audience targeting systems, (iv) expanding our research staff and their capabilities to better validate our selling proposition and the return on investment for advertising clients relative to other advertising networks and (v) creating a more robust integrated marketing product that bundles our on-screen, lobby promotions and online and mobile platforms (see more discussion below). These strategies are designed to expand our relationships with existing advertising clients and broaden our advertising client base in new and existing client industries. 

Over the last several years our national sales team was successful in this effort to expand our national client base, as we added 46 clients in 2015 that were first time clients or had not advertised with us since our IPO. These new clients added in 2015 included companies in the apparel, auto parts, computer software, education, electronics, health, home audio/video equipment, insurance, internet, liquor, movie studio, personal care, pharmaceutical, pet store, prepared food, restaurant, spas, sporting good, supermarket, telecommunications and video game industries. We have expanded our client base by approximately 108% to 470 national advertisers from 2009 through the end of 2015. Despite this growth, we believe there are still thousands of clients that currently advertise on television, the internet or on mobile devices that do not use our 

network. For instance, our share of spending by clients in the quick-service restaurant (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), consumer package goods (&#8220;CPG&#8221;) and retailer industries, am ong other industries, is relatively low compared to television, online and mobile. 

Beginning in 2012, we began to participate in the television upfront advertising selling process, including a presentation in New York City in early May during the TV Upfront week. In 2015, this upfront strategy yielded positive results as we believe the increased market awareness among media buyers and clients created during the previous year&#8217;s upfront presentations raised our credibility and allowed us to gain upfront commitments traditionally made exclusively to cable and broadcast television networks, and more recently online and mobile networks. We believe that over time, this greater shift toward more upfront commitments, allows us to bundle several flights throughout the year will help to increase our share of video advertising spending by increasing the number of clients and client industries that buy our network and stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter CPM volatility by increasing overall inventory utilization and balancing that utilization throughout the year. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase that could reduce what is ultimately spent by clients that have made upfront commitments and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.

Local and regional advertising . We intend to increase our market share of local and regional advertising spending by: (i) aggressively marketing our local and regional advertising products, including direct marketing campaigns to businesses within a specified radius of our network theatres and through our partnership with STRATA, a software company, whereby local and regional advertisers may purchase advertising on our network in the spot marketplace using STRATA&#8217;s software. (ii) aggressively bundling theatre lobby promotions with on-screen campaigns, (iii) continuing to add high quality local salespeople and sales management executives to better cover the existing and new network theatres, particularly those with low inventory utilization, (iv) continuing to strengthen our regional sales team to focus exclusively on larger regional clients, such as car dealer associations, state agencies, insurance companies, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, casual dining, tourism, education, healthcare and retail, that operate across an entire DMA &#174; , multiple DMAs &#174; or states, (v) providing access to better FirstLook inventory for our regional advertising clients, (vi) improving proposal and inventory management systems, (vii) continuing to implement more robust training to support our local sales directors and sales management and (viii) exploring expansion into new regional marketplaces. Due to the relatively low percentage of local advertising inventory sold today in many of our theatres, we believe that an opportunity exists to continue to expand our local and regional business. We have also benefited from our efforts to reduce local salesperson attrition, providing balanced commissions and benefit packages and training and other corporate support. 

Expand Our Internet/Mobile Platform

Advertising clients are increasingly seeking new ways to create integrated marketing solutions across multiple digital platforms. By bundling our on-screen and in-theatre promotional marketing products with online, mobile and video playback inventory, we allow clients to benefit from a bundle of digital marketing products focused on the entertainment consumer. During 2015, we launched a new digital product, Cinema Accelerator , that targets frequent movie-goers in addition to the sale of our 100% owned consumer sites, firstlookonline.com and movienightout.com and our mobile app, Movie Night Out . In 2014, we also entered into a strategic marketing and selling relationship with the popular Shazam app to allow our clients to use their on-screen advertisements to directly engage movie-goers through their smartphones.

Continue to Attract and Retain High Quality Management and Staff

Our success is very much tied to the quality of our management and staff. In order to ensure that we retain and attract high quality personnel, we seek to maintain a culture that focuses on teamwork and personal growth, as well as, maintain effective and transparent lines of communication. We also make meaningful investments in internal, as well as external, training programs for our management and staff to ensure that our personnel have the technical and sales, as well as, management skills to drive our business growth. We have adopted a succession plan that includes short-term and long-term planning elements to allow us to successfully continue operations should any of our senior management team become unavailable to us, which we executed when our Chief Executive Officer announced his resignation in August 2015.

Intellectual Property Rights

We have been granted a perpetual, royalty-free license from NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members to use certain proprietary software for the delivery of digital advertising and other content through our DCN to screens in the U.S. We have made 

improvements to this software since the IPO date and we own those improvements exclusively, except for improvements that were developed jointly by us and NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members. 

We have secured U.S. trademark registrations for NCM, National CineMedia, NCM Media Networks, and Movie Night Out . It is our practice to defend our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, including the associated goodwill, from infringement by others. We are aware that other persons or entities may use names and marks containing variations of our registered trademarks and other marks and trade names. Potentially, claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, such as trademark infringement, could be brought against us by the users of those other names and marks. If any such infringement claim were to prove successful in preventing us from either using or prohibiting a competitor&#8217;s use of our registered trademarks or other marks or trade names, our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted.

Customers

Advertising Customers . Our advertising business has a diverse customer base, consisting of national and local advertisers. As of December 31, 2015, we had displayed advertising since 2006 with 470 national advertisers across a wide variety of industries. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 69.3% of our advertising revenue from national clients (including advertising agencies that represent our clients), 6.7% from NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members&#8217; beverage agreements and 24.0% from our relationships with thousands of local advertisers across the country (including advertising agencies that represent these clients). 

Each of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members has a relationship with a beverage concessionaire under which they are obligated to provide on-screen advertising time as part of their agreement to purchase branded beverages sold in their theatres. During the first six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to each of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and during the last six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to two of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members and 30 seconds to one of NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members. The ESAs provide for NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members to purchase this on-screen advertising time at a rate (intended to approximate a market rate) that is provided in the ESA. During 2015, the beverage concessionaire revenue was 6.7% of our total revenue.

Content Partners and PSAs . We have multi-year contractual relationships that provide entertainment content segments in the FirstLook program and minimum annual advertising spending commitments with various entertainment, media, confections and technology companies. These agreements require that the content partners will provide non-commercial content segments that are entertaining, informative or educational in nature and will purchase a specified dollar amount of advertising at a specified CPM over a one or two-year period with options to renew, exercisable at the content partner&#8217;s option. We also have exclusive PSAs reminding moviegoers to silence their cell phones and refrain from texting during feature films. During 2015, the total advertising purchased by these content partners and PSAs represented approximately 23% of our total revenue. 

Competition

Our advertising business competes in the estimated $173 billion U.S. advertising industry with many other forms of marketing media, including television, radio, print media, internet, mobile and outdoor display advertising. While cinema advertising represents a small portion of the advertising industry today, we believe it is well positioned to capitalize on the shift of advertising spending away from traditional media, in particular television, to more targeted and effective forms of digital media. As the number of online and mobile media platforms continues to increase, the ability to achieve ubiquitous coverage of U.S. households has become an important competitive factor. It will also be important to provide clients the ability to target narrow consumer demographic groups and engage directly with individual consumers and to provide measurable third-party marketing information. We believe that proliferation of online and mobile platforms and other technology such as DVRs that enable consumers the ability to consume media (including advertising) when, where and how they want and which provide improved data collection may increase advertisers&#8217; demand for online and mobile advertising platforms and could increase demand for cinema advertising where the risk of advertisements not being viewed is reduced. Thus, our network is well positioned to benefit from several broad market trends, most noticeably the increasing adoption of DVRs and other new digital technology that allows consumers to skip advertisements and the fragmentation of programming to online video platforms. Cinema is one of the few media platforms where consumers cannot skip advertisements.

Through the visual quality and impact of the big screen and surround sound, we are able to display high impact advertising impressions to our audiences. According to Nielsen Brand Effect , cinema advertising has generated ad recall of 

up to three times greater than the same advertising shown on television. Given our recent network expansion and improvements in the capabilities of our digital network technology implemented over the last few years, we are beginning to provide a broader audience and increase the flexib ility to tailor our advertising programs, providing a more entertaining consumer experience and a more effective advertising platform for advertisers. We also believe that as online and mobile video platforms expand with the proliferation of viewing device s, such as larger smartphones and tablets, video programming will become more fragmented and as our national reach expands and we create a higher quality presentation, our network will become even more valuable to marketers. 

Our advertising business also competes with many other providers of cinema advertising, which vary substantially in size. As a large provider of cinema advertising in the U.S., we believe that we are able to generate economies of scale, operating efficiencies and enhanced opportunities for our clients to access a national and local audience as well as allowing us to better compete with television and other national advertising networks. This ability to provide an attractive product to advertisers provides immediate benefits to our network affiliates as our network affiliates are paid through agreements that pay them based upon the advertising revenue generated in their theatres, while NCM LLC&#8217;s founding members benefit through their ownership of NCM LLC.

Employees

We have 634 employees as of December 31, 2015. Our employees are located in our Centennial, Colorado headquarters, in our advertising sales offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Detroit, and our software development office in Minneapolis. We also have many local advertising account executives and field maintenance technicians that work primarily from their homes throughout the U.S. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.

Government Regulation

Currently, we are not subject to regulations specific to the sale and distribution of cinema advertising. We are subject to federal, state and local laws that govern businesses generally such as wage and hour and worker compensation laws.
