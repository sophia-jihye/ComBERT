 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 

Acadia Realty Trust (the "Trust") was formed on March 4, 1993 as a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"). All references to "Acadia," "we," "us," "our" and "Company" refer to the Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a fully integrated REIT focused on the ownership, acquisition, redevelopment and management of high-quality retail properties located primarily in high-barrier-to-entry, supply-constrained, densely-populated metropolitan areas in the United States. We currently own, or have an ownership interest in these properties through our Core Portfolio (as defined below) and our Funds (as defined in Item 1. of this Form 10-K). 

All of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, Acadia Realty Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and entities in which the Operating Partnership owns an interest. As of December 31, 2015 , the Trust controlled 95% of the Operating Partnership as the sole general partner. As the general partner, the Trust is entitled to share, in proportion to its percentage interest, in the cash distributions and profits and losses of the Operating Partnership. The limited partners primarily represent entities or individuals that contributed their interests in certain properties or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for common or preferred units of limited partnership interest ("Common OP Units" or "Preferred OP Units," respectively, and collectively, "OP Units") and employees who have been awarded restricted Common OP Units as long-term incentive compensation ("LTIP Units"). Limited partners holding Common OP and LTIP Units are generally entitled to exchange their units on a one-for-one basis for our common shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ("Common Shares"). This structure is referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or "UPREIT." 

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES 

Our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns. We focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective: 

&#8226; 

Own and operate a Core Portfolio of high-quality retail properties located primarily in high-barrier-to-entry, densely-populated metropolitan areas. Our goal is to create value through accretive redevelopment and re-tenanting activities within our existing portfolio and grow this platform through the acquisition of high-quality assets that have the long-term potential to outperform the asset class. 

&#8226; 

Generate additional growth through our Funds in which we co-invest with high-quality institutional investors. Our Fund strategy focuses on opportunistic yet disciplined acquisitions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value, execution on this opportunity and the realization of value through the sale of these assets. In connection with this strategy, we focus on: 

&#9702; 

value-add investments in street retail properties, located in established and "next-generation" submarkets, with re-tenanting or repositioning opportunities, 

&#9702; 

opportunistic acquisitions of well-located real estate anchored by distressed retailers, and 

&#9702; 

other opportunistic acquisitions, which vary based on market conditions and may include high-yield acquisitions and purchases of distressed debt. 

Some of these investments historically have also included, and may in the future include, joint ventures with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets. 

&#8226; 

Maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth. 

Investment Strategy &#8212; Generate External Growth through our Dual Platforms; Core Portfolio and Funds 

The requirements that acquisitions be accretive on a long-term basis based on our cost of capital, as well as increase the overall Core Portfolio quality and value, are key strategic considerations to the growth of our Core Portfolio. As such, we constantly evaluate the blended cost of equity and debt and adjust the amount of acquisition activity to align the level of investment activity with capital flows. 

Given the growing importance of technology and e-commerce, many of our retail tenants are appropriately focused on omni-channel sales and how to best utilize e-commerce initiatives to drive sales at their stores. In light of these initiatives, we have found retailers are becoming more selective as to the location, size and format of their next-generation stores and are focused on dense, high-traffic retail corridors, where they can utilize smaller and more productive formats closer to their shopping population. Accordingly, our focus for Core Portfolio and Fund acquisitions is on those properties which we believe will not only remain relevant to our tenants, but become even more so in the future. 

In addition to our Core Portfolio investments in real estate assets, we have also capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition, redevelopment, leasing and management of retail real estate by establishing discretionary opportunity funds. Our Fund platform is an investment vehicle where the Operating Partnership invests, along with outside institutional investors, including, but not limited to, endowments, foundations, pension funds and investment management companies, in primarily opportunistic and value-add retail real estate. To date, we have launched four funds ("Funds"); Acadia Strategic Opportunity Fund, LP ("Fund I"), Acadia Strategic Opportunity Fund II, LLC ("Fund II"), Acadia Strategic Opportunity Fund III LLC ("Fund III") and Acadia Strategic Opportunity Fund IV LLC ("Fund IV"). Due to our level of control, we consolidate these Funds for financial reporting purposes. Fund I and Fund II also include investments in operating companies through Acadia Mervyn Investors I, LLC ("Mervyns I"), Acadia Mervyn Investors II, LLC ("Mervyns II") and, in certain instances, directly through Fund II, all on a non-recourse basis. These investments comprise and are referred to as the Company's Retailer Controlled Property Venture ("RCP Venture"). As of December 31, 2015, Fund I has been liquidated. 

The Operating Partnership is the sole general partner or managing member of the Funds and Mervyns I and II and earns priority distributions or fees for asset management, property management, construction, redevelopment, leasing and legal services. Cash flows from the Funds and the RCP Venture are distributed pro-rata to their respective partners and members (including the Operating Partnership) until each receives a certain cumulative return ("Preferred Return"), and the return of all capital contributions. Thereafter, remaining cash flow is distributed 20% to the Operating Partnership ("Promote") and 80% to the partners or members (including the Operating Partnership). 

See Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this Form 10-K ("Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"), for a detailed discussion of the Funds and RCP Venture. 

Capital Strategy &#8212; Balance Sheet Focus and Access to Capital 

Our primary capital objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices, including moderate use of leverage, while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth. We intend to continue financing acquisitions and property redevelopment with sources of capital determined by management to be the most appropriate based on, among other factors, availability in the current capital markets, pricing and other commercial and financial terms. The sources of capital may include the issuance of public equity, unsecured debt, mortgage and construction loans, and other capital alternatives including the issuance of OP Units. We manage our interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt and, where we use variable rate debt, through the use of certain derivative instruments, including London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") swap agreements and interest rate caps as discussed further in Item 7A. of this Form 10-K. 

During January 2012, we launched an at-the-market ("ATM") equity issuance program which provides us an efficient and low-cost vehicle for raising public equity to fund our capital needs. Through this program, we have been able to effectively "match-fund" a portion of the required equity for our Core Portfolio and Fund acquisitions through the issuance of Common Shares over extended periods employing a price averaging strategy. In addition, from time to time, we have issued and intend to continue to issue equity in follow-on offerings separate from our ATM program. Net proceeds raised through our ATM program and follow-on offerings are primarily used for acquisitions, both for our Core Portfolio and our pro-rata share of Fund acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. 

Common Share issuances for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:

Note: 

(1) This activity includes 1.2 million shares issued during the fourth quarter of 2015, which generated gross proceeds of $38.0 million and net proceeds of $37.5 million. 

During 2013 and 2014, we also issued 1.2 million and 1.6 million OP Units, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of properties. During January 2016, we issued 0.9 million OP Units in connection with the acquisition of a property. 

Operating Strategy &#8212; Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record 

Our senior management team has decades of experience in the real estate industry. We have capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition, redevelopment, leasing and management of retail real estate by creating value through property redevelopment, re-tenanting and establishing joint ventures, such as the Funds, in which we earn, in addition to a return on our equity interest, Promotes, priority distributions and fees. 

Operating functions such as leasing, property management, construction, finance and legal (collectively, the "Operating Departments") are generally provided by our personnel, providing for a vertically integrated operating platform. By incorporating the Operating Departments in the acquisition process, acquisitions are appropriately priced giving effect to each asset&#8217;s specific risks and returns and transition time is minimized allowing management to immediately execute on its strategic plan for each asset. 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES 

Core Portfolio 

Our Core Portfolio consists primarily of high-quality street retail and urban assets, as well as suburban properties located in high-barrier-to-entry, densely-populated trade areas. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we continued to execute on our strategy of owning a superior Core Portfolio by acquiring, through our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, properties consistent with our existing portfolio for an aggregate purchase price of $204.2 million. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for a detailed discussion of these acquisitions and Item 2. Properties for a description of the other properties in our Core Portfolio. Additionally, subsequent to December 31, 2015, we acquired a 49% interest in a property for $39.8 million. 

&#32;As we typically hold our Core Portfolio properties for long-term investment, we periodically review the portfolio and implement programs to renovate and re-tenant targeted properties to enhance their market position. This in turn is expected to strengthen the competitive position of the leasing program to attract and retain quality tenants, increasing cash flow, and consequently, property values. From time to time, we also identify certain properties for disposition and redeploy the capital for acquisitions and for the repositioning of existing properties with greater potential for capital appreciation. During 2015, there were no dispositions within the Core Portfolio. 

We also make investments in first mortgages, preferred equity and other notes receivable collateralized by real estate, ("Structured Finance Program") either directly or through entities having an ownership interest therein. During 2015, we made investments 

totaling $41.4 million in this program and as of December 31, 2015 had $147.2 million invested in this program. See Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for a detailed discussion of our Structured Finance Program. 

Funds 

During 2015, the Operating Partnership acquired an additional 4.6% interest in Fund III from a limited partner for $7.3 million, giving the Company an aggregate 24.5% interest in Fund III. During January 2016, the Operating Partnership acquired an additional 8.3% interest in Fund II from a limited partner for $18.4 million, giving the Company an aggregate 28.3% interest in Fund II. 

Acquisitions 

Fund II 

During 2015, Fund II acquired an additional 43% interest in Tower I of its City Point Development located in Brooklyn, NY. Fund II now owns 95% of this development project. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of this acquisition. 

Fund IV 

During 2015, Fund IV acquired seven properties for an aggregate purchase price of $146.1 million. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these acquisitions. 

During February 2016, Fund IV closed on a $14.0 million preferred equity investment in a development site in Chicago, Illinois. 

Dispositions 

Fund II 

During 2015, Fund II sold the residential air rights in Phase III of its City Point project located in Brooklyn, NY for a sales price of $115.6 million, and a property located in Queens, NY for $24.0 million. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these dispositions. 

Fund III 

During 2015, Fund III sold three properties located in Chicago, IL, Shrewsbury, MA and Baltimore, MD for an aggregate sales price of $188.0 million. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for a detailed discussion of these dispositions. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Fund III sold a 65% interest in Cortlandt Town Center for $107.3 million. 

Redevelopment Activities 

As part of our Fund strategy, we invest in real estate assets that may require significant redevelopment. As of December 31, 2015, the Funds had 10 redevelopment projects, consisting of 30 individual properties, four of which are under construction and six are in various stages of the redevelopment process as follows:

(4) Phases I and II have an estimated completion date of 2016. Phase III has an estimated completion date of 2020. 

RCP Venture 

Through Mervyns I and II, and in certain instances, Fund II, we have opportunistically made investments through our RCP Venture in surplus or underutilized properties owned by retailers. While we are primarily a passive partner in the investments made through the RCP Venture, historically we have provided our services in reviewing potential acquisitions and operating and redevelopment assistance in areas where we have both a presence and expertise. To date, we have invested an aggregate $63.2 million in our RCP Venture on a non-recourse basis. See Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the RCP Venture. 

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS 

For information relating to environmental laws that may have an impact on our business, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Possible liability relating to environmental matters." 

COMPETITION 

There are numerous entities that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants that will lease space in our properties. Our competitors include other REITs, financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, private companies and individuals. Our properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses) and the design and condition of the improvements. 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT MARKET SEGMENTS 

We have three reportable segments: Core Portfolio, Funds and Structured Financing. Structured Financing consists of our notes receivable and related interest income. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies set forth in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate property 

performance primarily based on net operating income before depreciation, amortization and certain nonrecurring items. Investments in our Core Portfolio are typically held long-term. Given the contemplated finite life of our Funds, these investments are typically held for shorter terms. Priority distributions and fees earned by us as general partner or managing member of the Funds are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding, among other things, revenues from external customers, a measure of profit and loss and total assets with respect to each of our segments. Our profits and losses for both our business and each of our segments are not seasonal. 

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND EMPLOYEES
