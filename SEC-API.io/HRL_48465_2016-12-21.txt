 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

(a) General Development of Business 

&#160; 

Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as Geo. A. Hormel &#38; Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this line of business. The Company&#146;s name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States and internationally. Although pork and turkey remain the major raw materials for its products, the Company has emphasized for several years the manufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items rather than the commodity fresh meat business. The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth, new product development, and acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Internationally, the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned subsidiary. HFIC has a presence in the international marketplace through joint ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and the Philippines. HFIC has a global presence with a minority position in a food company in the Philippines (The Purefoods-Hormel Company, Inc., 40% holding). 

&#160; 

On May 26, 2016, the Company acquired Justin&#146;s, LLC (Justin&#146;s) of Boulder, Colorado, for a preliminary purchase price of $280.9 million. The transaction provides a cash flow benefit resulting from the amortization of the tax basis of assets, the net present value of which is approximately $70.0 million. The purchase price is preliminary pending final purchase accounting adjustments, and was funded by the Company with cash on hand and by utilizing short-term financing. This acquisition allows the Company to enhance its presence in the specialty natural and organic nut butter category. 

&#160; 

On July 13, 2015, the Company acquired Applegate Farms, LLC (Applegate) of Bridgewater, New Jersey, for a final purchase price of $774.1 million in cash. The purchase price was funded by the Company with cash on hand and by utilizing short-term financing. This acquisition allows the Company to expand the breadth of its protein offerings to provide consumers more choice in this fast growing category. 

&#160; 

On May 9, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands resulting in proceeds, net of selling costs, of a preliminary closing price of $110.1 million, pending working capital adjustments. 

&#160; 

At the end of fiscal year 2016, the Company was actively marketing Clougherty Packing, LLC, parent company of Farmer John and Saag&#146;s Specialty Meats, along with PFFJ, LLC, farm operations in California, Arizona, and Wyoming. In November 2016, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of those businesses and assets. 

&#160; 

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. 

&#160; 

The Company had no other significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, or in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. 

&#160; 

(b) Segments 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s business is reported in five segments: Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS), Specialty Foods, and International &#38; Other. Net sales to unaffiliated customers, operating profit, total assets, and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, are reported in Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Stockholders&#146; Report for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016, incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160;

Reporting of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail, foodservice, or international. Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the Company&#146;s general-purpose financial statements. 

&#160; 

The Perishable category includes fresh meats, frozen items, refrigerated meal solutions, sausages, hams, guacamole, and bacon (excluding JOTS products). The Poultry category is composed primarily of JOTS products. Shelf-stable includes canned luncheon meats, peanut butter, chilies, shelf-stable microwaveable meals, hash, stews, salsas, flour and corn tortillas, tortilla chips, and other items that do not require refrigeration. The Miscellaneous category primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements, sugar and sugar substitutes, dessert and drink mixes, and industrial gelatin products. 

&#160; 

Domestically, the Company sells its products in all 50 states. The Company&#146;s products are sold through its sales personnel, operating in assigned territories or as dedicated teams serving major customers, coordinated from sales offices located in most of the larger U.S. cities. The Company also utilizes independent brokers and distributors. As of October 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 850 sales personnel engaged in selling its products. Distribution of products to customers is primarily by common carrier. 

&#160; 

Through HFIC, the Company markets its products in various locations throughout the world. Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, China, England, Japan, Mexico, Micronesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea. The distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China operations own and operate their own delivery system. The Company, through HFIC, has licensed companies to manufacture various Company products internationally on a royalty basis, with the primary licensees being Tulip International of Denmark and CJ CheilJedang Corporation of South Korea. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The Company has, for the past several years, been concentrating on branded products for consumers with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity-type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. The Company&#146;s expanding line of branded products has reduced, but not eliminated, the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations. 

&#160; 

The majority of the hogs harvested by the Company are purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in Minnesota, Iowa, Utah, Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado. The cost of hogs and the utilization of the Company&#146;s facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the United States. The Company uses supply contracts to ensure a stable supply of raw materials. The Company&#146;s contracts are based on market-based formulas and/or the cost of production, to better balance input costs with customer pricing, and all contract costs are fully reflected in the Company&#146;s reported financial statements. In fiscal 2016, the Company purchased 94 percent of its hogs under supply contracts. The Company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms that it either owns or operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Wyoming. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, JOTS raised turkeys representing approximately 76 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and branded turkey products. Turkeys not sourced within the Company are contracted with independent turkey growers. JOTS&#146; turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. 

&#160; 

Production costs in raising hogs and turkeys are subject primarily to fluctuations in feed grain prices and, to a lesser extent, fuel costs. To manage this risk, the Company hedges a portion of its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, the cost and supply of avocados, peanuts, whey, and natural and organic protein are impacted by the changing market forces of supply and demand, which can impact the cost of the Company&#146;s products. The Company uses long-term supply contracts and forward buying in an attempt to manage these risks. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The Company has three plants that harvest hogs for processing. Quality Pork Processors, Inc. of Dallas, Texas, operates the harvesting facility at Austin, Minnesota, under a custom harvesting arrangement. The Company currently has seven turkey harvest and processing operations, and 28 facilities that produce and distribute other manufactured items. Albert Lea Select Foods, Inc. operates the processing facility at Albert Lea, Minnesota, under a custom manufacturing agreement. Company products are also custom manufactured by several other companies. The following are the Company&#146;s larger custom manufacturers: Abbyland Foods, Inc., Abbotsford, Wisconsin; Agropur Division Natrel USA, Maplewood, Minnesota; Algood Food Company, Louisville, Kentucky; Busseto Foods, Inc., Fresno, California; Deitz &#38; Watson, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Fratelli Beretta USA, Mount Olive, New Jersey; HP Hood LLC, Lynnfield, Massachusetts; John F. Martin and Sons, Stevens, Pennsylvania; Jones Dairy Farm, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin; OSI Industries LLC, Chicago, Illinois; Perdue Farms Inc., Salisbury, Maryland; Reichel Foods, Inc., Rochester, Minnesota; Reser&#146;s Fine Foods, Topeka, Kansas; and West Liberty Foods, LLC, West liberty, Iowa. Exel, Inc., based in Westerville, Ohio, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and Osceola, Iowa. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

There are numerous patents and trademarks important to the Company&#146;s business. The Company holds 46 U.S.-issued and 19 foreign patents. Most of the trademarks are registered. Some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used by the Company or its affiliates are: 

&#160; 

HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, APPLEGATE, AUSTIN BLUES, BACON 1, BLACK LABEL, BREAD READY, CAF&#201; H, CHI-CHI&#146;S, COMPLEATS, CURE 81, CYTOSPORT, DAN&#146;S PRIZE, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DON MIGUEL, DO&#209;A MARIA, EMBASA, FAST &#145;N EASY, FIRE BRAISED, HERDEZ, HORMEL GATHERINGS, HORMEL VITAL CUISINE, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O, JUSTIN&#146;S, LA VICTORIA, LAYOUT, LLOYD&#146;S, MARY KITCHEN, MUSCLE MILK, NATURAL CHOICE, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PILLOW PACK, RANGE BRAND, REV, ROSA GRANDE, SKIPPY, SPAM, SPECIAL RECIPE, THICK &#38; EASY, VALLEY FRESH, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s patents expire after a term that is typically 20 years from the date of filing, with earlier expiration possible based on the Company&#146;s decision to pay required maintenance fees. As long as the Company intends to continue using its trademarks, they are renewed indefinitely. 

&#160; 

Customers and Backlog Orders 

&#160; 

During fiscal year 2016, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart) represented approximately 13.7 percent of the Company&#146;s revenues (measured as gross sales less returns and allowances), compared to 13.9 percent in fiscal 2015. Wal-Mart is a customer for all five segments of the Company. The five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of segment sales: 46 percent of Grocery Products, 36 percent of Refrigerated Foods, 40 percent of JOTS, 37 percent of Specialty Foods, and 22 percent of International &#38; Other. The loss of one or more of the top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on the results of such segment. Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products. Orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The production and sale of meat and food products in the United States and internationally are highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken, fish, peanut butter, and whey. The Company believes its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foods segment in 2016 were Tyson Foods, Inc. and Smithfield Foods, Inc.; for its Grocery Products segment, Conagra Brands, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Campbell Soup Co., and J. M. Smucker Co.; and for JOTS, Cargill, Inc. and Butterball, LLC. 

&#160; 

All segments compete on the basis of price, product quality and attributes, brand identification, breadth of product line, and customer service. Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company&#146;s strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development continues to be a vital part of the Company&#146;s strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new branded items. The expenditures for research and development for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, were approximately $34.7 million, $32.0 million, and $29.9 million, respectively. There are approximately 155 employees engaged in fulltime research and development, 75 in the area of improving existing products and 80 in developing new products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 21,100 active domestic and foreign employees. 

&#160;
