 Item 1. Business . 

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a global leader in the design, production, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#147;VF,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our&#148; used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

VF&#146;s diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our unparalleled ability to connect with consumers, as diverse as the company&#146;s brand portfolio, creates a unique platform for sustainable, long-term growth. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lead in innovation by delivering new products and experiences that consistently delight customers, to drive core growth and strong gross margins; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Connect with consumers by gaining a deep understanding of their behavior, values and preferences to inspire brand engagement and loyalty; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Serve consumers directly, reaching them across multiple channels &#151; wherever and whenever they shop; and, 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand geographically, taking advantage of VF&#146;s scale within every region and channel in which we operate. 

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. Our largest brands are The North Face &#174; , Vans &#174; , Timberland &#174; , Wrangler &#174; , Lee &#174; , Nautica &#174; , Majestic &#174; and Kipling &#174; . Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations. 

Our direct-to-consumer business includes VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented 27% of VF&#146;s total 2015 revenues. 

Many of our brands sell products in international markets through licensees, agents, distributors and independently-operated partnership stores. To provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we balance our own manufacturing capabilities with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand. In 2015, VF derived approximately 70% of its revenues from the Americas region, 20% from Europe and 10% from its Asia Pacific business. 

For both management and internal financial reporting purposes, VF is organized by groupings of businesses called &#147;coalitions&#148;. The five coalitions are Outdoor &#38; Action Sports, Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Coalition management has the responsibility to build and operate their brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by central functions within VF. 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes VF&#146;s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

&#160; 

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor &#38; Action Sports coalition as we focus on product innovation, extend our brands into new product categories, open additional stores, expand geographically and acquire additional lifestyle brands. 

Jeanswear Coalition 

Our Jeanswear coalition markets denim and related casual apparel products globally. 

The Wrangler &#174; brand offers denim, apparel, accessories and footwear through mass merchants and mid-tier department stores in the U.S., VF-operated stores, and online at www.wrangler.com. Wrangler &#174; westernwear is distributed primarily through western specialty stores, as well as various online retail sites. 

Lee &#174; brand products are sold through mid-tier and traditional department stores in the U.S., and online at www.lee.com. The Rustler &#174; and Riders &#174; by Lee &#174; brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores in the U.S. Our Rock &#160; &#38; Republic &#174; brand has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl&#146;s Corporation that covers all branded apparel, accessories, and other merchandise in the U.S. and Canada. 

Wrangler &#174; and Lee &#174; products outside of the U.S. have a higher fashion consideration and, as a result, higher selling prices. VF&#146;s largest international jeanswear businesses are located in Europe and Asia, where Wrangler &#174; and Lee &#174; products are sold through department, specialty and concession retail stores. We also market Wrangler &#174; and Lee &#174; products to mass merchant, department and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico, as well as to department and specialty stores in South America. In key international markets, we are expanding our reach through VF-operated stores, which are an important vehicle for presenting our brands&#146; image and marketing message directly to consumers. We currently have more than 75 VF-operated stores primarily located in Europe, South America, and Asia, and are continuing to expand our brands in emerging markets. In international markets where VF does not have retail operations, Wrangler &#174; and Lee &#174; products are marketed through distributors, agents, licensees and over 900 single brand or multi-brand partnership stores. 

Our world-class supply chain, including owned manufacturing facilities along with advanced vendor-managed inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retailer customers, gives us a competitive advantage in our U.S. jeanswear business. We receive point-of-sale information from these customers on a daily or weekly basis, at an individual store and style-size-color stock keeping unit level. We then ship products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers&#146; needs. Our system capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customers&#146; sales, demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and optimize their inventory investment. 

We intend to drive growth through superior product innovation, consumer insight and marketing strategies. Growth in the U.S. will be balanced across mass merchant, mid-tier and traditional department stores, and western specialty businesses. International growth will be driven by expansion of our existing businesses in Asia, Latin America and key European markets. 

Imagewear Coalition 

Our Imagewear coalition consists of the Image business (occupational workwear apparel and uniforms) and the Licensed Sports Group (&#147;LSG&#148;) business (owned and licensed athletic apparel). The Image and LSG businesses represent approximately 53% and 47%, respectively, of total coalition revenues. 

The Image business provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in North America and internationally, under the Red Kap &#174; brand (premium workwear), the Bulwark &#174; brand (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical, utility and mining industries) and the Horace Small &#174; brand 

&#160; 

(apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel). Products include a wide range of functionally designed shirts, pants, coveralls and outerwear. Image revenues are significantly correlated with the overall level of employment in the U.S. 

Approximately 70% of Image revenues are from industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production, service and white-collar personnel. Since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, VF&#146;s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market. Our commitment to customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations, enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt. As a result, the Red Kap &#174; and Bulwark &#174; brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market and are growing in the workwear retail market. 

The Image business also develops and manages uniform programs through custom-designed websites for major business customers and governmental organizations. These websites provide the employees of our customers with the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the Internet. 

In our LSG business, we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by major sports leagues, individual athletes and related organizations, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League Players Association, the National Hockey League, the Nippon Professional Baseball League and selected major colleges and universities. In addition, the LSG business is a major supplier of licensed Harley-Davidson &#174; apparel to Harley-Davidson dealerships. 

Under license from Major League Baseball, the Majestic &#174; brand is the official on-field uniform of all 30 major league teams. Majestic &#174; brand adult and youth-size authentic, replica jerseys and fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores, department stores and major league stadiums. Sports apparel and fanwear marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department, mass merchant, sporting goods and athletic specialty stores and e-commerce partners. Our quick response capabilities allow us to deliver products to retailers within hours following major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World Series and conference or division playoff championships. 

We believe there is a strategic opportunity to grow revenues through the continued extension of product and service capabilities to new industrial and service apparel distribution channels, markets, and geographies. 

Sportswear Coalition 

The Sportswear coalition consists of the Nautica &#174; brand and the Kipling &#174; brand&#146;s North American business. The Kipling &#174; brand&#146;s business outside of North America is included in the Outdoor &#38; Action Sports coalition. 

Nautica &#174; brand sportswear is marketed through department stores, specialty stores, VF-operated stores and at www.nautica.com. The Nautica &#174; brand is one of the leading men&#146;s sportswear collection brands in department stores in the U.S. Other Nautica &#174; product lines include men&#146;s outerwear, underwear and swimwear, and men&#146;s and women&#146;s sleepwear. We operate over 80 Nautica &#174; brand stores in premium and better outlet centers across the U.S. 

The Nautica &#174; brand is licensed to independent parties in the U.S. for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women&#146;s swimwear and outerwear, children&#146;s clothing) and for non-apparel categories (e.g., accessories, fragrances, watches, eyewear, footwear, luggage, bed and bath products, furniture). Outside the U.S., Nautica &#174; products are licensed for sale in more than 50 countries, including over 250 Nautica &#174; brand stores operated by independent licensees in Asia, Europe, North and South America and the Middle East. 

&#160; 

The Kipling &#174; brand&#146;s North American business includes handbags, luggage, backpacks, totes and accessories. In the U.S., Kipling &#174; products are sold through department, specialty and luggage stores, more than 30 VF-operated full-price and outlet stores, and at www.kipling.com. In Canada, the Kipling &#174; brand is sold through specialty and department stores. In the U.S., the Kipling &#174; brand has seen significant growth, driven by new stores, comparable store growth, an expanding e-commerce business, and increased distribution. 

We believe there is the potential to grow Nautica &#174; brand revenue and improve profit performance through the growth of core sportswear products, increased average selling prices, improved product assortments and enhanced customer experiences across our wholesale, outlet store, and e-commerce channels. There is also the potential for expanding the Kipling &#174; brand through our handbag and accessories relationship with Macy&#146;s, Inc., e-commerce, travel retail stores, and additional VF-operated stores. 

Contemporary Brands Coalition 

Our Contemporary Brands coalition is focused on premium lifestyle brands, and includes the 7 For All Mankind &#174; , Splendid &#174; and Ella Moss &#174; brands. 

The 7 For All Mankind &#174; brand offers premium denim and related products for women and men. While the core business remains focused on denim, the collection also includes sportswear products, such as knit and woven tops, sweaters, jackets and accessories. The 7 For All Mankind &#174; brand is marketed primarily in North America and Europe through premium department stores, specialty stores, over 80 VF-operated stores and over 40 independently-operated partnership stores. Products are also sold online at www.7forallmankind.com. 

The Splendid &#174; brand offers premium tops and casual apparel for women, men and children, and the Ella &#160; Moss &#174; brand offers premium sportswear for women and girls. These brands, noted for their soft wearable fabrics and vibrant colors, are marketed to upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the U.S. They are also sold through over 30 VF-operated Splendid &#174; brand stores and one Ella Moss &#174; brand store, and at www.splendid.com and www.ellamoss.com. 

Direct-To-Consumer Operations 

Our direct-to-consumer business includes full-price stores, outlet stores, e-commerce, and concession retail locations. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 27% of total VF revenues in 2015 compared with 26% in 2014. 

Our full-price stores allow us to display a brand&#146;s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand&#146;s positioning and promise to consumers. These experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness, education and visibility. VF-operated full-price stores generally provide gross margins that are well above VF averages. 

In addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands. 

Our growing global direct-to-consumer operations include 1,520 stores at the end of 2015. We operate retail store locations for the following brands: Vans &#174; , Timberland &#174; , The North Face &#174; , Kipling &#174; , Nautica &#174; , 7 For All Mankind &#174; , &#160; Lee &#174; , Wrangler &#174; , lucy &#174; , Napapijri &#174; , Splendid &#174; and Ella Moss &#174; . We also operate over 75 VF Outlet &#174; stores in the U.S. that sell a broad selection of excess VF products, as well as other non-VF products. Approximately 70% of VF-operated stores offer products at full price, and the remainder are outlet locations. 

&#160; 

Approximately 60% of our stores are located in the Americas region (55% in the U.S.), 25% in Europe and 15% in the Asia Pacific region. Additionally, we have over 1,100 concession retail stores located principally in Europe and Asia. 

E-commerce is our fastest growing direct-to-consumer channel and represented approximately 16% of our direct-to-consumer business in 2015. We currently market the following brands online: The North Face &#174; , Vans &#174; , Timberland &#174; , Lee &#174; , Kipling &#174; , Wrangler &#174; , 7 For All Mankind &#174; , lucy &#174; , Nautica &#174; , SmartWool &#174; , Napapijri &#174; , JanSport &#174; , Splendid &#174; , Ella Moss &#174; , Eagle Creek &#174; , Eastpak &#174; and Reef &#174; . We continue to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional, country-specific brand sites in Europe and Asia, which enhances our ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience. 

We expect our direct-to-consumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF&#146;s overall growth rate as we continue to drive higher comparable store sales, open new stores and expand our e-commerce presence. We opened 186 stores during 2015, concentrating on the brands where we see higher retail growth potential &#151; Vans &#174; , The North Face &#174; , Timberland &#174; and Kipling &#174; . 

In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3,000 partnership stores. These are primarily mono-brand retail locations selling VF products that have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores are located in Europe and Asia, and are concentrated in the Timberland &#174; , Lee &#174; , The North Face &#174; , Vans &#174; , Wrangler &#174; , Nautica &#174; , Kipling &#174; and Napapijri &#174; brands. 

Licensing Arrangements 

As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products. 

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands. License agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the licensing partners&#146; net licensed products sales. Royalty income was $126.1 million in 2015 (1% of total revenues), primarily from the Nautica &#174; , Vans &#174; , Lee &#174; , Timberland &#174; , and Wrangler &#174; brands. In addition, licensees of our brands are generally required to spend from 1% to 3% of their net licensed product sales to advertise VF&#146;s products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees. 

VF has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties. We market apparel under licenses granted by Major League Baseball, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the National Football League, the National Football League Players Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., major colleges and universities, and individual athletes and related organizations, most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements. 

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution 

Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe. 

VF recently launched three strategic global innovation centers that focus on product innovation in technical apparel, footwear and jeanswear. The centers are staffed with dedicated scientists, engineers and technical designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs, and a deep understanding of technology and new materials. The innovation centers are expected to drive brand equity and sustained long-term growth. 

&#160; 

VF&#146;s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing, procuring and delivering products to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. On an annual basis, VF sources or produces approximately 557 million units spread across more than 30 brands. Our products are obtained from 28 VF-operated manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,900 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60 countries. Additionally, we operate 32 distribution centers and 1,520 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms. 

In 2015, 23% of our units were manufactured in VF-owned facilities and 77% were obtained from independent contractors. Products manufactured in VF facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels. This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment. 

VF operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Europe. A significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants, as well as a smaller percentage of footwear. For these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, leather, rubber, wool, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps, eyelets and laces). In some instances, we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors. Manufacturing in the U.S. includes all Major League Baseball uniforms, along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys, T-shirts and fleece products. Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter&#146;s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold. 

Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product, supplier management, product quality assurance, and transportation and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively. Substantially all products in the Outdoor &#38; Action Sports and Sportswear coalitions, as well as a portion of products for our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs. For most products in our Contemporary Brands coalition, we contract the sewing and finishing of VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based primarily in the U.S. 

Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF&#146;s sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying geographies with a mix of VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifting of production among countries and contractors, (iii) sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State Department. 

All VF-operated production facilities throughout the world, as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF products, must comply with VF&#146;s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices, workers&#146; ages, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards 

&#160; 

and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (&#147;WRAP&#148;), which promotes global ethics in manufacturing. 

VF, through its contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF products at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately 1,900 independent contractor facilities, including those serving our independent licensees, must be pre-certified before producing VF products. This precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF&#146;s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Compliance Guidelines, Factory Audit Procedure and Environmental Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com. 

VF did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2015. Absent any material changes, VF believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through (i) the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution, (ii) increases in the prices of its products and (iii) cost reduction opportunities. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business. 

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and some support more than one brand. A portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers. 

Seasonality 

VF&#146;s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses, and are historically stronger in the second half of the year. On a quarterly basis in 2015, consolidated revenues ranged from a low of 20% of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter, while consolidated operating margin ranged from a low of 9% in the second quarter to a high of 18% in the third quarter. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor &#38; Action Sports coalition, where 19% of the coalition&#146;s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 31% in the third quarter of 2015. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends. 

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter. 

Advertising, Customer Support and Community Outreach 

During 2015, our advertising and promotion expense was $712.6 million, representing 5.8% of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and trade publications, on radio and television, and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments. 

We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and 

&#160; 

concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers&#146; stores, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products. 

We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds, discounts and allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. 

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example, The North Face &#174; brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as The North Face Endurance Challenge &#174; and The North Face Explore Fund &#153; programs. The Timberland &#174; brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the Path of Service &#153; program that offers full-time employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as Earth Day in the spring and Serv-a-palooza in the fall. The Wrangler &#174; brand launched the Tough Enough to Wear Pink &#153; program, which honors and raises money for breast cancer survivors, and the National Patriot Program &#153; , which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen American military veterans and their families. The Vans &#174; brand has hosted annual Vans &#174; Earth Day and Vans &#174; Gives Back Day events in which all employees at brand headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community. The Nautica &#174; brand supports Oceana, a not-for-profit organization focused on ocean conservatism, and charity: water, a not-for-profit organization focused on providing clean, safe water to people in need. In addition, 2015 marked the twentieth year of support for the Lee National Denim Day &#174; event, one of the country&#146;s largest single-day fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over $93 million since its inception to fight breast cancer. VF sponsors the &#147;VF 100&#148; program to honor the 100 VF associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year. 

Sustainability 

VF&#146;s approach to Sustainability and Responsibility (&#147;S&#38;R&#148;) is to responsibly manage its business, from the way it makes, distributes and markets products to the ways it preserves the environment and supports local communities. In 2014, VF launched its inaugural S&#38;R Report, a compilation of the many actions and investments taking place across VF for our businesses to operate in a sustainable manner. During 2015, VF continued to expand its global sustainability infrastructure and governance practices by requiring our top brands to report on their S&#38;R practices and strategies on at least an annual basis. In addition, we are on track to meet our first carbon reduction goal to reduce our carbon footprint by 5% (with a 2009 baseline year). VF also recognized seven U.S.-based distribution centers as being &#147;zero-waste,&#148; meaning at least 95 percent of the waste from these factories will be diverted from landfills through recycling, composting and reuse. Other current initiatives include i) an ongoing partnership with the Better Cotton Initiative to promote sustainable farming methods, ii) retrofitting owned facilities with LED lighting and pursuing LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) certification for new offices and distribution centers, and iii) continuing our innovative approach to responsible chemical management in our supply chain via the CHEM-IQ SM chemical management program, an industry-leading method that allows us to identify and eliminate harmful chemicals before they enter our manufacturing process. In addition, VF announced its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025 at all owned and operated facilities. 

Other Matters 

Competitive Factors 

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF&#146;s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in the apparel, footwear and accessories sector by developing high quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand, investing significant amounts behind existing brands and continuing to evaluate potential acquisitions. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas. Many of VF&#146;s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and marketing of VF&#146;s products and are important to our continued success. We have registered this intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We vigorously monitor and enforce VF&#146;s intellectual property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF does not operate. 

Customers 

VF products are primarily sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass merchants. In addition, we sell products on a direct-to-consumer basis through VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites. Our sales in international markets are growing and represented 36% of our total revenues in 2015, the majority of which were in Europe. 

Sales to VF&#146;s ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the U.S., amounted to 22% of total revenues in 2015, 20% in 2014, and 21% in 2013. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 16% of total revenues in 2015, 15% in 2014, and 16% in 2013. Sales to VF&#146;s largest customer totaled 8% of total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the majority of which were derived from the Jeanswear coalition. 

Employees 

VF had approximately 64,000 employees at the end of 2015, of which approximately 28,000 were located in the U.S. Approximately 600 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good. 

Backlog 

The dollar amount of VF&#146;s order backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole.
