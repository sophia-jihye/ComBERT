(1) 

The investment, square feet and percentage of square feet columns include all owned real estate properties excluding land held for development, construction in progress, and corporate property. The occupancy columns represent the percentage of total rentable square feet leased (including month-to-month and holdover leases), excluding properties classified as held for sale ( one &#32;property as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and two &#32;properties as of December 31, 2014 ). Properties under property operating or single-tenant net lease agreements are included at 100% occupancy. Upon expiration of these agreements, occupancy reflects underlying tenant leases in the building. 

Revenue Concentrations 

The Company&#8217;s real estate portfolio is leased to a diverse tenant base. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company had one &#32;tenant that accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues, including revenues from discontinued operations and that was Baylor Scott &#38; White Health at 10%. The Company had approximately 160 leases with this tenant and its affiliated entities in 22 buildings throughout north and central Texas, including buildings at eight different hospital campuses. 

Expiring Leases 

As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining years to maturity pursuant to the Company&#8217;s single-tenant net leases and multi-tenant occupancy leases were approximately 4.6 years, with expirations through 2033. The table below details the Company&#8217;s lease maturities as of December 31, 2015 , excluding one &#32;property classified as held for sale. &#160;

Includes 102 leases that expired prior to December 31, 2015 and are currently on month-to-month terms. 

See "Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results" in Item 7 for additional information regarding the Company's leases and leasing efforts. 

Liquidity 

The Company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements. The Company expects to meet its liquidity needs through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, equity and debt issuances in the public or private markets and borrowings under commercial credit facilities. 

Business Strategy 

The Company owns and operates healthcare properties that facilitate the delivery of care in primarily outpatient settings. The Company seeks to generate stable, growing income and lower the long-term risk profile of its portfolio of properties by focusing on facilities located on or near the campuses of large, acute care hospitals associated with leading health systems. The Company seeks to reduce financial and operational risk by owning properties in diverse geographic locations with a broad tenant mix that includes over 30 physician specialties, as well as surgery, imaging, cancer and diagnostic centers. To execute its strategy, the Company integrates owning, managing, financing and developing such properties and provides a broad spectrum of real estate services including leasing, property management, acquisition and development. 

2015 &#32;Acquisitions and Dispositions 

The Company acquired eight &#32;medical office buildings and two parcels of land during 2015 &#32;for a total purchase price of $190.1 million , including cash consideration of $156.4 million &#32;and the assumption of mortgage notes payable of $28.4 million &#32;(excluding $0.4 million &#32;fair value adjustment premiums recorded upon acquisition). The weighted average capitalization rate for the eight medical office buildings was 6.0% . 

The Company disposed of nine &#32;properties during 2015 &#32;for a total sales price of $158.0 million , including cash consideration of $153.1 million &#32;and $4.9 million &#32;of closing costs and adjustments. The weighted average capitalization rate for these properties was 5.3% . 

See the Company's discussion regarding the 2015 &#32;acquisitions and dispositions activity in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Competition 

The Company competes for the acquisition and development of real estate properties with private investors, healthcare providers, other REITs, real estate partnerships and financial institutions, among others. The business of acquiring and developing new healthcare facilities is highly competitive and is subject to price, construction and operating costs, and other competitive pressures. Some of the Company's competitors may have lower costs of capital. 

The financial performance of all of the Company&#8217;s properties is subject to competition from similar properties. The extent to which the Company&#8217;s properties are utilized depends upon several factors, including the number of physicians using or referring patients to an associated healthcare facility, healthcare employment, competitive systems of healthcare delivery, and the area&#8217;s population, size and composition. Private, federal and state health insurance programs and other laws and regulations may also have an effect on the utilization of the properties. Virtually all of the Company&#8217;s properties operate in a competitive environment, and patients and referral sources, including physicians, may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time. 

Government Regulation 

The facilities owned by the Company are utilized by medical tenants which are required to comply with extensive regulation at the federal, state, and local levels, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Health Reform Law") and laws intended to combat fraud and waste such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, False Claims Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, requirements for state licensure and criteria for medical tenants to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company's leases generally require the tenant to comply with all applicable laws relating to the tenant's use and occupation of the leased premises. Although lease payments to the Company are not directly affected by these laws and regulations, changes in these programs or the loss by a tenant of its license or ability to participate in government-sponsored reimbursement programs would have a material adverse effect on the tenant's ability to make lease payments and could impact facility revenues to the Company. 

The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent evaluation and change. Government healthcare spending has increased over time; however, changes from year to year in reimbursement methodology, rates and other regulatory requirements have resulted in a challenging operating environment for healthcare providers. Aggregate spending on government reimbursement programs for healthcare services is expected to continue to rise significantly over the next 20 years with population growth and the anticipated expansion of public insurance programs for the uninsured and senior 

populations. However, the profitability of providing care to the rising number of Medicare and Medicaid patients may decline, which could adversely affect tenants' ability to make lease payments to the Company. 

The Health Reform Law was intended to provide for comprehensive reform of the United States' healthcare system and extend health insurance benefits to the uninsured population, with the potential to alleviate high uncompensated care expense to healthcare providers. However, the law also increases regulatory scrutiny of providers by federal and state administrative authorities, lowers annual increases in Medicare payment rates and gradually implements broad cost-saving measures and shared risk-and-reward payment models, driven by value and savings, rather than payment for volume of services. This may slow the growth of healthcare spending, while also requiring providers to expand access and quality of care, presenting the industry and its individual participants with uncertainty and greater financial risk. 

The Health Reform Law continues to be the subject of legal and legislative challenges. The implementation or repeal of the Health Reform Law, in whole or in part, could affect the economic performance of some or all of the Company's tenants and borrowers. The Company cannot predict the degree to which any changes may affect indirectly the economic performance of the Company, positively or negatively. 

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Section 603, lowered Medicare rates effective January 1, 2017, for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments, to the same level of rates for physician-office settings, for those facilities not grandfathered-in under the current Medicare rates as of the law&#8217;s date of enactment, November 2, 2015. This legislation reflects the movement by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services toward reimbursement &#8220;site-neutrality,&#8221; or equalizing Medicare rates across different facility-type settings. While these changes are expected to lower overall Medicare spending, Healthcare Realty&#8217;s medical office buildings that are located on hospital campuses could become more valuable as hospital tenants will keep their higher Medicare rates for on-campus outpatient services. However, the Company cannot predict the amount of benefit from these measures or if other federal budget negotiations will ultimately require cuts to reimbursement rates for services provided in other facility-type settings. The Company cannot predict the degree to which these changes, or changes to the federal healthcare programs in general, may affect the economic performance of some or all of the Company's tenants, positively or negatively. 

The Company expects healthcare providers to continue to adjust to new operating and reimbursement challenges, as they have in the past, by increasing operating efficiency and modifying their strategies to profitably grow operations. 

Legislative Developments 

Each year, legislative proposals for health policy are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, and regulatory changes are enacted by government agencies. These proposals, individually or in the aggregate, could significantly change the delivery of healthcare services, either nationally or at the state level, if implemented. Examples of significant legislation currently under consideration, recently enacted or in the process of implementation, include: 

&#8226; 

the Health Reform Law and proposed amendments and repeal measures and related actions at the federal and state level; 

&#8226; 

quality control, cost containment, and payment system reforms for Medicaid, Medicare and other public funding, such as expansion of pay-for-performance criteria and value-based purchasing programs, bundled provider payments, accountable care organizations, increased patient cost-sharing, geographic payment variations, comparative effectiveness research, and lower payments for hospital readmissions; 

&#8226; 

implementation of health insurance exchanges and regulations governing their operation, whether run by the state or by the federal government, whereby individuals and small businesses purchase health insurance, including government-funded plans, many assisted by federal subsidies that are under ongoing legal challenges; 

&#8226; 

equalization of Medicare payment rates across different facility-type settings; the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Section 603, lowered Medicare payment rates, effective January 1, 2017, for services provided in off-campus, provider-based outpatient departments to the same level of rates for physician-office settings for those facilities not grandfathered-in under the current Medicare rates as of the law&#8217;s date of enactment, November 2, 2015; 

&#8226; 

the continued adoption by providers of federal standards for the meaningful-use of electronic health records, and the transition to ICD-10 coding; 

&#8226; 

anti-trust scrutiny of recently-announced mergers of large health insurance companies; and 

&#8226; 

tax law changes affecting non-profit providers. 

The Company cannot predict whether any proposals will be fully implemented, adopted, repealed, or amended, or what effect, whether positive or negative, such proposals would have on the Company's business. 

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property (such as the Company) may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under, or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs (including government fines and injuries to persons and adjacent property) relating to hazardous or toxic substances. Most, if not all, of these laws, ordinances and regulations contain stringent enforcement provisions including, but not limited to, the authority to impose substantial administrative, civil, and criminal fines and penalties upon violators. Such laws often impose liability, without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances, and may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of a tenant or operator of the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner&#8217;s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or lease such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. A property can also be negatively impacted either through physical contamination, or by virtue of an adverse effect on value, from contamination that has or may have emanated from other properties. 

Operations of the properties owned, developed or managed by the Company are and will continue to be subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the following: the generation, segregation, handling, packaging and disposal of medical wastes; air quality requirements related to operations of generators, incineration devices, or sterilization equipment; facility siting and construction; disposal of non-medical wastes and ash from incinerators; and underground storage tanks. Certain properties owned, developed or managed by the Company contain, and others may contain or at one time may have contained, underground storage tanks that are or were used to store waste oils, petroleum products or other hazardous substances. Such underground storage tanks can be the source of releases of hazardous or toxic materials. Operations of nuclear medicine departments at some properties also involve the use and handling, and subsequent disposal of, radioactive isotopes and similar materials, activities which are closely regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state regulatory agencies. In addition, several of the properties were built during the period that asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other such facilities may be acquired by the Company in the future. The presence of such materials could result in significant costs in the event that any asbestos-containing materials requiring immediate removal and/or encapsulation are located in or on any facilities or in the event of any future renovation activities. 

The Company has had environmental site assessments conducted on substantially all of the properties currently owned. These site assessments are limited in scope and provide only an evaluation of potential environmental conditions associated with the property, not compliance assessments of ongoing operations. While it is the Company&#8217;s policy to seek indemnification relating to environmental liabilities or conditions, even where leases and sale and purchase agreements do contain such provisions, there can be no assurances that the tenant or seller will be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations. In addition, the terms of the Company&#8217;s leases or financial support agreements do not give the Company control over the operational activities of its tenants or healthcare operators, nor will the Company monitor the tenants or healthcare operators with respect to environmental matters. 

Insurance 

The Company carries comprehensive liability insurance and property insurance covering its owned and managed properties, including those held under long-term ground leases. In addition, tenants under long-term single-tenant net leases are required to carry property insurance covering the Company&#8217;s interest in the buildings. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company employed 236 people. The employees are not members of any labor union, and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be excellent.
