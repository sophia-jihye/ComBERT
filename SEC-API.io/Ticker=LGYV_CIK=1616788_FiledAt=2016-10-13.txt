 Item 1. Business &#160; 

We were incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Since September 15, 2015, we have operated through a wholly-owned subsidiary RM Fresh Brands Inc. (&#8220;RM Fresh&#8221;), who services food and beverage retailers and distributors who are looking for innovative, trend-setting products across North America and in international markets. With a focus on sustainable, category changing consumables, RM Fresh acquired the rights to distribute an extensive portfolio of highly desirable brands, including Boxed Water, Cleansify, Uncle Si&#8217;s Iced Tea, Chef 5-Minute Meals, Gurkha Cigars, Shimla Foods, Aloe Gloe and Arriba Horchata. Through a network of sub-distribution partners across Canada, RM Fresh provides national product distribution and brokerage services. RM Fresh has an emerging focus on the United States and Middle East through the establishment of sub-distribution partners. 

&#160; 

On August 31, 2016, in order to fund the ongoing operation and further development of RM, we consented to new third party investments into RM in the approximate total amount of $175,000, made in the form of cash and retirement of indebtedness owed by RM. As result of these new investments into RM, our ownership percentage of the company has been reduced to twenty percent (20%). In addition, we entered into a new Shareholder Agreement with RM, under which our shares in RM are subject to certain restrictions on transfer until such time as we declare a shareholder dividend of our RM shares following a going public transaction by RM, or in the alternative, for one (1) year after RM completes a going public transaction. Further, we disposed of an inter-company liability owed to us by RM in the amount of CDN$166,961.70. The liability was documented under a Demand Promissory Note issued to us by RM. We then assigned the note to an investor in RM in exchange for $3,000. Finally, we entered into a mutual Release agreement with RM. Under the Release, we released and discharged all liabilities owed to us by RM (with the exception of the Demand Promissory Note). RM in turn released us of all liabilities owing to RM and released us all ongoing contractual and financial responsibilities to RM, including our contractual obligation to further fund management fees or other expenses to be incurred by RM. 

&#160; 

Going forward, we are continuing as a holding company owning a 20% ownership stake in RM. Our management is also reviewing additional opportunities for new business.
