&#160;

Summary 

&#160;

The following summary is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report. 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by both our United States operations, and our European operations, the latter, through our 73% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company, as 27% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the NYSE Euronext.

&#160;

Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and deliver them to one of our distribution centers.

&#160;

Our prestige products focus on niche brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every year or two, with some frequent &#8220;seasonal&#8221; fragrances introduced as well.

&#160;

The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand&#8217;s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.

&#160;

As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

&#160;

European Operations 

&#160;

We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 77% of net sales for 2015. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Balmain, Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Montblanc, Paul Smith, S.T. Dupont, Repetto, Rochas and Van Cleef &#38; Arpels , whose products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We own the Lanvin brand name for our class of trade, and license the Montblanc and Jimmy Choo brand names; for the year ended December 31, 2015, sales of product for these brands represented 15%, 21% and 20% of net sales, respectively. 

&#160;

United States Operations 

&#160;

Prestige brand fragrance products are also marketed through our United States operations, and represented 23% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie &#38; Fitch, Agent Provocateur, Anna Sui, Banana Republic, bebe, Dunhill, Hollister, French Connection, Oscar de la Renta, and Shanghai Tang brands. 

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

Montblanc 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we extended our license agreement with Montblanc by five years. The original agreement, signed in 2010, provided us with the exclusive worldwide license rights to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Montblanc brand through December 31, 2020. The new 10-year agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 2016, extends the partnership through December 31, 2025 without any material changes in operating conditions from the prior license. The license agreement is subject to certain minimum sales, advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry.

&#160; 

French Connection 

&#160;

In September 2015, we entered into a 12-year license agreement to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the French Connection brand names. The agreement is subject to certain minimum advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry. The license agreement was subject to certain conditions precedent, which have now been satisfied, and the Company took over distribution of selected fragrances within the brand&#8217;s existing fragrance portfolio in 2016.

&#160; 

Rochas 

&#160; 

In May 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter &#38; Gamble Company. This transaction includes all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas ( Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas , etc.), mainly for class 3 (cosmetics) and class 25 (fashion). Substantially the entire &#8364;106 million purchase price for the assets acquired (approximately $118 million), including approximately $5.4 million in acquisition related expenses, was allocated to trademarks with indefinite lives including approximately $21 million of which was allocated to fashion trademarks. An additional $4.4 million was paid for related inventory.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The cost of the acquisition was paid in cash on the closing date and was financed entirely through a 5-year term loan payable in equal quarterly installments plus interest. In order to reduce exposure to rising variable interest rates, the Company entered into a swap transaction effectively exchanging the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of approximately 1.2%. The swap is a derivative instrument and is therefore recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 

&#160;

Coach 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we entered into an 11-year exclusive worldwide license with Coach, Inc. to create, produce and distribute new men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s fragrances and fragrance related products under the Coach brand name. We will distribute these fragrances globally to department stores, specialty stores and duty free shops, as well as in Coach retail stores beginning in 2016. The agreement is subject to certain minimum sales, advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry.

&#160; 

Fragrance Products 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are the owner of the Rochas brand, and Lanvin brand name and trademark for our class of trade. In addition, we have built a portfolio of licensed prestige brands whereby we produce and distribute our prestige fragrance products under license agreements with brand owners. Under license agreements, we obtain the right to use the brand name, create new fragrances and packaging, determine positioning and distribution, and market and sell the licensed products, in exchange for the payment of royalties. Our rights under license agreements are also generally subject to certain minimum sales requirements and advertising expenditures as are customary in our industry.

&#160;

Fragrance Portfolio &#160;

&#160;

Abercrombie &#38; Fitch and Hollister&#8212; In December 2014, we entered into a 7-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute new fragrances and fragrance related products under the Abercrombie &#38; Fitch and Hollister brand names.

&#160;

Agent Provocateur&#8212; In July 2013, we entered into a 10.5-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under London-based luxury lingerie brand, Agent Provocateur. In 2013, we commenced distribution of selected fragrances within the brand&#8217;s legacy fragrance portfolio and in 2014, we launched our first new Agent Provocateur scents, Fatale and Fatale Pink. In 2016, we plan to launch Agent Provocateur Aphrodisiaque , our second fragrance family for the brand. Agent Provocateur fragrance sales are concentrated in the United Kingdom and the Middle East.

&#160;

Founded in 1994 by Joseph Corr&#233;, and Serena Rees and acquired by the private equity firm, 3i Group plc in 2007, Agent Provocateur is an iconic, globally-recognized brand, breaking new ground with every collection and rightfully earning its place as a benchmark brand in the world of lingerie. It is a brand that is confident, sensual and irreverent. Agent Provocateur celebrates and empowers women with a unique brand image renowned for being provocative and yet always leaving something to the imagination.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In recent years, Agent Provocateur has been opening doors at a steady growth and plans to continue to grow its door count, especially in Asia. Currently, its products which extend into swimwear, bridal and accessories, are sold globally, at 100 of its own boutiques and shop-in-shops within the finest department stores, as well as specialty stores and on-line.

&#160;

Anna Sui&#8212; In June 2011, we entered into a 10-year exclusive worldwide fragrance license agreement to produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Anna Sui brand. Our rights under the agreement commenced on January 1, 2012 when we took over production and distribution of the existing Anna Sui fragrance collections.

&#160;

We are working in partnership with American designer, Anna Sui, and her creative team to build upon the brand&#8217;s growing customer appeal, and develop new fragrances that capture the brand&#8217;s very sweet feminine girly aspect, combined with touch of nostalgia, hipness and rock-and-roll. Anna Sui&#8217;s devoted customer base, which spans the world, is especially strong in Asia.

&#160;

Anna Sui product sales have declined in the past two years primarily owing to the slowdown in the Chinese economy where the brand is especially popular. We have continued to build the brand after our 2013 successful launch of La Vie de Boh&#232;me. In 2015, we released our second new Anna Sui fragrance family, Romantica, and we have several flankers in development for 2016.

&#160;

The Balmain couture house was founded in 1945 by Pierre Balmain. In recent years, Balmain has undergone a significant transformation. With the redefinition of its image in ready-to-wear, the brand has become a reference for style, while retaining its distinctive design codes from the haute couture universe. In doing so, the brand has become a major trendsetter. Our first new Balmain women&#8217;s fragrance, Extatic , made its debut in 2014 in selective distribution and in 2015, we launched a new men&#8217;s scent Balmain Homme .

&#160;

&#160;

Created in 1947 by Rose Repetto at the request of her son, dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, Repetto is today a legendary name in the world of dance. For a number of years it has developed timeless and must-have collections with a fully modernized signature style ranging from dance shoes, ballet slippers, flat shoes, and sandals to more recently handbags and high-end accessories.

&#160;

With Repetto boutiques in 37 countries, the brand is branching out into Asia, notably China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan where its mix of cross-generational appeal and French chic has been met with unprecedented enthusiasm. Our first Repetto fragrance line was launched in 2013 and a floral scent was added in 2015. The brand has experienced gradual sales penetration in France, but slower acceptance internationally.

&#160;

Repetto product sales in 2015 aggregated $8.9 million and represented 1.9% of total sales.

&#160;

Rochas &#8212; In May 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter &#38; Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under H&#233;l&#232;ne Rochas' direction. This transaction included all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas (Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas, etc.), mainly for class 3 (cosmetics) and class 25 (fashion). Substantially the entire &#8364;106 million purchase price for the assets acquired (approximately $118 million) was allocated to trademarks with indefinite lives, including approximately $5.4 million in acquisition related expenses.

&#160;

This acquisition opens up a new page in the Company's history by integrating for the first time both fragrances and fashion. This will allow us to apply a global approach to managing a fragrance brand with complete freedom in terms of creativity and aesthetic choices, as well as a very high degree of visibility to establish a position of even greater preeminence for Rochas in the luxury goods universe. Rochas brand sales currently include approximately $2 million of royalties generated by the fashion and accessory business via its portfolio of license agreements. Our first new fragrance for Rochas is under development, and is expected to launch 2017.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Rochas product sales in 2015 aggregated $13.4 million and represented 2.9% of total sales.

&#160;

Shanghai Tang&#8212; In July 2013, we created a wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Inter Parfums USA Hong Kong Limited, which entered into a 12-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances under China&#8217;s leading luxury brand, Shanghai Tang. Our first Shanghai Tang fragrance collection for men and women debuted in 2015.

&#160;

Founded in 1994, Shanghai Tang is the leading Chinese luxury brand with international recognition and distribution. As the global curator of modern Chinese chic, Shanghai Tang champions the richness and beauty of the Chinese culture through its contemporary lifestyle offer of apparel and accessories for men, women and children, as well as home collections. Shanghai Tang supports an international network of 45 boutiques, including the world&#8217;s largest lifestyle flagship &#8211; The Shanghai Tang Mansion in Hong Kong, and its largest flagship Boutique, The Cathay Mansion in Shanghai, China and on-line.

&#160;

S.T. Dupont&#8212; In June 1997, we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with S.T. Dupont for the creation, manufacture and distribution of S.T. Dupont fragrances. In 2011, the agreement was renewed and now runs through December 31, 2016. S.T. Dupont is a French luxury goods house founded in 1872, which is known for its fine writing instruments, lighters and leather goods.

&#160;

S.T. Dupont fragrances include: S.T. Dupont , S.T. Dupont Essence Pure , S.T. Dupont Noir , S.T. Dupont Blanc , S.T. Dupont Passenger , 58 avenue Montaigne, So Dupont and Paris Saint Germain .

&#160;

S.T. Dupont product sales in 2015 aggregated $11.5 million and represented 2.5% of total sales.

&#160;

&#160; Van Cleef &#38; Arpels&#8212; In September 2006, we entered into an exclusive 12-year worldwide license agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance products under the Van Cleef &#38; Arpels brand and related trademarks.

&#160;

Van Cleef &#38; Arpels fragrances in current distribution include: First , Van Cleef pour Homme , Tsar , Van Cleef , First 1 er Bouquet , F&#233;erie , Collection Extraordinaire , Oriens, Midnight in Paris and R&#234;ve. For 2016, we anticipate launching a new men&#8217;s line, In New York , and a new women&#8217;s line, So First. 

&#160;

Van Cleef &#38; Arpels brand sales in 2015 aggregated $19.4 million and represented 4.2% of total sales.

&#160;

&#160; Business Strategy 

&#160;

Focus on prestige beauty brands . Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company&#8217;s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.

&#160;

Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing . We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce &#8220;seasonal&#8221; fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the smooth and consistent performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, a &#8220;good dose&#8221; of creativity and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.

&#160;

Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions . Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past twenty years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, during 2014, we signed fragrance licenses for Abercrombie &#38; Fitch and Hollister brands, and in 2015, we signed the fragrance license for Coach and French Connection, extended our Montblanc fragrance license and purchased the Rochas brand. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $260 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or outright acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any future agreements, or acquire brands or assets on terms favorable to us, or if we do, that any such transaction will be successful. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.

&#160;

Expand existing portfolio into new categories . We intend to continue to broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Continue to build global distribution footprint . Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, we have formed and are operating joint ventures or distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint ventures arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers&#8217; needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

&#160;

&#160;

Production and Supply 

&#160;

The stages of the development and production process for all fragrances are as follows:

&#160;

&#9679; Simultaneous discussions with perfume designers and creators (includes analysis of esthetic and olfactory trends, target clientele and market communication approach) &#160;

&#9679; Concept choice &#160;

&#9679; Produce mock-ups for final acceptance of bottles and packaging &#160;

&#9679; Receive bids from component suppliers (glass makers, plastic processors, printers, etc.) and packaging companies &#160;

&#9679; Choose suppliers &#160;

&#9679; Schedule production and packaging &#160;

&#9679; Issue component purchase orders &#160;

&#9679; Follow quality control procedures for incoming components; and &#160;

&#9679; Follow packaging and inventory control procedures. &#160;

Suppliers who assist us with product development include : 

&#160;

&#9679; Independent perfumery design companies (Aesthete, Carr&#233; Basset, PI Design, Cent Degres) &#160;

&#9679; Perfumers (IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich, Robertet, Takasago, Mane) which create a fragrance consistent with our expectations and, that of the fragrance designers and creators &#160;

&#9679; Bottle manufacturers (Pochet du Courval, SGD , Verreries Brosse, Bormioli Luigi, Stoelzle Masni&#232;res), caps (Qualipac , ALBEA , RPC, Codiplas, Jackel , CMSI) or boxes (Edelmann, Autajon , Alliora, Nortier , Draeger) &#160;

&#9679; Production specialists who carry out packaging (CCI, Edipar , Jacomo, SDPP, MF Productions, Biopack) or logistics (SAGA for storage, order preparation and shipment) &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Suppliers' accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers' accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations, prestige fragrances, components and contract filling needs are purchased from many different suppliers located around the world. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are primarily sourced, produced and filled in the United States, and our mass market products are primarily manufactured, produced or filled in the United States or China. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160;

Our products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For the majority of our international distribution, we contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.

&#160;

As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, Italy, Spain and Germany. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 100 countries around the world.

&#160;

Approximately 40% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 

&#160;

The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our majority-owned distribution subsidiaries to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.

&#160;

For our United States operations, we distribute product to approved retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Geographic Areas 

&#160;

United States export sales were approximately $66.3 million, $61.0 million and $58.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Consolidated net sales to customers by region are as follows:

Consolidated net sales to customers in major countries are as follows:

&#160;

(in thousands) &#160; Year ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; United States &#160; $ 122,000 &#160; &#160; $ 119,000 &#160; &#160; $ 142,000 &#160; United Kingdom &#160; $ 32,000 &#160; &#160; $ 37,000 &#160; &#160; $ 46,000 &#160; France &#160; $ 34,000 &#160; &#160; $ 50,000 &#160; &#160; $ 47,000 &#160; &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.

&#160;

&#160; Inventory 

&#160;

We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally deliver product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; Product Liability 

&#160;

Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $5.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of &#8364;20.0 million (approximately $22.2 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

A fragrance is defined as a &#8220;cosmetic&#8221; under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may contain menthol and are also classified as a &#8220;drug&#8221;. Under U.S. law, a product may be classified as both a cosmetic and a drug. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are &#8220;drugs&#8221; include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.

&#160;

Our fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.

&#160;

Our fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under various license and other agreements we have the right to use certain registered trademarks throughout the world (except as otherwise noted) for fragrance products. These registered trademarks include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Abercrombie &#38; Fitch &#160; &#9679; Agent Provocateur &#160; &#9679; Anna Sui &#160; &#9679; Balmain &#160; &#9679; Banana Republic &#160; &#9679; bebe &#160; &#9679; Boucheron &#160; &#9679; Coach &#160; &#9679; Dunhill &#160; &#9679; French Connection &#160; &#9679; FCUK &#160; &#9679; Hollister &#160; &#9679; Jimmy Choo &#160; &#9679; Jordache &#160; &#9679; Karl Lagerfeld &#160; &#9679; Montblanc &#160; &#9679; Oscar de la Renta &#160; &#9679; Paul Smith &#160; &#9679; Repetto &#160; &#9679; Shanghai Tang &#160; &#9679; S.T. Dupont &#160; &#9679; Van Cleef &#38; Arpels &#160;

In addition, we are the registered trademark owner of several trademarks for fragrance products, including:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Aziza &#160; &#9679; Rochas &#160; &#9679; Intimate &#160; &#9679; Lanvin &#160; &#9679; Tristar, Regal Collections, Royal Selections and Apple &#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 1, 2016, we had 311 full-time employees worldwide. Of these, 223 are full-time employees of our European operations, with 62 employees engaged in sales activities and 161 in administrative, production and marketing activities. Our United States operations have 88 employees, and of these, 14 were engaged in sales activities and 74 in administrative, production and marketing activities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
