 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

SpartanNash Company (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;SpartanNash&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;) is a leading multi-regional grocery distributor and grocery retailer and the largest distributor, by revenue, of grocery products to military commissaries in the United States. The Company&#8217;s core businesses include distributing grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges and independent and corporate-owned retail stores primarily located in 47 states and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Bahrain, and Egypt. The Company operates three reportable business segments: Military, Food Distribution and Retail. For the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the Company generated net sales of approximately $7.7 billion. 

Established in 1917 as a cooperative grocery distributor, Spartan Stores Inc. (&#8220;Spartan Stores&#8221;) converted to a for-profit business corporation in 1973. In January 1999, Spartan Stores began to acquire retail supermarkets in its focused geographic regions. In August 2000, Spartan Stores common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol &#8220;SPTN.&#8221; On November 19, 2013, Spartan Stores merged with Nash-Finch Company (&#8220;Nash-Finch&#8221;). Nash-Finch&#8217;s core businesses include distributing food to military commissaries and independent grocery retailers and distributing to and operating corporate-owned retail stores. Following completion of the merger, the combined company is named SpartanNash Company. Unless the context otherwise requires, the use of the terms &#8220;SpartanNash,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to the surviving corporation SpartanNash Company and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. 

The Company&#8217;s hybrid business model supports the close functioning of its Military, Food Distribution, and Retail operations, optimizing the natural complements of each business segment while also enhancing the ability of the Company&#8217;s independent retailers to compete long term in the grocery industry. The model produces operational efficiencies, helps stimulate distribution product demand, and provides sharper visibility and broader business growth options. In addition, the Military, Food Distribution, and Retail diversification provides added flexibility to pursue the best long-term growth opportunities in each segment. 

SpartanNash has established key management priorities for the longer-term strategy of the Company, including establishing a well-differentiated product offering for its Military, Food Distribution, and Retail segments, and additional strategies designed to create value for its shareholders, retailers and customers. These priorities are:

Military Segment 

The Company&#8217;s Military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products primarily to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges.

The distributed grocery products are delivered to 169 military commissaries and over 442 exchanges located in 37 states across the United States and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Bahrain and Egypt. The Company&#8217;s distribution centers are strategically located among the largest concentration of military bases in the areas the Company serves and near Atlantic ports used to ship grocery products to overseas commissaries and exchanges. The Company&#8217;s Military segment has an outstanding reputation as a distributor focused on U.S. military commissaries and exchanges, based in large measure on its excellent service metrics, which include fill rate, on-time delivery and shipping accuracy.

The Defense Commissary Agency (&#8220;DeCA&#8221;) operates a chain of commissaries on U.S. military installations throughout the world. DeCA contracts with manufacturers to obtain grocery and related products for the commissary system. Manufacturers either deliver the products to the commissaries themselves or, more commonly, contract with distributors such as SpartanNash to deliver the products. Manufacturers must authorize the distributors as their official representatives to DeCA, and the distributors must adhere to DeCA&#8217;s frequent delivery system procedures governing matters such as product identification, ordering and processing, information exchange and resolution of discrepancies. The Company obtains distribution contracts with manufacturers through competitive bidding processes and direct negotiations. 

The Company has approximately 250 distribution contracts representing 600 manufacturers that supply products to the DeCA commissary system and various exchange systems. The larger contracts have definitive durations whereas the smaller contracts generally have an indefinite term, but may be terminated by either party without cause upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. The contracts typically specify the commissaries and exchanges to supply on behalf of the manufacturer, the manufacturer&#8217;s products to be supplied, service and delivery requirements and pricing and payment terms . The Company&#8217;s ten largest manufacturer customers represented approximately 40% of the Company&#8217;s Military segment sales for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. 

As commissaries need to be restocked, DeCA identifies the manufacturer with which an order is to be placed, determines which distributor is the manufacturer&#8217;s official representative for a particular commissary or exchange location, and then places a product order with that distributor under the auspices of DeCA&#8217;s master contract with the applicable manufacturer. The distributor selects that product from its existing inventory, delivers it to the commissary or commissaries designated by DeCA, and bills the manufacturer for the product shipped. The manufacturer then bills DeCA under the terms of its master contract. Overseas commissaries are serviced in a similar fashion, except that a distributor&#8217;s responsibility is to deliver products as and when needed to the port designated by DeCA, which in turn bears the responsibility for shipping the product to the applicable commissary or overseas warehouse. 

After the Company ships a particular manufacturer&#8217;s products to commissaries in response to an order from DeCA, the Company invoices the manufacturer for the product price plus a service and/or drayage fee that is typically based on a percentage of the purchase price, but may in some cases be based on a dollar amount per case or pound of product sold. The Company&#8217;s order handling and invoicing activities are facilitated by procurement and billing systems developed specifically for the Military business, which addresses the unique aspects of its business, and provides the Company&#8217;s manufacturer customers with a web-based, interactive means of accessing critical order, inventory and delivery information. 

Food Distribution Segment 

The Company&#8217;s Food Distribution segment uses a multi-platform sales approach to distribute grocery products to independent retail locations and corporate-owned retail stores. Total net sales from the Company&#8217;s Food Distribution segment, including sales to corporate-owned retail stores that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, were approximately $4.3 billion for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. As of the end of fiscal 2015, the Company believes that it is the fifth largest wholesale distributor, by revenue, to supermarkets in the United States. 

Customers. The Company&#8217;s Food Distribution segment supplies grocery products to a diverse group of independent grocery store operators ranging from a single store to supermarket chains with over 20 stores; and also supplies the Company&#8217;s corporate-owned retail stores. The Company operates in 47 states with 12 distribution centers supporting approximately 2,100 independently owned supermarkets and also supplies its 163 corporate-owned retail stores. This larger geographic reach allows for increased scale as the Company leverages the organization to enhance the ability of its independent retailers to compete long-term in the grocery industry. 

- 4- 

The Company services a national retailer, Dollar Gene ral, through its Food Distribution segment. Sales are made to more than 13,000 retail locations for this customer, representing 10.7% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015. Sales to this customer did not exceed 10% of consolidated net sales for any othe r year presented. The Company&#8217;s Food Distribution customer base is diverse, and no other single customer exceeded 5% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented. 

The Company&#8217;s five largest Food Distribution customers (excluding corporate-owned retail stores) accounted for approximately 39% of total Food Distribution net sales for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. In addition, approximately 84% of Food Distribution net sales, including intercompany sales to corporate-owned retail stores, are covered under supply agreements with independent customers or are directly controlled by SpartanNash. 

Products. The Company&#8217;s Food Distribution segment provides a selection of approximately 56,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) of nationally branded and private label grocery products (see &#8220;Marketing and Merchandising &#8211; Private Brands&#8221;) and perishable food products, including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty care products and pharmacy. These product offerings, along with best in class services, allow independent retailers the opportunity to support their entire operations with a single supplier. Meeting consumers&#8217; needs will continue to be SpartanNash&#8217;s mission as it executes its hybrid business model of wholesale, retail and military supply.

Retail Segment 

The Company&#8217;s neighborhood market strategy distinguishes its corporate-owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores by emphasizing convenient locations, demographically-targeted merchandise selections, high-quality fresh offerings, customer service, value pricing and community involvement. 

The Company&#8217;s Retail segment operates 163 corporate-owned retail stores in the Midwest and Great Lakes which operate primarily under the banners of Family Fare Supermarkets, Family Fresh Markets, D&#38;W Fresh Markets, and Sun Mart . Retail banners and numbers of stores are more fully detailed in Item 2, &#8220;Properties,&#8221; of this report.

The Company&#8217;s corporate-owned retail stores offer nationally branded and private label grocery products (see &#8220;Marketing and Merchandising &#8211; Private Brands&#8221;) and perishable food products including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products and health and beauty care products. The private label grocery products provide enhanced retail margins and are believed to help improve customer loyalty. The Company also offers pharmacy services in 91 of its corporate-owned retail stores. The Company&#8217;s corporate-owned retail stores range in size from approximately 10,400 to 92,381 total square feet, or on average, approximately 41,300 total square feet per store.

The Company operates 29 fuel centers primarily at its supermarket locations operating under the banners Family Fare Quick Stop , D&#38;W Quick Stop , VG&#8217;s Quick Stop, Forest Hills Quick Stop and Sun Mart Express Fuel . These fuel centers offer refueling facilities and in the adjacent convenience store, a limited variety of popular consumable products. The Company&#8217;s prototypical Quick Stop stores are approximately 1,100 square feet in size. The Company has experienced increased supermarket sales upon opening fuel centers and initiating cross-merchandising activities. The Company plans, as opportunities arise, to open additional fuel centers at certain of its supermarket locations over the next few years. 

- 5- 

The Company&#8217;s corporate-owned retail stores are primarily the result of acquisitions from January 1999 to June 2015, including the merger with Nash-Finch in November 20 13. The following chart details the changes in the number of corporate-owned retail stores over the last five fiscal years, including the transition year ended December 28, 2013:

During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the Company opened one new retail store in Dickinson, North Dakota, acquired six stores in Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota, completed seven major remodels, and completed many other limited remodels. The Company also converted six corporate-owned retail stores to the Family Fare banner. 

&#160;

The Company expects to continue making progress with its capital investment program during fiscal 2016 by completing 13 major remodels, and by opening additional fuel centers or entering into partnerships with existing fuel operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its store base and may close three or four stores during the course of 2016. The Company evaluates proposed projects based on demographics and competition within each geographic area, and prioritizes projects based on their expected returns on investment. Approval of proposed capital projects requires a projected internal rate of return that meets or exceeds the Company&#8217;s policy; however, the Company may undertake projects that do not meet this standard to the extent they represent required maintenance or necessary infrastructure improvements. In addition, the Company performs a post completion review of financial results versus its expectation on all major projects. The Company believes that focusing on such measures provides it with an appropriate level of discipline in its capital expenditures process.

Supply Chain Network

The Company has integrated its supply chain organization to further optimize the network, increase asset utilization and leverage programs that will drive more value for its shareholders, retailers and customers. The Company believes its distribution facilities are strategically located to efficiently serve current customers and also have the available capacity to support future growth. The Company continually evaluates inventory movement and assigns SKUs to appropriate areas within its distribution facilities to reduce the time required to stock and pick products and to achieve additional efficiencies.

The Company has several projects planned for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. These projects are designed to further integrate the Company&#8217;s supply chain capabilities across distribution centers and thereby increase efficiency of both inbound and outbound distribution operations. To demonstrate the Company&#8217;s commitment across the entire network, the Company has invested in uniformly branding all tractors with a new logo that embodies the Company&#8217;s tagline, &#8220; Taking Food Places. &#8221; Newly purchased trailers will also receive the new logo layout. Over the next two years, the Company plans to re-logo all existing trailers within the SpartanNash supply chain. This will allow the Company to increase asset utilization by sharing resources across all facility locations.

Supply Chain Functions . The Company&#8217;s distribution network is comprised of 19 distribution centers, 7 of which primarily service the Military segment and 12 of which service the Food Distribution segment, with approximately 9.1 million total square feet of warehouse space. 

The Company operates a fleet of approximately 490 over-the-road tractors, 575 dry vans, and 960 refrigerated trailers. Through routing optimization systems, the Company carefully manages the millions of miles its fleet drives annually servicing its military commissaries, exchanges, independent retailers, national account locations and corporate-owned supermarkets. The Company has also equipped some of its refrigerated trailers with a refrigeration unit that has the capability to run on electric standby, offering an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel fuel. The Company remains committed to the ongoing investment required to maintain a best in class fleet while focusing on low cost, environmentally friendly solutions.

Products 

The Company offers a wide variety of grocery products, general merchandise and health and beauty care, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services. The consolidated net sales include the net sales of its Military segment, corporate-owned stores and fuel centers in its Retail segment and the net sales of its Food Distribution business, which excludes sales to affiliated stores.

Reporting Segment Financial Data 

More detailed information about the Company&#8217;s reporting segments can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, which is herein incorporated by reference. All of the Company&#8217;s sales and assets are in the United States of America. 

Discontinued Operations 

Certain of the Company&#8217;s Retail and Food Distribution operations have been recorded as discontinued operations. Discontinued operations consist of certain locations that have been closed or sold. Additional information may be found in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, which is herein incorporated by reference. 

Marketing and Merchandising 

General. The Company continues to align its marketing and merchandising strategies with current consumer behaviors by delivering initiatives centered on personalization, a multi-channel experience, value beyond price, and health and wellness. These strategies seek to use consumer data and insights to deliver products, promotions, content and experiences to satisfy the consumer&#8217;s needs. 

The Company believes that its &#8220;yes Rewards&#8221; loyalty program gives it competitive insight into consumer behavior. This gives the Company the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing conditions by making tactical and more effective adjustments to its marketing and merchandising programs. In fiscal 2015, the Company expanded its yes Rewards program to certain Family Fare and Family Fresh Markets stores in the western geographic areas and also provided a digital coupon program to its independent retailers. 

The Company&#8217;s investment to further strengthen its knowledge of the consumer has resulted in progress in several areas: robust self-serve data tool that enables it to make consumer centric merchandising and marketing decisions; the development of a customer strategy that will be used to guide its internal business processes and go-to market strategy; and the evolution of its customer segmentation that takes it beyond the purchase and transactional behavior to lifestyle. These accomplishments are building blocks and will ultimately enable the Company to provide a shopping experience that better meets the changing needs of the consumer. 

Through its numerous strategic partnerships, the Company is able to develop its enterprise approach to customer centricity; benefiting both its Retail and Food Distribution businesses. By harnessing its proprietary data, the Company is able to provide a set of tools and capabilities for the organization that enables the Company to provide its customers with a more relevant and personalized shopping experience. This effort also enables the Company to continue to learn more about its best customers; develop strategies to enable long-term customer and supplier loyalty; deploy a more effective and efficient marketing spend; and ultimately make better business decisions. 

The Company has been building tools and capabilities to enable relevant, personalized content across its marketing channels and focusing on expanding its digital, social and mobile capabilities. The Company also implemented a number of capabilities that enables it to more effectively target consumers and more efficiently develop and execute campaigns. This will help the Company to further build longer-term customer loyalty, maintain efficient marketing spend and increase return on investment, improve its sales growth opportunities, and further strengthen its business position. As the Company continues to build these capabilities, along with its other strategies, the Company will continue to share its marketing and merchandising learnings and best practices across its wholesale customer base. 

- 7- 

The Company also believes it can differentiate itself from its competitors by offering a full set of services, from value added services in its Food Distribution segment to the inc lusion of fuel centers and Starbucks Coffee or Caribou Coffee shops in some of its corporate-owned retail stores. The Company also provides consumers with discounts on fuel purchases at its fuel centers. In 2015, the Company began offering fuel programs in the western geographic areas by partnering with third party fuel centers. In addition, the Company also refined its fuel promotions and executed several pilots to further enhance its program and provide value to the customer. 

The Company offers pharmacy services in 91 of its supermarkets and operates three free-standing pharmacy locations. The Company believes the pharmacy service offering in its supermarkets is an important part of the consumer experience. In its Michigan pharmacies, the Company offers free medications (antibiotics, diabetic medications and pre-natal vitamins) along with generic drugs for $4 and $10, and food solutions for preventative health and education for its customers. The Company has recently expanded these programs to a number of corporate-owned retail stores that have pharmacies in Minnesota and Nebraska.

As consumers increasingly emphasize health and wellness, the Company believes that it can be a provider and resource for products and services that will support their needs. In 2015, the Company continued to expand its offerings and partnerships and undertook the following key initiatives. First, the Company continued to expand its &#8220;Living Well&#8221; concept through store-within-a-store concepts and expanded product offerings. Second, the Company established partnerships with health systems and providers to provide dietician-led store tours to help educate consumers to make healthier food choices. Third, the Company increased its retail product offering and assortment for gluten-free, meat-free, non-GMO products and other health and wellness options. The Company is also proud to work with local farmers and vendors to provide locally grown produce and products in many stores. 

Private Brands. SpartanNash currently markets and distributes over 7,100 total private brand items primarily under the following labels: Spartan and Our Family ; Top Care (health and beauty care); Tippy Toes (baby); Full Circle (organic and wellness); B-leve (premium bath and beauty); PAWS Premium (pet supplies); and Valu Tim e (value) . The Company believes that its private brand offerings are part of its most valuable strategic assets, demonstrated through customer loyalty and profitability. 

The Company has worked to develop a best in class private brand program. The Company has added more than 1,000 total corporate brand products to its consumer offerings in the past year, and as a result of realigning its private brand program to reduce the number of duplicative product offerings, the Company plans to introduce approximately 500 new total items in fiscal 2016 to round out its portfolio. The Company&#8217;s products have been frequently recognized for excellence in packaging design and product development. These awards underscore the Company&#8217;s continued commitment to providing the consumer with quality products at exceptional value. The Company&#8217;s focus is and will continue to be the pursuit of new opportunities and expansion of private brand offerings to its customers.

Competition 

The Company&#8217;s Military, Food Distribution and Retail segments operate in highly competitive geographic areas, which typically result in low profit margins for the industry as a whole. The Company competes with, among others, regional and national grocery distributors, large chain stores that have integrated wholesale and retail operations, mass merchandisers, e-commerce providers, limited assortment stores and wholesale membership clubs, many of whom have greater resources than the Company. 

The Company is one of five distributors in the United States with annual sales to the DeCA commissary system in excess of $100 million that distributes products via the frequent delivery system. The remaining distributors that supply DeCA tend to be smaller, regional and local providers. In addition, manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products, such as baking supplies, produce, deli items, soft drinks and snack items, directly to DeCA commissaries and service exchanges. Because of the narrow margins in this industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale, which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic area(s) a distributor serves. As a result, no single distributor in this industry, by itself, has a nationwide presence. Rather, distributors tend to concentrate on specific regions, or areas within specific regions, where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently. In addition, distributors that operate larger non-military specific distribution businesses tend to compete for DeCA commissary business in areas where such business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing distribution centers.
