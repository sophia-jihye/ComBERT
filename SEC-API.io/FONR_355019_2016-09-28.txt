 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

Fonar Corporation, sometimes referred to as the &#34;Company&#34; or &#34;Fonar&#34;, is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated on July 17, 1978. Our address is 110 Marcus Drive, Melville, New York 11747 and our telephone number is 631-694-2929. Fonar also maintains a website at www.fonar.com. Fonar provides copies of its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and amendments to these reports to stockholders on request. 

&#160; 

We conduct our business in two segments. Our medical equipment segment is conducted directly through Fonar. Our physician management and diagnostic services segment is conducted through our subsidiary Health Management Company of America (&#8220;HMCA&#8221;), also called Health Diagnostics Management, LLC. HMCA provides management services, administrative services, billing and collection services, office space, equipment, repair, maintenance service, and clerical and other non-medical personnel to medical providers engaged in diagnostic imaging. In addition to acting as a management company, HMCA owns and operates four diagnostic imaging facilities in Florida, where the corporate practice of medicine is permitted. 

&#160; 

We restructured the corporate organization of our physician and diagnostic services management segment of our business effective July 1, 2015. Imperial Management Services, LLC (&#8220;Imperial&#8221;), a subsidiary which owned the assets used in the business of its parent, Health Management Corporation of America (which is wholly-owned by Fonar), transferred those assets to Health Diagnostics Management, LLC (&#8220;HDM&#8221;), which is another subsidiary of Health Management Corporation of America. As a result, going forward our physician and diagnostic management business will be conducted entirely through HDM, which is operating under the assumed name Health Management Company of America. 

&#160; 

Fonar is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing magnetic resonance imaging scanners, also referred to as &#34;MRI&#34; or &#34;MR&#34; scanners, which utilize MRI technology for the detection and diagnosis of human disease, abnormalities, other medical conditions and injuries. Fonar&#8217;s founders built the first MRI scanner in 1977 and Fonar introduced the first commercial MRI scanner in 1980. Fonar is also the originator of the iron-core non-superconductive and permanent magnet technology. 

&#160; 

Fonar&#8217;s iron frame technology made Fonar the originator of &#34;open&#34; MRI scanners. We introduced the first &#34;open&#34; MRI in 1980. Since that time we have concentrated on further application of our &#8220;open&#8221; MRI, introducing most recently the Upright&#174; Multi-Position&#8482;&#8221; MRI scanner (also referred to as the &#8220;Upright&#174;&#8221; or &#8220;Stand-Up&#174;&#8221; MRI scanner) and the Fonar 360&#8482; MRI scanner. (The Fonar 360&#8482; MRI is not presently being marketed). 

&#160; 

The product we are promoting is our Upright&#174; MRI. Our patented Upright&#174; MRI is unique in the industry in that it allows patients to be scanned in fully weight-bearing conditions, such as standing, sitting or bending in any position that causes adverse symptoms. This means that an abnormality or injury, such as a slipped disk can be visualized where it may not have been seen with the patient lying down. We have introduced the name &#8220;Upright&#174;&#8221; as an alternative to &#8220;Stand-Up&#174;&#8221; because of the multiplicity of positions in which the patient may be scanned where the patient is not standing. 

&#160;

THE UPRIGHT&#174; MRI SCANNER 

&#160; 

The Upright&#174; MRI (also known as the &#8220;Stand-Up&#174; MRI&#8221;) is a &#8220;whole-body&#8221; MRI, meaning it can be used to scan any part of the body. Unlike conventional recumbent MRI scanners, the Upright&#174; MRI permits MRI diagnoses to be made in the weight-bearing state. The Upright&#174; MRI allows patients to be scanned while standing, sitting, bending or lying down. This means that an abnormality or injury, such as a slipped disk, may be scanned under full weight-bearing conditions, which more often than not is the position in which patients experience pain. An adjustable bed allows patients to stand, sit or lie on their backs, sides or stomachs. The Upright&#174; MRI is by design a non-claustrophobic MRI scanner. 

&#160; 

HMCA manages a total of 25 MRI scanning facilities, four of which are owned by subsidiaries of HMCA. Eighteen facilities are located in New York and seven are located in Florida. (The four facilities owned by HMCA subsidiaries are in Florida, where the corporate practice of medicine is permitted.) Twenty-four facilities are equipped with Upright&#174; MRI scanners. We believe that the utilization of Fonar Upright&#174; MRI scanning systems, which are produced under the protection of our patents, have been a significant factor in the increased patient volume of the scanning facilities. 

&#160; 

MEDICAL EQUIPMENT SEGMENT 

&#160; 

PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

The Fonar Upright&#174; MRI is a weight-bearing whole-body open MRI system which enables positional MRI (pMRI&#174;) applications. Operating at a magnetic field strength of 0.6 Tesla, the scanner is a powerful, diagnostically versatile and cost-effective open MRI that provides a broad range of clinical capabilities and a complete set of imaging protocols. Patients can be scanned standing, bending, sitting, upright at an intermediate angle and in the conventional recumbent position. This multi-positional MRI system accommodates an unrestricted range of motion for flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation studies of the cervical (upper)and lumbar (lower) spine. Previously difficult patient scanning positions can be achieved and compared using the system&#8217;s MRI-compatible, three-dimensional, motorized patient handling system. The system&#8217;s lift and tilt functions deliver the targeted anatomical region to the center of the magnet. True image orientation is assured, regardless of the rotation angle, via computer read-back of the table&#8217;s position. 

&#160; 

There is considerable evidence that the weight-bearing Upright&#174; MRI provides medical benefits not duplicated by any other MRI scanner because patient positioning plays a critical role in detecting clinically significant pathology.

&#160; 

For instance, the Fonar Upright&#174; technology has demonstrated its key value on patients with the Arnold-Chiari Syndrome, which is believed to affect 200,000 to 500,000 Americans. In this syndrome, brain stem compression and subsequent severe neurological symptoms occur in these patients, when because of weakness in the support tissues within the skull, the brain stem descends and is compressed and entrapped at the base of the skull in the foramen magnum, which is the circular bony opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord exits the skull. The brain structures &#8220;entrapped&#8221; in Chiari Syndrome are the lowest lying structures of the brain, the tonsils of the cerebellum. The Chiari Syndrome is therefore alternately named Cerebellar Tonsillar Ectopia (CTE) indicating the displacement (ectopia) of these Cerebellar tonsils in this syndrome. Classic symptoms of the Chiari Syndrome include the &#8220;drop attack,&#8221; where the patient unexpectedly experiences an explosive rush or nervous discharge at the base of the brain which rushes down the body to the extremities, causing the patient to collapse in a temporary neuromuscular paralysis; this subsides when the patient is lying down. Conventional lie-down MRI scanners cannot make an adequate evaluation of the pathology since the patient&#8217;s pathology is most visible and the symptoms most acute when the patient is scanned in the upright weight-bearing position. 

&#160; 

A publication in the Journal &#8220;Brain Injury&#8221; (Brain Injury 2010, 24 (7-8) 988-994) of 1,200 neck pain patients reported that the fallen cerebellar tonsils of the brain (CTE) were missed 75% of the time when the patient was scanned only in the recumbent position. It is critical to have an image of the patient in an upright position so that the neurosurgeons can fully evaluate the extent of the brain stem and choose the most appropriate surgical approach for the operative repair. 

&#160; 

The study was published by 10 authors from distinguished universities in the United States and around the world. The study reported that Cerebellar Tonsillar Ectopia Herniation (CTE) was missed 75% of the time when the patient was scanned lying down instead of upright. At the current rate of 1,000,000 automobile whiplash injuries in the U.S. per year, 600,000 patients each year would have the pathology responsible for their symptoms go undetected if they were examined solely in a conventional recumbent-only MRI. 

&#160; 

The Upright&#174; MRI has also demonstrated its value for patients suffering from scoliosis. Scoliosis patients have been typically subjected to routine x-ray exams for years and must be imaged upright for an adequate evaluation of their scoliosis. Because the patient must be standing for the exam, an x-ray machine has been the only modality that could provide that service. The Upright&#174; MRI is the only MRI scanner that allows the patient to stand during the MRI exam. Fonar has developed a new RF receiver and scanning protocol that for the first time allows scoliosis patients to obtain diagnostic pictures of their spines without the risks of x-rays. A study by the National Cancer Institute (2000)of 5,466 women with scoliosis reported a 70% increase in breast cancer resulting from 24.7 chest x-rays these patients received on the average in the course of their scoliosis treatment. 

&#160; 

Other important new applications are Upright&#174; imaging of the pelvic floor and abdomen to image prolapses and inguinal hernias. Fonar has also developed the first non-invasive method to image the prostate: the patient simply sits on a flat, seat-like coil. 

&#160; 

The Upright&#174; MRI is also the world&#8217;s most non-claustrophobic whole-body MRI scanner. Patients can simply walk into the magnet, stand or sit for their scans and then walk out. Any site with a Fonar Upright&#174; MRI scanner is capable of providing Open Sky&#174; MRI scanning services. The magnet&#8217;s front-open and top-open design provides an unprecedented degree of comfort because there is nothing in front of the patient&#8217;s face except for a large (42&#8221;) flat-screen TV that is mounted on the wall. The default position for the bed is a tilt back of seven degrees that minimizes patient motion. Special coil fixtures, a patient seat, Velcro straps, and transpolar stabilizing bars are also used to keep the patient comfortable and motionless throughout the scanning process. 

&#160; 

Full-range-of-motion studies of the joints in a multiple of directions are possible, an especially promising feature for sports injuries. Full Range of Motion cines, or movies, of the lumbar spine can also be achieved under full body weight.

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

The Upright&#174; MRI is designed to maximize image quality through an optimal combination of signal-to-noise (S/N) and contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratios. The technical improvements realized in this scanner&#8217;s design over its lower field strength predecessors also include increased image-processing speed and diagnostic flexibility. 

&#160; 

Fonar created the high-field open MRI market segment. High-field open MRIs operate at significantly higher magnetic field strengths than the 0.2-0.35 Tesla open MRIs that preceded them, and, therefore, benefit from more of the MRI image-producing signal needed to make high-quality MRI images. 

&#160; 

Fonar maximizes image quality through an optimal combination of image signal to noise (S/N) and contrast-to noise (C/N) ratios. Technical improvements incorporated into the scanner design include increased image processing speed, high-S/N Organ Specific(TM) RF receiver coils, high performance front-end electronics featuring high-speed, wide-dynamic-range analog-to-digital conversion and a miniaturized ultra-low-noise pre-amplifier; high-speed automatic tuning, bandwidth-optimized pulse sequences, multi-bandwidth sequences, and off-center FOV imaging capability. 

&#160; 

In addition to the signal-to-noise ratio, however, a major determinant of image quality that must be considered is contrast, the quality that enables reading physicians to clearly distinguish adjacent, and sometimes minute, anatomical structures from their surroundings. This quality is measured by contrast-to-noise ratios (C/N). Unlike S/N, which increases with increasing field strength, relaxometry studies have shown that C/N peaks in the mid-field range and actually falls off precipitously at higher field strengths. The Upright&#174; MRI scanners operate squarely in the optimum C/N range. 

&#160; 

FONAR&#8217;s scanners provide various features allowing for versatile diagnostic capability. For example, SMART&#8482; scanning allows for same-scan customization of up to 63 slices, each slice with its own thickness, resolution, angle and position. This is an important feature for scanning parts of the body that include small-structure sub-regions requiring finer slice parameters. There is also Multi-Angle Oblique&#8482; (MAO) imaging, and oblique imaging. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, sales of our Upright&#174; MRI scanners accounted for approximately 1.1% of our total revenues and 7.7% of our medical equipment revenues, as compared to 2.3% of total revenues and 14.1% of medical equipment revenues in fiscal 2015, and as compared to 1.4% of our total revenues and 7.9% of medical equipment revenues in fiscal 2014. These results reflect the volatility in our sales of scanners. 

&#160; 

FONAR&#8217;s principal selling, marketing and advertising efforts have been focused on the Upright&#174; MRI, which we believe is a particularly unique product, being the only MRI scanner which is both open and allows for weight-bearing imaging. We expect to continue our focus on the Upright&#174; MRI in the immediate future. 

&#160; 

The materials and components used in the manufacture of our products (circuit boards, computer hardware components, electrical components, steel and plastic) are generally available at competitive prices. We have not had difficulty acquiring such materials. 

&#160; 

PRODUCT MARKETING 

&#160; 

The principal markets for the Company's scanners are private diagnostic imaging centers and hospitals. 

&#160; 

We use internal and independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives for domestic and foreign markets. None of Fonar&#8217;s competitors are entitled to make the Fonar Upright&#174; MRI scanner. 

&#160; 

Fonar&#8217;s Website includes interactive product information for reaching customers. 

&#160; 

Fonar has targeted orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, particularly spine surgeons, as important markets for the Upright&#174; MRI. Accordingly, Fonar has exhibited at annual meetings of The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS); the North American Spine Society (NASS); the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS); and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS).

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, sales were made to customers in the [United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, Canada and to Medserena in Germany.] CEO Matthias Schulz of Medserena, Fonar&#8217;s principal foreign sales representative and distributor, has said, &#8220;The large number of requests coming from our physicians in Germany are arising because of the special medical need for FONAR&#8217;s unique technology. This is in spite of an intensely active MRI market in Germany, where there are already many conventional lie-down MRIs installed.&#8221; [Medserena also has expanded its market to the United Kingdom with the opening of a Fonar Upright&#174; MRI scanner in London.] 

&#160; 

Fonar&#8217;s marketing strategy has been designed to reach key purchasing decision makers with information concerning the Upright&#174; MRI. This has led to many inquiries and to some sales of the Upright&#174; MRI scanner and is intended to increase Fonar&#8217;s presence in the medical market. Fonar focuses on four target audiences: neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists and physicians in general. 

&#160; 

1) Neurosurgeons and Orthopaedic Surgeons: These are the surgeons who can most benefit from the superior diagnostic benefits of the Fonar Upright&#174; MRI with its Multi-Position&#174; diagnostic ability. 

2) Radiologists: These physicians can now offer a new modality to their referring physicians. 

3) All Physicians: The vast number of doctors who send patients for MRI&#8217;s need to be aware of the diagnostic advantages of the Fonar Upright&#174; Multi-Position&#174; MRI. 

&#160; 

Our advertising for Fonar and HMCA re-enforces the unique value provided by Fonar MRI scanners. We have increased internet awareness of our product by driving patient traffic to the Upright&#174; scanning centers we manage via the Fonar website (www.fonar.com) as well as by creating Websites for every location. These websites give prospective customers of Upright&#174; MRI scanners a view of operating Upright&#174; MRI centers and highlight the benefits of using an Upright&#174; MRI scanner. The success of HMCA-managed sites not only increases management fees to HMCA but encourages new sales for Fonar as well. 

&#160; 

To meet the demand for high-field open MRI scanners, Fonar plans to devote its principal efforts to marketing the Upright&#174; MRI. The Upright&#174; MRI is the only scanner in the industry that has the unique capability of scanning patients under weight-bearing conditions and in various positions. Utilizing a 6000 gauss (0.6 Tesla field strength) iron core electromagnet, the Upright&#174; MRI scanner magnets are among the highest field &#34;Open MRI&#34; scanners in the industry. 

&#160; 

We are seeking to promote foreign sales and have sold scanners in various foreign countries. Foreign sales, however, have not yet proved to be a significant source of revenue. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, 1.1% of the Company's revenues were generated by foreign sales, as compared to 3.0% for fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

SERVICE AND UPGRADES FOR MRI SCANNERS 

&#160; 

Our customer base of installed scanners has been and will continue to be an additional source of income, independent of direct sales. 

&#160; 

Income is generated from the installed base in two principal areas, namely, service and upgrades. Service and maintenance revenues from our external installed base were approximately $9.5 million in fiscal 2016 and $9.7 million in fiscal 2015. Notwithstanding the decrease in service revenues in fiscal 2016, our objective is to maintain service revenues at present levels or better, based on the longevity of the technology and refurbishments and upgrades which keep the scanners competitive with the latest techniques. 

&#160; 

We also anticipate that our scanners will result in upgrades income in future fiscal years. The potential for upgrades income, originates in the versatility and productivity of the Upright&#174; Imaging technology. New medical uses for MRI technology are constantly being discovered and are anticipated for the Upright&#174; Imaging technology as well. New features can often be added to the scanner by the implementation of little more than versatile new software packages, which when coupled with hardware upgrades can add years of useful life to the scanner.

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we incurred expenditures of $1,631,846, none of which were capitalized, on research and development, as compared to $1,812,398, none of which were capitalized, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. 

&#160; 

Research and development activities have focused principally on software improvements to the user interface of the MRI scanner. The Windows-based Sympulse&#8482; platform controls all of the functions of the UPRIGHT&#174; scanner except those of the versatile, multi-position patient table. Separate, dedicated, motion-control software is used to maneuver the UPRIGHT&#174; bed, and development of this software is ongoing as well. 

&#160; 

While software improvements to the user interface are important in their own right, significant value is added to the MRI scanner by the modification of existing protocols for examining various parts of the body, and the development of new protocols that utilize new underlying capabilities of the pulse sequence software. Over time, FONAR users have become accustomed to the steady improvement in the recommended clinical protocols that accompany new software releases. More significantly, in recent years we have seen increasing adoption of FONAR-recommended clinical protocols over those developed on site. This is a testament to the superior image quality they produce in attractively short scan times. 

&#160; 

The development of clinically practical scan protocols and software depends on close contact between research and development scientists and engineers, and end users. That close contact is facilitated in part by the relationship with HMCA and the scanning centers. In addition to that collaboration, R&#38;D staff have pursued a variety of novel and Upright&#174; MRI-specific research projects. It is anticipated that these will ultimately lead to new applications that are made available to existing customers as upgrade add-ons to their machines. For example, phase-contrast imaging techniques originally developed for angiography have recently been applied to cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) flow. Analysis of CSF flow in upright and recumbent postures may prove to be of significant value in the evaluation of a variety of disorders. 

&#160; 

BACKLOG 

&#160; 

Our backlog of unfilled orders at September 9, 2016 was approximately $1.7 million, as compared to $2.5 million at September 10, 2015. It is expected that the existing backlog of orders will be filled within the 2017 fiscal year. 

&#160; 

PATENTS AND LICENSES 

&#160; 

We currently have numerous patents in effect which relate to the technology and components of our MRI scanners. We believe that these patents, and the know-how we have developed, are material to our business. 

&#160; 

One of our patents, issued in the name of Dr. Damadian and licensed to Fonar, was United States patent No. 3,789,832, Apparatus and Method for Detecting Cancer in Tissue, also referred to in this report as the &#34;1974 Patent&#34;. The 1974 Patent was the first MRI patent issued by the United States Patent Office. The development of our MRI scanners has been based upon the 1974 Patent, and we believe that the 1974 Patent was the first of its kind to utilize MR to scan the human body and to detect cancer. The 1974 Patent was extended beyond its original 17-year term and expired in February, 1992. 

&#160; 

We have significantly enhanced our patent position within the industry and now possesses a substantial patent portfolio which provides us, under the aegis of United States patent law, &#34;the exclusive right to make, use and sell&#34; many of the scanner features which Fonar pioneered and which are now incorporated in most MRI scanners sold by the industry. As of June 30, 2016, 195 patents had been issued to Fonar, and approximately 21 patents were pending. A number of Fonar&#8217;s existing patents specifically relate to protecting Fonar&#8217;s position in the Upright MRI market. The patents further enhance Dr. Damadian's pioneer patent, the 1974 Patent, that initiated the MRI industry and provided the original invention of MRI scanning. The terms of the patents in Fonar&#8217;s portfolio extend to various times.

PRODUCT COMPETITION

MRI SCANNERS 

&#160; 

MRI takes advantage of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal elicited from the body's tissues and the exceptional sensitivity of this signal for detecting disease discovered by Fonar. Much of the serious disease of the body occurs in the soft tissue of vital organs. The maximum contrast available by x-ray with which to discriminate disease is 4%. Brain cancers differ from surrounding healthy brain by only 1.6% while the contrast in the brain by MRI is 25 times greater at 40%. X-ray contrasts among the body&#8217;s soft tissues are maximally 4%. Their contrast by MRI is 32.5 times greater (130%). 

&#160; 

The soft tissue contrasts with which to distinguish cancers on images by MRI are up to 180%. In the case of cancer these contrasts can be even more marked making cancers readily visible and detectable anywhere in the body. This is because the nuclear resonance signals from the body's normal soft tissue vital organs, as discovered in the original publication that founded MRI, differ so dramatically from each other (e.g. small intestine 257 milliseconds, brain 595 milliseconds). Liver cancer and healthy liver signals differ by 180% for example. 

&#160; 

A majority of the MRI scanners in use in hospitals and outpatient facilities and at mobile sites in the United States are based on high field (1.5 - 3.0 Tesla) air core superconducting magnet technology. 

&#160; 

The remainder, described as Open MRIs, are recumbent-only machines based on Fonar&#8217;s original iron-frame vertical magnetic field magnet design. These systems have been manufactured and sold by many of our largest competitors over the years. They generally operate at low field strengths (0.2 - 0.35 Tesla). Recently our competitors have attempted to introduce higher field strength Open MRI products (0.5 &#8211; 1.0 Tesla), but the perception of the medical community is still that Open MRIs are useful only for anxious and claustrophobic patients, and that the Open MRIs&#8217; image quality is poor, and scan times long. 

&#160; 

One of the Upright MRI&#8217;s big competitive advantages is that it is dramatically different from the Open MRI in several important ways: 

&#160; 

The Upright MRI does something clinically valuable that the high-field MRI machines cannot do (i.e. positional imaging, weight-bearing imaging). 

&#160; 

Although the patient can extend his arms and possibly see out the sides while recumbent in an Open MRI, there is still a large intimidating magnet pole very close to and directly in front of the patient&#8217;s face. The Upright MRI allows the patient to look directly out of the scanner and watch a 42 inch TV. 

&#160; 

The Upright MRI uses the same configuration RF receiver coil as a high-field MRI system to image the spine. Open MRIs cannot do this. (This is because of the rule in MRI that the axis of symmetry of the RF receiver coil should be perpendicular to the direction of the main magnetic field. The upright patient sits comfortably with his back against a flat (&#8220;planar&#8221;) RF receiver coil in our horizontal transaxial magnetic field. In contrast, the vertical magnetic field in the recumbent-only Open MRI precludes the use of this type of receiver coil). 

&#160; 

Relative to the high-field systems, the Upright MRI has two major competitive advantages: 

&#160; 

Patient positioning sometimes trumps a small increase in the image resolution and decrease in the scan time. As it is critical for physicians to not &#8220;miss&#8221; anything in the images, they recognize that the position-dependent pathology visualized with the Upright MRI will be invisible (&#8220;missed&#8221;) if their patients are scanned at a higher field strengths.

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Image artifacts arising from metal implants such as surgical screws are diminished with the 0.6 Tesla Upright MRI compared to those from the high-field MRIs. It is well known that such artifacts get smaller as the MRI magnet&#8217;s field strength is reduced, so the anatomy adjacent to implanted hardware will be less obscured with the Upright MRI. This is particularly valuable for surgeons referring their postoperative patients for diagnostic imaging studies. 

&#160; 

Fonar faces competition within the MRI industry from such firms as General Electric Company, Philips N.V., Toshiba Corporation, Hitachi Corporation and Siemens A.G. Most competitors have marketing and financial resources more substantial than those available to us. They have in the past, and may in the future, heavily discount the sales price of their scanners. Such competitors sell both high field air core superconducting MRI scanners and iron frame products. Fonar&#8217;s original iron frame design, ultimately imitated by Fonar&#8217;s competitors to duplicate Fonar&#8217;s origination of &#8220;Open&#8221; MRI magnets, gave rise to current patent protected Upright&#174; MRI technology with the result that Fonar today is the unique and only supplier of the highest field MRI magnets (0.6 Tesla) that are not superconducting, do not use liquid helium and are not therefore susceptible to severe consequences and downtime cause by a system quench. 

&#160; 

The iron frame, because it controls the magnetic lines of force and places them where wanted and removes them from where not wanted, provides a more versatile magnet design than is possible with air core magnets. Air core magnets contain no iron but consist entirely of turns of current carrying wire. 

&#160; 

Fonar expects to be the leader in weight-bearing and positional MRI for providing dynamic visualization of body parts including the spine and extremities.

Fonar&#8217;s MRI scanners also compete with other diagnostic imaging systems, all of which are based upon the ability of energy waves to penetrate human tissue and to be detected by either photographic film or electronic devices for presentation of an image on a display monitor. Three different kinds of energy waves - X-ray, gamma and sound - are used in medical imaging techniques which compete with MRI medical scanning, the first two of which involve exposing the patient to potentially harmful radiation. These other imaging modalities compete with MRI products on the basis of specific applications. 

&#160; 

X-rays are the most common energy source used in imaging the body and are employed in three imaging modalities: 

&#160; 

1. Conventional X-ray systems, the oldest method of imaging, are typically used to image bones and teeth. The image resolution of adjacent structures that have high contrast, such as bone adjacent to soft tissue, is excellent, while the discrimination between soft tissue organs is poor because of the nearly equivalent penetration of x-rays. 

&#160; 

2. Computerized Tomography, also referred to as &#34;CT&#34;, systems couple computers to x-ray instruments to produce cross-sectional images of particular large organs or areas of the body. The CT scanner addresses the need for images, not available by conventional radiography, that display anatomic relationships spatially. However, CT images are generally limited to the transverse plane and cannot readily be obtained in the two other planes, sagittal and coronal. Improved picture resolution is available at the expense of increased exposure to x-rays from multiple projections. Furthermore, the pictures obtained by this method are computer reconstructions of a series of projections and, once diseased tissue has been detected, CT scanning cannot be focused for more detailed pictorial analysis or obtain a chemical analysis. 

&#160; 

3. Digital radiography systems add computer image processing capability to conventional x-ray systems. Digital radiography can be used in a number of diagnostic procedures which provide continuous imaging of a particular area with enhanced image quality and reduced patient exposure to radiation. 

&#160; 

Nuclear medicine systems, which are based upon the detection of gamma radiation generated by radioactive pharmaceuticals introduced into the body, are used to provide information concerning soft tissue and internal body organs and particularly to examine organ function over time.

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Ultrasound systems emit, detect and process high frequency sound waves reflected from organ boundaries and tissue interfaces to generate images of soft tissue and internal body organs. Although the images are substantially less detailed than those obtainable with x-ray methods, ultrasound is generally considered harmless and therefore has found particular use in imaging the pregnant uterus. 

&#160; 

X-ray machines, ultrasound machines, digital radiography systems and nuclear medicine compete with the MRI scanners by offering significantly lower price and space requirements. However, Fonar believes that the quality of the images produced by its MRI scanners is generally superior to the quality of the images produced by those other methodologies. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

FDA Regulation 

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations regulates the manufacturing and marketing of Fonar&#8217;s MRI scanners. The regulations can be classified as either pre-market or post-market. The pre-market requirements include obtaining marketing clearance, proper device labeling, establishment registration and device listing. Once the products are on the market, Fonar must comply with post-market surveillance controls. These requirements include the Quality Systems Regulation, or &#8220;QSR&#8221;, also known as Current Good Manufacturing Practices or CGMPs, and Medical Device Reporting, also referred to as MDR regulations. The QSR is a quality assurance requirement that covers the design, packaging, labeling and manufacturing of a medical device. The MDR regulation is an adverse event-reporting program. 

&#160; 

Classes of Products 

&#160; 

Under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, all medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes. A Class I device is subject only to general controls, such as labeling requirements and manufacturing practices; a Class II device must comply with certain performance standards established by the FDA; and a Class III device must obtain pre-market approval from the FDA prior to commercial marketing. Fonar&#8217;s products are Class II devices. Class II devices are subject to &#34;General Controls&#34;; General Controls include: 

&#160; 

1. Establishment registration of companies which are required to register under 21 CFR Part 807.20, such as manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers and re-labelers. 

2. Medical device listing with FDA of devices to be marketed. 

3. Manufacturing devices in accordance with the Current Good Manufacturing Practices Quality System Regulation in 21 CFR Part 820. 

4. Labeling devices in accordance with labeling regulations in 21 CFR Part 801 or 809. 

5. Submission of a Premarket Notification, pursuant to 510(k), before marketing a device. 

&#160; 

In addition to complying with general controls, Class II devices are also subject to special controls. Special controls may include special labeling requirements, guidance documents, mandatory performance standards and post-market surveillance. 

&#160; 

On October 3, 2000 Fonar received FDA clearance for the Upright&#174; MRI under the name &#8220;Indomitable&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Premarketing Submission 

&#160; 

Each person who wants to market Class I, II and some III devices intended for human use in the U.S. must submit a 510(k) to FDA at least 90 days before marketing unless the device is exempt from 510(k) requirements. A 510(k) is a pre-marketing submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, SE, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval, PMA. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently on the U.S. market and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. 

&#160; 

The FDA is committed to a 90-day clearance after submission of a 510(k), provided the 510(k) is complete and there is no need to submit additional information or data. 

&#160; Page 11 &#160; 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

The 510(k) is essentially a brief statement and description of the product. As Fonar&#8217;s scanner products are Class II products, there are no pre-market data requirements. 

&#160; 

An investigational device exemption, also referred to as IDE, allows the investigational device to be used in a clinical study pending FDA clearance in order to collect safety and effectiveness data required to support the Premarket Approval, also referred to as PMA, application or a Premarket Notification pursuant to 510(k), submission to the FDA. Clinical studies are most often conducted to support a PMA. 

&#160; 

For the most part, however, we have not found it necessary to utilize IDE&#8217;s. The standard 90 day clearance for our new MRI scanner products classified as Class II products makes the IDE unnecessary, particularly in view of the time and effort involved in compiling the information necessary to support an IDE. 

&#160; 

Quality System Regulation 

&#160; 

The Quality Management System is applicable to the design, manufacture, administration of installation and servicing of magnetic resonance imaging scanner systems. The FDA has authority to conduct detailed inspections of manufacturing plants, to establish Good Manufacturing Practices which must be followed in the manufacture of medical devices, to require periodic reporting of product defects and to prohibit the exportation of medical devices that do not comply with the law. 

&#160; 

Medical Device Reporting Regulation 

&#160; 

Manufacturers must report all MDR reportable events to the FDA. Each manufacturer must review and evaluate all complaints to determine whether the complaint represents an event which is required to be reported to FDA. Section 820.3(b) of the Quality Systems regulation defines a complaint as, &#34;any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a device after it is released for distribution.&#34; 

&#160; 

A report is required when a manufacturer becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of their marketed devices has or may have caused or contributed to a death, serious injury, or has malfunctioned and that the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. 

&#160; 

Malfunctions are not reportable if they are not likely to result in a death, serious injury or other significant adverse event experience. 

&#160; 

A malfunction which is or can be corrected during routine service or device maintenance still must be reported if the recurrence of the malfunction is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

&#160; 

We have established and maintained written procedures for implementation of the MDR regulation. These procedures include internal systems that: 

&#160; 

provide for timely and effective identification, communication and evaluation of adverse events; 

&#160; 

provide a standardized review process and procedures for determining whether or not an event is reportable; and 

&#160; 

provide procedures to insure the timely transmission of complete reports. 

&#160; 

These procedures also include documentation and record keeping requirements for: 

&#160; 

information that was evaluated to determine if an event was reportable; 

&#160; 

all medical device reports and information submitted to the FDA; 

&#160; 

any information that was evaluated during preparation of annual certification reports; and 

&#160; 

&#160; Page 12 &#160; 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

systems that ensure access to information that facilitates timely follow up and inspection by FDA. 

&#160; 

FDA Enforcement 

&#160; 

FDA may take the following actions to enforce the MDR regulation: 

&#160; 

FDA-Initiated or Voluntary Recalls 

&#160; 

Recalls are regulatory actions that remove a hazardous, potentially hazardous, or a misbranded product from the marketplace. Recalls are also used to convey additional information to the user concerning the safe use of the product. Either FDA or the manufacturer can initiate recalls. 

&#160; 

There are three classifications, i.e., I, II, or III, assigned by the Food and Drug Administration to a particular product recall to indicate the relative degree of health hazard presented by the product being recalled. 

&#160; 

Class I 

Is a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. 

&#160; 

Class II 

Is a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. 

&#160; 

Class III 

Is a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. 

&#160; 

Fonar has initiated six voluntary recalls. Five of the recalls were Class II and one was Class III. The recalls involved making minor corrections to the product in the field. Frequently, corrections which are made at the site of the device are called field corrections as opposed to recalls. 

&#160; 

Civil Money Penalties 

&#160; 

The FDA, after an appropriate hearing, may impose civil money penalties for violations of the FD&#38;C Act that relate to medical devices. In determining the amount of a civil penalty, FDA will take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violations, the violator's ability to pay, the effect on the violator's ability to continue to do business, and any history of prior violations. 

&#160; 

Warning Letters 

&#160; 

FDA issues written communications to a firm, indicating that the firm may incur more severe sanctions if the violations described in the letter are not corrected. Warning letters are issued to cause prompt correction of violations that pose a hazard to health or that involve economic deception. The FDA generally issues the letters before pursuing more severe sanctions. 

&#160; 

Seizure 

&#160; 

A seizure is a civil court action against a specific quantity of goods which enables the FDA to remove these goods from commercial channels. After seizure, no one may tamper with the goods except by permission of the court. The court usually gives the owner or claimant of the seized merchandise approximately 30 days to decide a course of action. If they take no action, the court will recommend disposal of the goods. If the owner decides to contest the government's charges, the court will schedule the case for trial. A third option allows the owner of the goods to request permission of the court to bring the goods into compliance with the law. The owner of the goods is required to provide a bond or, security deposit, to assure that they will perform the orders of the court, and the owner must pay for FDA supervision of any activities by the company to bring the goods into compliance. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Citation 

&#160; 

A citation is a formal warning to a firm of intent to prosecute the firm if violations of the FD&#38;C Act are not corrected. It provides the firm an opportunity to convince FDA not to prosecute. 

&#160; 

Injunction 

&#160; 

An injunction is a civil action filed by FDA against an individual or company. Usually, FDA files an injunction to stop a company from continuing to manufacture, package or distribute products that are in violation of the law. 

&#160; 

Prosecution 

&#160; 

Prosecution is a criminal action filed by FDA against a company or individual charging violation of the law for past practices. 

&#160; 

Foreign and Export Regulation 

&#160; 

We obtain approvals as necessary in connection with the sales of our products in foreign countries. In some cases, FDA approval has been sufficient for foreign sales as well. Our standard practice has been to require either the distributor or the customer to obtain any such foreign approvals or licenses which may be required. 

&#160; 

Legally marketed devices that comply with the requirements of the Food Drug &#38; Cosmetic Act require a Certificate to Foreign Government issued by the FDA for export. Other devices that do not meet the requirements of the FD&#38;C Act but comply with the laws of a foreign government require a Certificate of Exportability issued by the FDA. All products which we sell have FDA clearance and would fall into the first category. 

&#160; 

Foreign governments have differing requirements concerning the import of medical devices into their respective jurisdictions. The European Union, also referred to as EU, has some essential requirements described in the EU&#8217;s Medical Device Directive, also referred to as MDD. In order to export to one of these countries, we must meet the essential requirements of the MDD and any additional requirements of the importing country. The essential requirements are similar to some of the requirements mandated by the FDA. In addition the MDD requires that we enlist a Notified Body to examine and assess our documentation, a Technical Construction File, and verify that the product has been manufactured in conformity with the documentation. The notified body must carry out or arrange for the inspections and tests necessary to verify that the product complies with the essential requirements of the MDD, including safety performance and Electromagnetic Compatibility, also referred to as EMC. Also required is a Quality System, ISO-9001, assessment by the Notified Body. We were approved for ISO 9001 certification for its Quality Management System in April, 1999. 

&#160; 

We received clearance to sell the Upright&#174; MRI scanners in the EU in May, 2002. 

&#160; 

Other countries require that their own testing laboratories perform an evaluation of our devices. This requires that we must bring the foreign agency&#8217;s personnel to the USA to perform the evaluation at our expense before exporting. 

&#160; 

Some countries, including many in Latin America and Africa, have very few regulatory requirements, beyond FDA clearance. 

&#160; 

To date, Fonar has been able to comply with all foreign regulatory requirements applicable to its export sales.

&#160; 

PHYSICIAN AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES MANAGEMENT BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Effective July 1, 2015 we restructured the corporate organization of the physician and diagnostic services management segment of our business. Previously, Health Management Corporation of America our subsidiary, had transferred its business and assets to Imperial Management Services, LLC (&#8220;Imperial&#8221;), a New York limited liability company, in connection with raising capital from investors. Health Management Corporation of America maintained a majority interest in Imperial. The assets continued to be used in our business of managing diagnostic imaging facilities. 

&#160; 

Subsequently, through an agreement dated March 6, 2013, Health Management Corporation of America acquired another business engaged in the management and in Florida, the ownership, of diagnostic imaging facilities. The purchase was made through a new limited liability company, Health Diagnostics Management, LLC (&#8220;HDM&#8221;), which raised part of the capital necessary for the acquisition from investors. The investors received in the aggregate 49% of the interests in HDM. 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2016 the Company purchased 100% of the equity in Turnkey Services of New York, LLC and 100% of the equity in TK2 Equipment Management LLC. Turnkey Service of New York LLC and TK2 Equipment Management LLC both by way of several operating leases, had provided the Company with ancillary diagnostic imaging equipment to our managed MRI facilities. 

&#160; 

As a result of scheduled reacquisitions of interests held by the investors, as of July 1, 2015, Health Management Corporation of America owned a 100% interest in Imperial and a 70% interest in HDM immediately prior to the reorganization. 

&#160; 

The reorganization was structured to more completely integrate the operations of Health Management Corporation of America and HDM. Imperial contributed all of its assets (which were utilized in the business of Health Management Corporation of America) to HDM and received a 24.2% interest in HDM. Health Management Corporation of America retained a direct ownership interest of 45.8% in HDM, and the original investors in HDM retained a 30.0% ownership interest in the newly expanded HDM. 

&#160; 

The entire physician and diagnostic services management business segment is now being conducted by HDM. HDM&#8217;s Florida subsidiaries are directly engaged in the practice of medicine. HDM will operate under the assumed name, &#8220;Health Management Company of America&#8221; (&#8220;HMCA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The combined business (HDM, Imperial and Health Management Corporation of America) will be referred to as &#8220;HMCA&#8221; for all periods before and after July 1, 2015, unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160; 

HMCA provides comprehensive non-medical management services to diagnostic imaging facilities. These services include development, administration, leasing of office space, facilities, equipment, provision of supplies, staffing, training and supervision of non-medical personnel, credentialing, accounting, billing and collection, assistance with compliance matters and the development and implementation of practice growth and marketing strategies. 

&#160; 

As of August 1, 2016, HMCA managed a total of 25 MRI centers. For the 2015 fiscal year, the revenues HMCA recognized from the MRI facilities had increased to $57.6 million, and for the 2016 fiscal year the revenues further increased to $62.6 million. Four of these facilities in Florida are owned by HMCA subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

HMCA GROWTH STRATEGY 

&#160; 

HMCA&#8217;s growth strategy focuses on upgrading and expanding the existing facilities it manages and expanding the number of facilities it manages for its clients, including new sites. In connection with improving the performance of the facilities, we have added high field MRI scanners, extremity scanners and x-ray machines to the Upright MRI scanner at certain of the sites where such additional diagnostic imaging modalities are expected to produce the greatest return. 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

PHYSICIAN AND DIAGNOSTIC MANAGEMENT SERVICES 

&#160; 

HMCA&#8217;s services to the facilities it manages encompass substantially all of their business operations. Each facility is controlled, however, by the physician owner, not HMCA, and all medical services are performed by the physicians and other medical personnel under the physician-owner&#8217;s supervision. HMCA is the management company and performs services of a non-professional nature. These services include: 

&#160; 

1. Offices and Equipment. HMCA identifies, negotiates leases for and/or provides office space and equipment to its clients. This includes technologically sophisticated medical equipment. HMCA also provides improvements to leaseholds, assistance in site selection and advice on improving, updating, expanding and adapting to new technology. 

&#160; 

2. Personnel. HMCA staffs all the non-medical positions of its clients with its own employees, eliminating the client's need to interview, train and manage non-medical employees. HMCA processes the necessary tax, insurance and other documentation relating to employees. 

&#160; 

3. Administrative. HMCA assists in the scheduling of patient appointments, purchasing of office and medical supplies and equipment and handling of reporting, accounting, processing and filing systems. It prepares and files the physician portions of complex applications to enable its clients to participate in managed care programs and to qualify for insurance reimbursement. HMCA assists the clients to implement programs and procedures to ensure full and timely regulatory compliance and appropriate cost reimbursement under no-fault insurance and Workers' Compensation guidelines, as well as compliance with other applicable governmental requirements and regulations, including HIPAA and other privacy requirements. 

&#160; 

4. Billing and Collections. HMCA is responsible for the billing and collection of revenues from third-party payors including those governed by No-Fault and Workers' Compensation statutes. HMCA is presently using a third party to perform its billing and collection services for its clients&#8217; No-Fault and Workers&#8217; Compensation scanning business. 

&#160; 

5. Cost Saving Programs. Based on available volume discounts, HMCA seeks to assist in obtaining favorable pricing for office and medical supplies, medical imaging film, equipment, contrast agents, such as gadolinuim, and other inventory for its clients. 

&#160; 

6. Diagnostic Imaging and Ancillary Services. HMCA can offer access to diagnostic imaging equipment through diagnostic imaging facilities it manages. The Company is expanding the ancillary services offered in its network to include x-rays and other MRI equipment such as high field MRI scanners and extremity scanners. 

&#160; 

7. Marketing Strategies. HMCA is responsible for developing and proposing marketing plans for its clients. 

&#160; 

8. Expansion Plans. HMCA assists the clients in developing expansion plans including the opening of new or replacement facilities where appropriate. 

&#160; 

HMCA&#8217;s objective is to free physicians from as many non-medical duties as is practicable, allowing physicians to spend less time on business and administrative matters and more time practicing medicine. 

&#160; 

The exceptions to this general model of operation are four of the facilities acquired by HMCA from Health Diagnostics, LLC in April, 2013 in Florida. These Florida facilities are owned by limited liability companies which, as our subsidiaries, conduct their operations directly and bill and collect their fees from the patients and third party payors. 

&#160; 

The facilities enter into contracts with third party payors, including managed care companies. None of HMCA&#8217;s clients, however, participate in any capitated plans or other risk sharing arrangements. Capitated plans are those HMO programs where the provider is paid a flat monthly fee per patient. 

&#160; Page 16 &#160; 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

The management fees paid by the facilities to HMCA are flat monthly fees. In fiscal 2015, the aggregate amount of management fees were $3,483,916 per month. In fiscal 2016, the aggregate amount of management fees were $3,674,059. 

&#160; 

Fees under the management agreements are subject to adjustment by mutual agreement on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Dr. Damadian owns three of the MRI facilities in Florida managed by HMCA. The fees for these three sites in Florida owned by Dr. Damadian are flat monthly fees which are subject to adjustment by mutual agreement on an annual basis. In fiscal 2016, the aggregate amount of management fees paid to HMCA by these sites was $7,505,339. 

&#160; 

The Florida facilities owned by HMCA subsidiaries directly bill their patients or the patients&#8217; insurance carriers. Patient fees net of provision for bad debt were $18,446,023 in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

HMCA contracts with an outside billing company (Melville, New York) to perform billing and collection for their clients&#8217; No-Fault and Workers&#8217; Compensation business. The fixed monthly fees were $85,000 for HMCA in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

HMCA MARKETING 

&#160; 

HMCA's marketing strategy is to expand the business and improve the facilities which it manages. HMCA is seeking to increase the number of locations of those facilities where market conditions are promising and to promote growth of our clients' and Florida subsidiaries&#8217; patient volume and revenue. 

&#160; 

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING FACILITIES 

&#160; 

Diagnostic imaging facilities managed by HMCA provide diagnostic imaging services to patients referred by physicians who are either in private practice or affiliated with managed care providers or other payor groups. The facilities are operated in a manner which eliminates the admission and other administrative inconveniences of in-hospital diagnostic imaging services. Imaging services are performed in an outpatient setting by trained medical technologists under the direction of physicians employed by the diagnostic imaging facilities. Following diagnostic procedures, the images are reviewed by the interpreting physicians who prepare reports of these tests and their findings. Reports for the New York facilities are transcribed by HMCA personnel and reports for the Florida facilities are outsourced to independent contractors. 

&#160; 

HMCA develops marketing programs and educational programs in an effort to establish and maintain referring physician relationships for our clients and Florida subsidiaries and to maximize reimbursement yields. HMCA also directs its marketing and educational efforts to managed care providers. 

&#160; 

Managed care providers are an important factor in the diagnostic imaging industry. To further its position, HMCA is seeking to expand the imaging modalities offered at its managed and owned diagnostic imaging facilities. Three facilities in New York and three facilities in Florida have two MRI scanners. One facility in New York and two in Florida also perform x-rays. 

&#160; 

REIMBURSEMENT 

&#160; 

HMCA&#8217;s clients receive reimbursements for their services through Medicare, Medicaid, managed care, private commercial insurance, third party administrators, Workers&#8217; Compensation, No-Fault and other insurance. 

&#160; 

Medicare 

&#160; 

The Medicare program provides reimbursement for hospitalization, physician, diagnostic and certain other services to eligible persons 65 years of age and over and certain other individuals. 

&#160; Page 17 &#160; 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Providers are paid by the federal government in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services, HSS, and generally accept the payment with nominal deductible and co-insurance amounts required to be paid by the service recipient, as payment in full. Hospital inpatient services are reimbursed under a prospective payment system. 

&#160; 

Hospitals receive a specific prospective payment for inpatient treatment services based upon the diagnosis of the patient. 

&#160; 

Under Medicare&#8217;s prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services, or OPPS, a hospital is paid for outpatient services on a rate per service basis that varies according to the ambulatory payment classification group, or APC, to which the service is assigned rather than on a hospital&#8217;s costs. Each year the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, publishes new APC rates that are determined in accordance with the promulgated methodology. 

&#160; 

Services provided in non-hospital based freestanding facilities are paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS. All of HMCA&#8217;s clients are presently in this category. The MPFS is updated on an annual basis and sometimes modified more frequently. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform Legislation 

&#160; 

Healthcare reform legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2010 by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or PPACA, specifically requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in computing physician practice expense relative value units, to increase the equipment utilization factor for advanced diagnostic imaging services (such as MRI, CT and PET) from a presumed utilization rate of 50% to 65% for 2010 through 2012, 70% in 2013, and 75% thereafter. Excluded from the adjustment are low-technology imaging modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray and fluoroscopy. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872) or Reconciliation Act, which was approved by the President on March 30, 2010, amends the provision for higher presumed utilization of advanced diagnostic imaging services to a presumed rate of 75%. These changes may result in decreased revenue for the services performed by our clients for Medicare beneficiaries. Other changes in reimbursement for services rendered by Medicare Advantage plans may also reduce the revenues for services rendered to Medicare Advantage enrollees. 

&#160; 

We have experienced reimbursement reductions for radiology services provided to Medicare beneficiaries, including reductions pursuant to the Deficit Reduction Act, or DRA. 

&#160; 

The DRA, which became effective in 2007, set reimbursement for the technical component for imaging services (excluding diagnostic and screening mammography) in non-hospital based freestanding facilities at the lesser of OPPS or the MPFS. 

&#160; 

In addition to the foregoing changes to the usage assumptions, CMS&#8217; 2010 regulatory changes to the MPFS also included a downward adjustment to services primarily involving the technical component rather than the physician work component, by adjusting downward malpractice payments for these services. These adjustments have been phased in over a four year period. For our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, Medicare revenues represented approximately 5.0% of the revenues for HMCA&#8217;s clients and subsidiaries as compared to 5.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. In January, 2014 additional reductions in Medicare reimbursement were adopted, and New York State is expected to propose reducing Workers&#8217; Compensation reimbursements. 

&#160; 

Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict how the legislative mandates contained in PPACA will be implemented, in their complete and final form, whether any additional changes to PPACA or regulations (including interpretations), will occur in the future, or what effect any other future legislation or regulation would have on our business. Many commercial insurance companies, however, tie their reimbursement rates to the government reimbursement levels.

&#160; 

Medicaid 

&#160; 

The Medicaid program is a jointly-funded federal and state program providing coverage for low-income persons. In addition to federally-mandated basic services, the services offered and reimbursement methods vary from state to state. In many states, Medicaid reimbursement is patterned after the Medicare program; however, an increasing number of states have established or are establishing payment methodologies intended to provide healthcare services to Medicaid patients through managed care arrangements. In fiscal 2016, approximately 0.37% of the revenues of HMCA&#8217;s clients were attributable to Medicaid, as compared to 0.52% in fiscal 2015. Four of the Florida facilities (those owned by HMCA subsidiaries) do not participate in Medicaid. 

&#160; 

Managed Care and Private Insurance. 

&#160; 

Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMO&#8217;s, Preferred Provider Organizations, or PPOs, and other managed care organizations attempt to control the cost of healthcare services by a variety of measures, including imposing lower payment rates, preauthorization requirements, limiting services and mandating less costly treatment alternatives. Managed care contracting is competitive and reimbursement schedules are at or below Medicare reimbursement levels. Some managed care organizations have reduced or otherwise limited, and other managed care organizations may reduce or otherwise limit, reimbursement in response to reductions in government reimbursement. These reductions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These reductions have been, and any future reductions may be, similar to the reimbursement reductions proposed by CMS, Congress and the current federal government administration. 

&#160; 

HMCA COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The physician and diagnostic management services field is highly competitive. A number of large hospitals have acquired medical practices and this trend may continue. HMCA expects that more competition will develop. Many competitors have greater financial and other resources than HMCA. 

&#160; 

With respect to the diagnostic imaging facilities managed by HMCA, the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry is highly competitive. Competition focuses primarily on attracting physician referrals at the local market level and increasing referrals through relationships with managed care organizations, as well as emphasizing to potential referral sources the advantages of Upright&#174; MRI scanning. HMCA believes that principal competitors for the diagnostic imaging centers are hospitals and independent or management company-owned imaging centers. Competitive factors include quality and timeliness of test results, ability to develop and maintain relationships with managed care organizations and referring physicians, type and quality of equipment, facility location, convenience of scheduling and availability of patient appointment times. HMCA believes that it will be able to effectively meet the competition in the outpatient diagnostic imaging industry with the Fonar Upright&#174; MRI scanners and strategically placed high field MRI scanners at its facilities. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION APPLICABLE TO HMCA 

&#160; 

FEDERAL REGULATION 

&#160; 

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in laws and regulations can be significant. Changes in the law or new interpretation of existing laws can have a material effect on our permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors.

Federal False Claims Act 

&#160;

&#160; 

The federal False Claims Act and, in particular, the False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;qui tam&#8221; or &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions allow a private individual to bring actions in the name of the government alleging that a defendant has made false claims for payment from federal funds. After the individual has initiated the lawsuit the government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and to become the primary prosecutor. If the government declines to join the lawsuit, the individual may choose to pursue the case alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit, and may intervene later. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. 

&#160; 

When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim and the government&#8217;s attorneys&#8217; fees. Liability arises when an entity knowingly submits, or causes someone else to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term &#8220;knowingly&#8221; broadly, though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the False Claims Act. Examples of the other actions which may lead to liability under the False Claims Act: 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with the many technical billing requirements applicable to our Medicare and Medicaid business. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with the prohibition against billing for services ordered or supervised by physician who is excluded from any federal healthcare program, or the prohibition against employing or contracting with any person or entity excluded from any federal healthcare program. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with the Medicare physician supervision requirements for the services we provide, or the Medicare documentation requirements concerning physician supervision. 

&#160; 

The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the False Claims Act by, among other things, broadening protections for whistleblowers and creating liability for knowingly retaining a government overpayment, acting in deliberate ignorance of a government overpayment or acting in reckless disregard of a government overpayment. The recently enacted healthcare reform bills in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, &#8220;PPACA&#8221;) expanded on changes made by the 2009 Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act with regard to such &#8220;reverse false claims.&#8221; Under PPACA, the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, constitutes a violation of the False Claims Act. HMCA and its clients have never been sued under the False Claims Act and believe they are in compliance with the law. 

&#160; 

Stark Law 

&#160; 

Under the federal Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the &#34;Stark Law&#34;, which is applicable to Medicare and Medicaid patients, and the self-referral laws of various States, certain health practitioners, including physicians, chiropractors and podiatrists, are prohibited from referring their patients for the provision of designated health services, including diagnostic imaging and physical therapy services, to any entity with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless the referral fits within one of the specific exceptions in the statutes or regulations. The federal government has taken the position that a violation of the federal Stark Law is also a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. Statutory exceptions under the Stark Law include, among others, direct physician services, in-office ancillary services rendered within a group practice, space and equipment rental and services rendered to enrollees of certain prepaid health plans. Some of these exceptions are also available under the State self-referral laws. HMCA believes that it and its clients are in compliance with these laws.

Anti-kickback Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal and state laws which govern financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers. These include the federal anti-kickback statute which, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation, offer, payment or receipt of any remuneration, direct or indirect, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid and certain other governmental health programs. Under PPACA, knowledge of the anti-kickback statute or the specific intent to violate the law is not required. Violation of the anti-kickback statute may result in civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and according to PPACA, now provides a basis for liability under the False Claims Act. In addition, it is possible that private parties may file &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions based on claims resulting from relationships that violate the anti-kickback statute, seeking significant financial rewards. Many states have enacted similar statutes, which are not limited to items and services paid for under Medicare or a federally funded healthcare program. Neither HMCA nor its clients engage in this practice. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, approximately 5.0% of the revenues of HMCA&#8217;s clients were attributable to Medicare and 0.37% were attributable to Medicaid. In fiscal 2015, approximately 5.1% of the revenues of HMCA&#8217;s clients were attributable to Medicare and 0.52% were attributable to Medicaid. 

&#160; 

Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) 

&#160; 

On February 8, 2006, the President signed into law the DRA. Effective January 1, 2007, the DRA provides that Medicare reimbursement for the technical component for imaging services (excluding diagnostic and screening mammography) performed in freestanding facilities will be capped. Payment is the lesser of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule or the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) rates. Implementation of these reimbursement reductions contained in the DRA has had an adverse effect on our business. We have been able to counter this effect by increasing our clients&#8217; scan volumes through our vigorous marketing efforts and reducing our operating expenses. 

&#160; 

The DRA also codified the reduction in reimbursement for multiple images on contiguous body parts previously announced by CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program. In November 2005, CMS announced that it would pay 100% of the technical component of the higher priced imaging procedure and 50% of the technical component of each additional imaging procedure for imaging procedures involving contiguous body parts within a family of codes when performed in the same session. CMS had indicated that it would phase in this 50% rate reduction over two years, so that the reduction was 25% for each additional imaging procedure in 2006 and another 25% reduction in 2007. However, for services furnished on or after July 1, 2010, the PPACA requires the full 50% reduction to be implemented. 

&#160; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 

&#160; 

Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, in part, to combat healthcare fraud and to protect the privacy and security of patients&#8217; individually identifiable healthcare information. HIPAA, among other things, amends existing crimes and criminal penalties for Medicare fraud and enacts new federal healthcare fraud crimes, including actions affecting non-government healthcare benefit program by means of false or fraudulent representations in connection with the delivery of healthcare services is subject to a fine or imprisonment, or potentially both. In addition, HIPAA authorizes the imposition of civil money penalties against entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded Medicare or Medicaid program participants if such entities provide services to federal health program beneficiaries. A finding of liability under HIPAA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; Page 21 &#160; 

&#160;

FONAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Further, HIPAA requires healthcare providers and their business associates to maintain the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (&#8220;PHI&#8221;). HIPAA imposes federal standards for electronic transactions, for the security of electronic health information and for protecting the privacy of PHI. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), signed into law on February 17, 2009, dramatically expanded, among other things, (1) the scope of HIPAA to now apply directly to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; or independent contractors who receive or obtain PHI in connection with providing a service to a covered entity, (2) substantive security and privacy obligations, including new federal security breach notification requirements to affected individuals, DHHS and prominent media outlets, of certain breaches of unsecured PHI, (3) restrictions on marketing communications and a prohibition on covered entities or business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for PHI, and (4) the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for HIPAA violations, increasing the annual cap in penalties from $25,000 to $1.5 million per occurrence. In 2013 additional legal requirements were adopted to provide further protection for PHI. 

&#160; 

In addition, many states have enacted comparable privacy and security statues or regulations that, in some cases, are most stringent than HIPAA requirements. In those cases it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws, which may entail significant and costly changes for us. We believe that we are in compliance with such state laws and regulations. However, if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in compliance with the current HIPAA requirements, as amended by HITECH, together with other legislation and regulations, and comparable state laws, but we anticipate that we may encounter certain costs associated with future compliance. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that enforcement agencies or courts will not make interpretations of the HIPAA standards that are inconsistent with ours, or the interpretations of our contracted radiology practices or their affiliated physicians. A finding of liability under the HIPAA standards may result in significant criminal and civil penalties. Noncompliance also may result in exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Civil Money Penalty Law and Other Federal Statutes 

&#160; 

The Civil Money Penalty, or CMP, law covers a variety of practices. It provides a means of administrative enforcement of the anti-kickback statute, and prohibits false claims, claims for medically unnecessary services, violations of Medicare participating provider or assignment agreements and other practices. The statute gives the Office of Inspector General of the HHS the power to seek substantial civil fines, exclusion and other sanctions against providers or others who violate the CMP prohibitions. 

&#160; 

In addition, in 1996, Congress created a new federal crime: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

&#160; 

Certificates of Need 

&#160; 

Some states require hospitals and certain other healthcare facilities and providers to obtain a certificate of need, or CON, or similar regulatory approval prior to establishing certain healthcare operations or services, incurring certain capital projects and/or the acquisition of major medical equipment including MRI and PET/CT systems. We are not operating in any such states.

&#160; 

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law healthcare reform legislation in the form of PPACA. The implementation of this law will likely have a profound impact on the healthcare industry. Most of the provisions of PPACA are being phased in over time and can be conceptualized as a broad framework not only to provide health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but to fundamentally change the delivery of care by bringing together elements of health information technology, evidence-based medicine, chronic disease management, medical &#8220;homes,&#8221; care collaboration and shared financial risk in a way that will accelerate industry adoption and change. There are also many provisions addressing cost containment, reductions of Medicare and other payments and heightened compliance requirements and additional penalties, which will create further challenges for providers. We are unable to predict the full impact of PPACA at this time due to the law&#8217;s complexity and current lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance. Moving forward, we believe that the federal government will likely have greater involvement in the healthcare industry than in prior years. 

&#160; 

State Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to the federal self-referral law and federal Anti-kickback statute, many States, including those in which HMCA and its clients operate, have their own versions of self-referral and anti-kickback laws. These laws are not limited in their applicability, as are the federal laws, to specific programs. HMCA believes that it and its clients are in compliance with these laws. 

&#160; 

Various States prohibit business corporations from practicing medicine. Various States, including New York, also prohibit the sharing of professional fees or fee splitting. Consequently, in New York HMCA leases space and equipment to clients and provides clients with a range of non-medical administrative and managerial services for agreed upon fees. Under Florida law a business entity can bill patients and third party payors directly if that entity is properly licensed through AHCA. Four of the seven facilities in Florida are licensed healthcare clinics through AHCA. 

&#160; 

HMCA&#8217;s clients and subsidiaries generate revenue from patients covered by no-fault insurance and workers' compensation programs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 approximately 51.6% of our clients&#8217; receipts were from patients covered by no-fault insurance and approximately 7.8% of our client&#8217;s receipts were from patients covered by workers&#8217; compensation programs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, approximately 46.9% of HMCA&#8217;s clients&#8217; receipts were from patients covered by no-fault insurance and approximately 6.8% of HMCA&#8217;s clients&#8217; receipts were from patients covered by workers&#8217; compensation programs. (The foregoing numbers do not include payments from third party administrators). In the event that changes in these laws alter the fee structures or methods of providing service, or impose additional or different requirements, HMCA could be required to modify its business practices and services in ways that could be more costly to HMCA or in ways that decrease the revenues which HMCA receives from its clients. 

&#160; 

Compliance Program 

&#160; 

We maintain a program to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare entities. We have a compliance officer who is charged with implementing and supervising our compliance program, which includes the adoption of (i) Standards of Conduct for our employees and affiliates and (ii) a process that specifies how employees, affiliates and others may report regulatory or ethical concerns to our compliance officer. We believe that our compliance program meets the relevant standards provided by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. 

&#160; 

An important part of our compliance program consists of conducting periodic audits of various aspects of our operations and that of the contracted radiology practices. We also conduct mandatory educational programs designed to familiarize our employees with the regulatory requirements and specific elements of our compliance program. 

&#160; 

HMCA believes that it and its clients are in compliance with applicable Federal, State and local laws. HMCA does not believe that such laws will have any adverse material effect on its business.
