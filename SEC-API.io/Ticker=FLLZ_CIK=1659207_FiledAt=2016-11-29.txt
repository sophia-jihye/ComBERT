EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

The Company has recently started its operations and currently has no employees, other than our directors, who will initially perform all work in production and organization of our business. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The industry we are entering is concentrated and competitive. Competitors will include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. 

&#160; 

Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows: 

&#160; 

1. Increasing number of competitor: Other competitors may follow our business model of similar products manufacture, which will reduce our competitive edge. 

&#160; 

2. Price: Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our products at loss. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

3. New technologies: Newer trends in advertising market, such as online advertising, new fashion and new technologies in clothing manufacture, new materials used for car design instead of vinyl, etc., many of these factors may eventually have influence to efficiency of our business model. 

&#160; 

MARKETING 

&#160; 

As long as we have different kind of products to offer, our marketing campaign can involve many possible promotional activities. First of all we plan to use our logo on all the products we make as a way to raise customer awareness. 

&#160; 

We shall hand out our products, such as stickers and t-shirts with funny images at fairs and car shows. We plan to produce booklets and flyers with company information. We will place our stands at advertising trade shows offering our services for outdoor advertising on billboards, banners and light boxes. 

&#160; 

INSURANCE 

&#160; 

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
