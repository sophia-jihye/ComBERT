 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

The Company 

Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Apogee, the Company or we) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1949. We are a world leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass solutions for enclosing commercial buildings and framing art. 

Our Company has four reporting segments: 

&#8226; 

The Architectural Glass &#32;segment fabricates coated, high-performance glass used in customized window and wall systems comprising the outside skin of commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential buildings. For fiscal 2016 , our Architectural Glass segment accounted for approximately 35 percent &#32;of our net sales. 

&#8226; 

The Architectural Services &#32;segment designs, engineers, fabricates and installs the walls of glass, windows and other curtainwall products making up the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings. For fiscal 2016 , our Architectural Services segment accounted for approximately 25 percent &#32;of our net sales. 

&#8226; 

The Architectural Framing Systems segment designs, engineers, fabricates and finishes the aluminum frames used in customized aluminum and glass window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems comprising the outside skin and entrances of commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential buildings. For fiscal 2016 , our Architectural Framing Systems segment accounted for approximately 31 percent &#32;of our net sales. 

&#8226; 

The Large-Scale Optical Technologies &#32;(LSO) segment manufactures value-added glass and acrylic products for the custom picture framing and fine art markets. For fiscal 2016 , this segment accounted for approximately 9 percent &#32;of our net sales. 

In fiscal 2014, we acquired all of the shares of Alumicor Limited (Alumicor), a storefront, entrance and window systems company in Canada, for $52.9 million. Alumicor's results of operations are included in our Architectural Framing Systems segment. 

Strategy 

Our overall strategy in the Architectural Glass and Architectural Framing Systems segments is to deliver growth faster than our defined commercial construction markets. We accomplish this through geographic and market segment expansion and new product offerings, while differentiating ourselves through superior service and lead times, remaining focused on distinctive solutions for enclosing commercial buildings. In recent years, we have increased our focus on the window and curtainwall retrofit and renovation of existing commercial buildings. We have seen increased interest from the non-residential and high-end multi-family building sectors in upgrading the fa&#231;ades and improving the energy efficiency of their buildings. We consider this to be a significant opportunity for Apogee in the coming years. 

In the Architectural Services segment, our emphasis is on improving margins through focused project selection, while continuing to deliver organic growth in line with our available project management capacity. 

Within our LSO segment, our strategy is to grow by continuing to convert the custom picture framing and fine art markets from clear uncoated glass and acrylic products to value-added products that protect art from UV damage and minimize reflection, both within the United States (U.S.) and internationally. Additionally, we have begun identifying new display markets that desire the value-added properties our glass and acrylic products provide. 

Each of our segments has the ability to grow organically through geographic expansion and product line extension, and we also regularly evaluate business development opportunities in complementary sectors. These strategies can also be executed by acquisition or strategic alliances. 

Finally, we are constantly working to improve the efficiency and productivity of our manufacturing and installation operations by implementing lean manufacturing disciplines and automation throughout our business. We expect this initiative to continue to deliver gross margin expansion into the foreseeable future. 

Products and Services 

Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Architectural Framing Systems segments 

All of these segments participate in various phases of the value chain to design, engineer, fabricate and install customized aluminum and glass window, curtainwall, and storefront and entrance systems for buildings in the commercial, institutional and high-end multi-family residential construction sectors. 

In our Architectural Glass segment, we add ultra-thin, high-performance coatings to uncoated glass to create a variety of aesthetic characteristics, unique designs and energy efficiency, including varying levels of solar energy management, aligned with the 

industry trend of increasingly energy-efficient buildings. We also laminate layers of glass and vinyl to protect against hurricanes and other severe impacts, and temper, or heat strengthen, glass to provide additional strength. Our high-performance glass is custom made-to-order and is typically fabricated into insulating and/or laminated glass units to allow for installation into window, curtainwall, storefront or entrance systems. 

By integrating technical capabilities, project management skills and field installation services, we provide design, engineering, fabrication and installation expertise for the building envelope within our Architectural Services segment. The services we provide allow our customers to meet the timing and cost requirements of their jobs by providing efficiently designed and high-quality window and curtainwall systems and effectively managing the installation of the fa&#231;ade on their building projects. 

Within our Architectural Framing segment, we design and fabricate window, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using our customized aluminum and glass, or glass supplied by others. We also provide finishing services for the metal and plastic components used to frame windows, curtainwall and other products. 

Our product offerings allow architects to create distinctive looks for office towers, hotels, education facilities and dormitories, health care facilities, government buildings, retail centers and multi-family residential buildings, while meeting functional requirements such as energy efficiency, hurricane, blast and other impact resistance and/or sound control. 

LSO segment 

The LSO segment provides coated glass and acrylic primarily for use in custom picture framing and fine art markets. Products vary based on size and coatings applied to provide conservation-grade UV protection, anti-reflective and anti-static properties and/or security features. 

Product Demand and Distribution Channels 

Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Architectural Framing Systems Segments 

Demand for the products and services offered by our Architectural segments is affected by changes in the North American commercial construction industries, as well as by changes in general economic conditions. As the Architectural Glass segment also has an operation in Brazil, it is also impacted by the commercial construction industry and general economic conditions in that region. 

We look at several external indicators to analyze demand for our products and services, such as U.S. job growth, office space vacancy rates, construction starts, credit and interest rates available for commercial construction projects, architectural billing statistics and material costs. We also utilize data on U.S. non-residential construction market activity from Dodge Data &#38; Analytics, a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis, forecasts and trends. We reference this information as independent data points specific to the building types that we typically serve, adjusted to align with our fiscal year and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project, which is approximately eight months after project start. 

We also rely on our own internal indicators to analyze demand. This includes our sales pipeline, made up of contracts in review, projects awarded or committed, and bidding and quoting activity. Our sales pipeline, together with ongoing feedback, analysis and data from our customers, architects and building owners, provide visibility into near- and medium-term future demand. &#32; 

&#160; 

Our architectural products and services are used in a subset of the construction industry that is differentiated by building type, level of customization required, customers, geographic location and project size. 

Building type &#32;- The construction industry is typically segmented into residential construction and non-residential construction, which includes commercial, industrial and institutional construction. Our products and services are primarily used in commercial buildings (office towers, hotels and retail centers) and institutional buildings (education facilities and dormitories, health care facilities and government buildings), as well as in high-end multi-family residential buildings (a subset of residential construction). 

Level of customization &#32;- The large majority of our projects involve a high degree of customization, as the product or service is based on customer-specified requirements for aesthetics, performance and size, and is designed to satisfy local building codes. 

Customers and distribution channels &#32;- Our customers are mainly general contractors and glazing subcontractors, with project design being influenced by architects and building owners. Our high-performance architectural glass is primarily sold using a direct sales force and independent sales representatives. Installation services are marketed by a direct sales force, primarily in the metropolitan areas in the U.S. where we have a physical presence. We also have the ability to provide remote project management throughout the U.S. We market our custom and standard windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrance systems using a combination of direct sales forces, independent sales representatives and distributors. 

Geographic location &#32;- We primarily supply architectural glass products to customers in the U.S., with some international sales of our high-performance architectural glass. We estimate the U.S. demand for architectural glass fabrication in non-residential buildings is in excess of $1 billion annually. In installation services, we are one of only a few architectural glass installation companies in the U.S. to have a national presence, and we estimate the U.S. demand to be in the range of $8 to $15 billion over a non-residential construction cycle of eight to ten years. Our aluminum framing systems, including windows, curtainwall, storefront and entrances, are marketed in the U.S. and Canada, and we estimate demand to be in excess of $3 billion annually. 

Project size &#32;- Our Architectural Glass segment primarily serves mid-size to monumental high-profile projects. Architectural Services primarily serves mid-size projects and Architectural Framing Systems primarily targets small and mid-size projects. 

LSO Segment 

In our LSO segment, we have the largest domestically manufactured brand of value-added glass and acrylic for custom picture framing. Under the Tru Vue brand, products are sold primarily in North America through national and regional retail chains using a direct sales force, as well as through local picture framing shops using an independent distribution network. We also supply products to museums and public and private galleries and collections worldwide through independent distributors. In addition to the U.S., the LSO segment sells its glass and acrylic products in Europe and other international geographies using independent distributors. 

Competitive Conditions 

Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Architectural Framing Systems segments 

The North American commercial construction market is highly fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product quality, product attributes and performance, reliable service, on-time delivery, lead-time, warranty and the ability to provide technical engineering and design services. To protect and enhance our competitive position, we maintain strong relationships with architects, who influence the selection of products and services on a project, and with general contractors, who initiate projects and develop specifications. 

In our Architectural Glass segment, we experience competition from regional glass fabricators who can provide certain products with attributes similar to our products. Within the market sector for large, complex projects, we encounter competition from international companies, which have products equivalent to and larger size capabilities than our own. This international competition has been exacerbated recently by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. 

When providing installation services, our Architectural Services segment primarily competes against regional and local glass installation companies, and periodically against other larger national companies. The commercial window and storefront manufacturing industry is highly fragmented, and our Architectural Framing Systems segment competes against several national, regional and local aluminum window and storefront manufacturers, as well as regional paint and anodizing companies. 

LSO Segment 

Product attributes, price, quality, marketing and service are the primary competitive factors in the LSO segment. Our competitive strengths include our excellent relationships with customers, innovative marketing programs and the performance of our value-added products. There is competition in North America and Europe from certain European valued-added products for picture framing. 

Warranties 

We offer product and service warranties that we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products and services are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product or service, the market and, in some cases, the customer being served. Our standard warranties are generally from two to 10 years for our architectural glass, curtainwall and window system products, while we generally offer warranties of two years or less on our other products and installation services. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

Raw materials used within the Architectural Glass segment include flat glass, vinyl, silicone sealants and lumber. Within the Architectural Services segment, materials used include fabricated glass, aluminum extrusions and fabricated metal panels. Our Architectural Framing Systems segment's materials include aluminum billet and extrusions, fabricated glass, plastic extrusions, hardware, paint and chemicals. The LSO segment mainly uses glass and acrylics. A majority of our raw materials is readily available from a variety of domestic and international sources. 

Trademarks and Patents 

We have several trademarks and trade names that we believe have significant value in the marketing of our products, including APOGEE &#174; . Trademark registrations in the U.S. are generally for a term of 10 years, renewable every 10 years as long as the trademark is used in the regular course of trade.

TRULIFE INFINITY FRAME TM &#32;is an unregistered trademark. 

We have several patents pertaining to our glass coating methods and products, including our UV coating and etch processes for anti-reflective glass for the picture framing industry and fine art market. Despite being a point of differentiation from our competitors, no single patent is considered to be material. 

Seasonality 

We do not experience a significant seasonal effect in our Architectural segments. A bigger impact to net sales is the fact that the construction industry is highly cyclical in nature and can be influenced differently by the effects of local economies. 

Within the LSO segment, picture framing glass and acrylic sales tend to increase in the September-to-December timeframe. However, the timing of customer promotional activities may offset some of this seasonal impact. 

Working Capital Requirements 

Trade accounts receivable is the largest component of working capital for the Company, including receivables relating to contractual retention amounts that can be outstanding throughout the project duration within the Architectural Services segment. Inventory requirements are not significant in any of our Architectural segments, because these businesses make-to-order rather than build-to-stock for the majority of their products. 

Since the LSO segment builds to stock for the majority of its products, it requires greater inventory levels to meet the demands of its customers. 

Backlog 

A discussion of our consolidated backlog is included at page 18 within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Research and Development 

The amount spent on research and development activities was $8.0 million , $6.5 million &#32;and $7.8 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Of this amount, $2.4 million , $2.4 million &#32;and $2.1 million , respectively, was focused primarily upon design of custom window and curtainwall systems in accordance with customer specifications and is included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Environment 

We use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. As a result, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local regulations governing the storage and use of these materials and disposal of wastes. We contract with outside vendors to collect and dispose of waste at our production facilities in compliance with applicable environmental laws. In addition, we have procedures in place that we believe enable us to properly manage the regulated materials used in and wastes created by our manufacturing processes, and we have implemented a program to monitor our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe we are currently in material compliance with such laws and regulations, current or future laws and regulations could require us to make substantial expenditures for compliance with chemical storage and use, waste treatment or disposal regulations. Spending to reduce wastewater solids and hazardous air emissions at our facilities is not significant. We expect to incur costs to continue to comply with laws and regulations in the future for our ongoing manufacturing operations but do not expect these to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 

In fiscal 2008, we acquired one manufacturing facility that has certain historical environmental conditions. We are working to remediate these conditions, and the remediation activities are being conducted without significant disruption to our operations. 

Employees 

The Company employed 4,614 &#32;and 4,802 &#32;persons on February 27, 2016 &#32;and February 28, 2015 , respectively. At February 27, 2016 , 355 &#32;of these employees were represented by U.S. labor unions and 256 &#32;of these employees were represented by labor unions in Brazil.
