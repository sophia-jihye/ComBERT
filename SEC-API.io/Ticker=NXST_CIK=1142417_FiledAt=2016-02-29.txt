Business 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a television broadcasting and digital media company focused exclusively on the acquisition, development and operation of television stations and interactive community websites in medium-sized markets in the United States. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 99 full power television stations, including those owned by VIEs with which we have local service agreements, in 61 markets in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Our stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MyNetworkTV and other broadcast television networks. We reach approximately 20.4 million viewers or 18.0% of all U.S. television households.

&#160;

We believe that medium-sized markets offer significant advantages over large-sized markets. First, because there are fewer well-capitalized acquirers with a medium-market focus, we have been successful in purchasing stations on more favorable terms than acquirers of large market stations. Second, in the majority of our markets only four to six local commercial television stations exist. As a result, we achieve lower programming costs than stations in larger markets because the supply of quality programming exceeds the demand. 

&#160;

The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over-the-air programming to our markets&#8217; television viewing audiences. This programming includes (a) programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated; (b) programs that the stations produce; and (c) first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our primary sources of revenue include the sale of commercial air time on our stations to local and national advertisers, revenues earned from our retransmission consent agreements with cable, satellite and other multichannel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;) in our markets, and the sale of advertising on our websites in each of our broadcast markets where we deliver community focused content.

&#160;

We seek to grow our revenue and operating income by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, as well as through our growing portfolio of digital products and services. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations&#8217; strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by broadcasting the programming of multiple networks, capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. As a result of our operational enhancements, we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations. 

&#160;

Our digital media businesses provide digital publishing and content management platforms, a digital video advertising platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms.

&#160;

Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv . 

&#160;

Recent Acquisitions 

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2015, we acquired the outstanding equity of privately-held Communications Corporation of America (&#8220;CCA&#8221;) as well as CCA&#8217;s rights and obligations with respect to certain operating agreements between CCA and White Knight Broadcasting (&#8220;White Knight&#8221;) for $278.1 million in cash. CCA and White Knight, collectively, owned 14 full power television stations in 10 markets. Simultaneous with our acquisition of CCA, we sold the assets of two CCA stations, KPEJ and KMSS, to Marshall Broadcasting Group, Inc. (&#8220;Marshall&#8221;) for $43.3 million in cash and we entered into local service agreements with Marshall to perform certain sales and other services for these stations. Additionally, we sold the assets of a CCA station, WEVV, the CBS and FOX affiliate serving the Evansville market, to Bayou City Broadcasting Evansville, Inc. (&#8220;BCB&#8221;) for $27.4 million in cash. We recognized a net loss on disposal of $0.5 million in connection with this transaction. There is no relationship between us and BCB or the stations we and BCB own after the sale.

&#160;

We paid a deposit of $27.0 million to CCA in April 2013 upon signing the stock purchase agreement. The remaining purchase price was funded at closing through a combination of borrowings under our existing credit facility and cash on hand. Marshall funded the payment of the purchase price to us through borrowings under its credit facility, which we guarantee. These transactions allow the Company entrance into seven new markets and create new duopolies in four markets. The full power television stations are as follows:

Effective January 29, 2015, we acquired the assets of KASW, the CW affiliate in the Phoenix, Arizona market for $70.8 million in cash. This acquisition allows us entrance into the Phoenix market and we funded the purchase price through a portion of the proceeds from our $275.0 million 6.125% Senior Unsecured Notes issued on January 29, 2015 (&#8220;6.125% Notes&#8221;) and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

&#160;

On February 2, 2015, we acquired the outstanding equity of Yashi, Inc. (&#8220;Yashi&#8221;), a local digital video advertising and targeted programmatic technology platform for $33.4 million in cash. This acquisition broadens our digital media portfolio with technologies and offerings that are complementary to our digital and multi-screen strategies. The purchase price was funded through a portion of the proceeds of our offering of 6.125% Notes and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

&#160;

On February 13, 2015, we acquired the outstanding equity of the owner of KLAS, the CBS affiliate serving the Las Vegas, Nevada market for $150.8 million in cash. This acquisition allows us entrance into the Las Vegas market and the purchase price was funded through a portion of the proceeds of our offering of 6.125% Notes and borrowings under our existing credit facility.

&#160;

Effective October 1, 2015, we acquired the outstanding equity of Kixer, Inc. (&#8220;Kixer&#8221;) for $8.5 million in cash, funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, the sellers could receive up to $7.0 million in cash payments if certain revenue targets are met during the year 2016 in accordance with the purchase agreement (the &#8220;Earnout Payments&#8221;). We expect to fund the Earnout Payments through a combination of cash to be generated from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Kixer is an advertising technology platform focused on optimizing and driving new mobile revenue streams for content publishers and this acquisition broadens our digital media portfolio with technologies and offerings that are complementary to our digital and multi-screen strategies.

&#160;

On February 1, 2016, we acquired the assets of four full power television stations in the Minot-Bismarck-Dickinson, North Dakota market for $44.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments for working capital, f unded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The stations, all affiliated with CBS, are KXMC , KXMB, KXMA and KXMD. Th is acquisition allows us entrance into th is North Dakota market. 

&#160;

Pending Acquisitions

&#160;

On January 27, 2016, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Media General, Inc., a Virginia corporation (&#8220;Media General&#8221;), to acquire Media General&#8217;s outstanding equity for $10.55 per share in cash and 0.1249 of a share our Class A common stock for each Media General share. The terms of the agreement also include potential additional consideration to Media General shareholders in the form of a non-transferable contingent value right (&#8220;CVR&#8221;) entitling Media General shareholders to net cash proceeds from any sale of Media General&#8217;s spectrum in the Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) upcoming spectrum auction. Depending on the timing of the FCC auction, the CVR may be issued before or at the time of the merger. Each unvested Media General stock option outstanding prior to the completion of the merger will become fully vested and will be converted into an option to purchase our Class A common stock, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement. Additionally, unless the CVR has been issued prior to the completion of the merger, the holders of Media General stock options will also be entitled to one CVR for each share subject to the Media General stock option immediately prior to the completion of the merger. All other equity-based awards of Media General that are outstanding prior to the merger will vest in full and will be converted into the right to receive the cash, stock and contingent consideration described above, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. The total consideration for this proposed acquisition is approximately $2.0 billion in cash and stock, estimated based on the $39.08 market price per share of our Class A Common Stock on February 17, 2016 and Media General&#8217;s diluted common shares outstanding, plus the potential CVR. Media General currently owns, operates or provides services to 71 television stations in 48 markets. We and Media General plan to divest certain of our stations in connection with the proposed merger in order to comply with the FCC media ownership rules.

&#160;

The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Media General. If the merger agreement is terminated in connection with Media General entering into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal, as well as under certain other circumstances, the termination fee payable to us will be $80.0 million. If the merger agreement is terminated because the required Media General shareholder vote is not obtained at a shareholder meeting duly held for such purpose, the amount of the termination fee payable to us will be $20.0 million. The merger agreement also provides that we will be required to pay a termination fee to Media General of $80.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and a termination fee of $20.0 million if the required Nexstar shareholder vote is not obtained at a shareholder meeting duly held for such purpose. Either party may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated on or before January 27, 2017, with an automatic extension to April 27, 2017, if necessary to obtain regulatory approval under circumstances specified in the merger agreement.

&#160;

The merger is subject to a vote by stockholders of Nexstar and Media General, FCC approval and other regulatory approvals (including expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period) and other customary closing conditions. The merger is not subject to any financing condition and we have received committed financing up to a maximum of $4.7 billion from a group of commercial banks to provide the debt financing to consummate the merger and the refinancing of certain of the existing indebtedness of Nexstar, Media General and certain of their variable interest entities. With respect to Nexstar and certain of its variable interest entities, the debt refinancing will include the outstanding obligations under the revolving credit facilities and term loans.

&#160;

Upon completion of the merger, which is expected to occur late in the third quarter/early in the fourth quarter of 2016, the combined company will be named Nexstar Media Group, Inc.

&#160;

On November 16, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of four full power television stations in four markets in West Virginia for $130.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments for working capital. The stations are as follows:

This acquisition will allow us entrance into these markets. Effective December 1, 2015, we began providing programming and sales services to these stations pursuant to a Time Brokerage Agreement (&#8220;TBA&#8221;) which will terminate upon final closing or upon termination of the purchase agreement. On January 4, 2016, we acquired certain of the stations&#8217; assets and paid $65.0 million of the purchase price funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The acquisition is subject to FCC approval and other customary conditions and the remaining purchase price of $65.0 million is expected to be funded through cash generated from operations prior to the second closing and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. We project the final closing to occur in December 2016.

On October 24, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of KCWI, the CW affiliate in the Des Moines-Ames, Iowa market for $3.5 million , which we expect to fund through cash on hand. This acquisition is subject to bankruptcy approval and other customary conditi ons and we expect it to close in 2016. 

&#160;

On May 27, 2014, Mission Broadcasting, Inc. (&#8220;Mission&#8221;) assumed the rights, title and interest to an existing purchase agreement to acquire Parker Broadcasting of Colorado, LLC (&#8220;Parker&#8221;), the owner of television station KFQX, the FOX affiliate in the Grand Junction, Colorado market, for $4.0 million in cash, subject to adjustments for working capital. Mission paid a deposit of $3.2 million on June 13, 2014. Mission expects to fund the remaining purchase price through cash generated from operations prior to closing. The acquisition is subject to FCC approval and other customary conditions and Mission expects it to close in 2016. The acquisition will allow Mission entrance into this market. In June 2014, Nexstar assumed the contractual obligations under a TBA with Parker to perform certain sales and other services for KFQX. Parker is consolidated into the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

Operating Strategy 

We seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies: 

Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. Based on internally generated analysis, we believe that in over 78.0% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we earned approximately 30% of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to that produce local newscasts provide between 15 and 25 hours per week of local news programming. Extensive local sports coverage and active sponsorship of community events further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal. 

Invest in Digital Media. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services. Our websites provide access to our local news and information, as well as community centric business and services. We delivered a record audience across all of our web sites in 2015, with 115 million unique visitors, who utilized over 848 million page views. Also in 2015, our mobile platform accounted for 46% of our overall page views by year end. We also launched redesigned web sites, ready for the emerging touch oriented platforms. We have also invested in additional digital media product lines, including a content management solution and a targeted video advertising platform. We are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want. 

Emphasize Local Sales. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. Additionally, local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue generated from local advertising represented 70.6% of our consolidated spot revenue (total of local and national advertising revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period. 

Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 70.0% of our net revenue, excluding trade and barter revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from our duopoly markets. 

Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to. 

Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations . We currently own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliated stations which represented approximately 20.0 %, 25.0 %, 24.0 % and 18.0 %, respectively, of our 2015 combined local, national and political revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NBA basketball, Major League baseball, NFL football, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network progr amming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio&#8217;s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network. 

Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets. Most of our station general managers have been granted stock options and have an average of over 20 years of experience in the television broadcasting industry. 

Acquisition Strategy 

We selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations primarily in medium-sized markets where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management. When considering an acquisition, we evaluate the target audience share, revenue share, overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters. Additionally, we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets. 

Relationship with VIEs

Through various local service agreements, we provide sales, programming and other services to 25 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2015 and five full power television stations owned by VIEs which are not consolidated. All of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs&#8217; stations, (2) Nexstar&#8217;s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission&#8217;s and Marshall&#8217;s senior secured credit facilities, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs&#8217; economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, for Mission, White Knight and Parker, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission and White Knight that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission or White Knight station, subject to FCC consent. The Mission purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission or its shareholders for consideration equal to the greater of (1) seven times the station&#8217;s cash flow, as defined in the option agreement, less the amount of its indebtedness, as defined in the option agreement, or (2) the amount of its indebtedness. Additionally, on November 29, 2011, Mission&#8217;s shareholders granted Nexstar an option to purchase any or all of Mission&#8217;s stock, subject to FCC consent, for a price equal to the pro rata portion of the greater of (1) five times the stations&#8217; cash flow, as defined in the agreement, reduced by the amount of indebtedness, as defined in the agreement, or (2) $100,000. The White Knight option agreements also are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by White Knight or its shareholder for consideration equal to the greater of (i) an amount equal to six (6) times the annual Net Income (as defined in the option) of the Station or (ii) $100,000. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2017 and 2024. We expect our option agreements with Mission and White Knight to be renewed upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements.

Industry Background 

Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. Currently, a limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by Nielsen Corporation, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as designated market areas (&#8220;DMAs&#8221;) that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen Corporation periodically publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in the DMA. The estimates are expressed in terms of a &#8220;rating,&#8221; which is a station&#8217;s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a &#8220;share,&#8221; which is the station&#8217;s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station&#8217;s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates. 

Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station&#8217;s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for network affiliation fees and the network&#8217;s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs. 

Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, cable and satellite television systems, the Internet and, to a lesser extent, with newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the Internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations. 

Advertising Sales 

General 

Television station revenue is primarily derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming. 

Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station&#8217;s local sales staff. 

Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

a program&#8217;s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the number of advertisers competing for the available time; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the availability of alternative advertising media in the market; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the effectiveness of the station&#8217;s sales force; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser. 

Advertising rates are also determined by a station&#8217;s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station&#8217;s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations. 

Seasonality 

Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns, and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations&#8217; advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. 

Local Sales 

Local advertising time is sold by each station&#8217;s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel. 

National Sales 

National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers, and national retailers (some of which may advertise locally). 

Compensation for Retransmission Consent 

We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs in our markets in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with MVPDs have created agreements that now produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams.

Network Affiliations 

All of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to as of December 31, 2015 are affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The agreements with ABC, FOX, NBC, and CBS are the most significant to our operations. The terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

&#160;

&#160;

Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.

&#160;

Competition 

Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.

Audience . We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station&#8217;s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to sell their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices such as tablets and cell phones, which presents an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems (such as VCRs, DVDs and DVRs), video-on-demand and pay-per-view, the Internet (including network distribution of programming through websites) and gaming devices. 

Although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems, such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite (&#8220;DBS&#8221;) systems which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market, have become significant competitors for the over-the-air television audience.

Programming . Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off-network reruns (such as Two and a Half Men ) and first-run product (such as Entertainment Tonight ) in their respective markets. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Time Warner, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Viacom Inc., CBS Corporation, The News Corporation Limited and the Walt Disney Company each owns a television network and multiple cable networks and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary sources of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. 

Advertising . Stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, local cable systems, DBS systems and the Internet. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. 

The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and a dvertisers. The increased use of digital technology by cable systems and DBS, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video deliv ery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and enc ourage the development of increasingly specialized &#8220;niche&#8221; programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or othe r technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services. 

&#160;

Federal Regulation 

Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, you should refer to the Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies. 

License Grant and Renewal . The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC&#8217;s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC&#8217;s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. 

After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application. 

In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture. 

Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC&#8217;s processing of a timely renewal application. 

Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval. 

Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%, and historically the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in limited circumstances. In November 2013, the FCC clarified that it would entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and solicited public comment on related matters, such as revising the methodology that broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the 25% limit. 

The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations. These ownership limits apply to attrib utable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of qualified investment companies, su ch as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The F CC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee&#8217;s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station&#8217;s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable in terest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules, such as a radio or television station or daily newspaper. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of q ualified investment companies, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar. 

Two of Nexstar&#8217;s directors currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 58 radio stations in 17 markets. The FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar, due to this common director relationship. In addition, one of Nexstar&#8217;s shareholders who holds an attributable interest in Nexstar also holds attributable interests in television stations in the Seattle-Tacoma, Washington, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, California, Providence, RI-New Bedford, Massachusetts and Palm Springs, California television markets.

Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or &#8220;duopoly,&#8221; rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations in the DMA with overlapping service contours and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA. The duopoly rule allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station only in cases where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt. 

Under the duopoly rule, the FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a time brokerage or local marketing agreement, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station&#8217;s weekly broadcast programming. However, local marketing agreements entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This &#8220;grandfathering,&#8221; when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. 

In March 2014, the FCC adopted a rule that attributes another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station&#8217;s weekly advertising inventory under a joint sales agreement (&#8220;JSA&#8221;). Parties to existing JSAs that do not comply with the newly adopted rule were given two years from the effective date of the rule to modify or terminate their JSAs to come into compliance. Subsequent federal legislation extended the JSA compliance deadline until September 30, 2025. Various parties, including us (and Mission, which has intervened) have appealed the JSA attribution rule to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appeal was transferred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in November 2015, and oral arguments will be heard in the case on April 19, 2016.

In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC&#8217;s duopoly rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations. 

In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. However, we also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to waivers under the FCC&#8217;s rules permitting common ownership of a &#8220;satellite&#8221; television station in a market where a licensee also owns the &#8220;primary&#8221; station. Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa market pursuant to a waiver allowing ownership of a second station where that station is &#8220;failing.&#8221;

In all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements, except for three, we provide programming comprising less than 15% of the second station&#8217;s programming. In the three markets where we provide more programming to the second station&#8212;WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, and KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado&#8212;the local marketing agreements were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise.

With respect to our other local service agreements, the FCC&#8217;s 2014 rule makes a majority of our JSAs attributable, but the December 2015 federal appropriations legislation allows us to maintain those agreements in effect through September 30, 2025. Our shared services agreements with independently owned same-market stations remain permissible for now, but the FCC has left open the possibility of additional regulations with respect to such agreements. 

&#160;

National Television Ownership . There is no nationwide limit on the number of television stations which a party may own. However, the FCC&#8217;s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests i n television stations to 39%. This rule further provides that when calculating a party&#8217;s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of an ultra-high frequency (&#8220;UHF&#8221;) station is counted as 50% of a market&#8217;s percentage of total national audience. In September 2013, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to consider whether the UHF discount should be eliminated and/or whether a VHF discount should be implemented; however, no decision has been issued yet. 

&#160;

The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of 10.7% of television households with the UHF discount. 

Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (One-to-a-Market Rule). In markets with at least 20 independently owned media &#8220;voices,&#8221; ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations, or two television stations (if allowed under the television duopoly rule) and six radio stations is permitted. If the number of independently owned media &#8220;voices&#8221; is fewer than 20 but greater than or equal to 10, ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and four radio stations is permitted. In markets with fewer than 10 independent media &#8220;voices,&#8221; ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and one radio station is permitted. In calculating the number of independent media &#8220;voices&#8221; in a market, the FCC includes all radio and television stations, independently owned cable systems (counted as one voice), and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds 5% of the households in the market. In all cases, the television and radio components of the combination must also comply, respectively, with the local television ownership rule and the local radio ownership rule. 

Because two of Nexstar&#8217;s directors also currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 58 radio stations in 17 markets, the FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar. Therefore, depending on the number of radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. in a given market, we may not be able to purchase a television station in the market. 

Local Television/Newspaper Cross-Ownership Rule. Under this rule, a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper in the same market. 

The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the &#8220;public interest, convenience and necessity.&#8221; In March 2014, the FCC initiated its 2014 quadrennial review with the adoption of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM). The FNPRM solicits comment on proposed changes to the media ownership rules. Among the proposals in the FNPRM are (1) retention of the current local television ownership rule (but with modifications to certain service contour definitions to conform to digital television broadcasting), (2) elimination of the radio/television cross-ownership rule, (3) elimination of the newspaper/radio cross-ownership rule, and (4) retention of the newspaper/television cross-ownership rule, while considering waivers of that rule in certain circumstances. The FNPRM also proposes to define a category of sharing agreements designated as shared services agreements (&#8220;SSAs&#8221;) between television stations, and to require television stations to disclose those SSAs. Comments and reply comments on the FNPRM were filed in 2014. 

Local Television/Cable Cross-Ownership. There is no FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area. 

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations&#8217; signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through &#8220;retransmission consent.&#8221; Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (&#8220;must-carry&#8221; for cable distributors and &#8220;carry one-carry all&#8221; for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2017, and will be effective January 1, 2018. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station&#8217;s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage. 

A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station&#8217;s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station&#8217;s signal. 

MVPD operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute. 

In March 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing &#8220;good faith&#8221; retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-fo ur stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under the new rules, top-four stations may not (1) delegate author ity to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four station in the same DMA; or (2) facil itate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. This new rule took effect on June 18, 2014. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint ne gotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Retransmission consent agreements jointly negotiated prior to June 18, 2014 remain enforceable until the end of their current terms; however, contractual provisions between se parately owned top-four stations to consult or jointly negotiate retransmission consent agreements are now effectively void. Accordingly, in most markets the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmiss ion consent agreements with MVPDs. Concurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which seeks additional comment on the elimination or mo dification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. Comments and reply comments on the further notice were filed in the second and third quarters of 2014. 

In addition, in the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was adopted and signed into law in December 2014, the U.S. Congress directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to &#8220;review its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.&#8221; The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were filed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. We cannot predict the proceeding&#8217;s outcome.

The FCC&#8217;s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to &#8220;unserved&#8221; households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals. 

In addition, certain online video distributors and other over-the-top video distributors (&#8220;OTTDs&#8221;) have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OTTD&#8217;s transmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders&#8217; exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term &#8220;MVPD&#8221; to encompass OTTDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time, and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OTTDs. Comments and reply comments were filed in the first and second quarters of 2015.

The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of the stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations&#8217; signals.

Programming and Operation. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve &#8220;the public interest.&#8221; Since the late 1970s, the FCC gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station&#8217;s community of license. However, television station licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such r esponsiveness. The FCC may consider complaints from viewers concerning programming when it evaluates a station&#8217;s license renewal application, although viewer complaints also may be filed and considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must follow vari ous rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

political advertising (its price and availability); 

&#160;

&#9679; 

sponsorship identification; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

contest and lottery advertising; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

obscene and indecent broadcasts; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

discrimination and equal employment opportunities; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

closed captioning and video description; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

children&#8217;s programming; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

program ratings guidelines; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

network affiliation agreements. 

Technical Regulation . FCC rules govern the technical operating parameters of television stations, including permissible operating channel, power and antenna height and interference protections between stations. Under various FCC rules and procedures, full power television stations completed the transition from analog to digital television (DTV) broadcasting in June 2009. The FCC has adopted rules with respect to the final conversion of existing low power and television translator stations to digital operation, which must be completed within 51 months after the completion of the broadcast television incentive auction. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of 4,422 employees, comprised of 3,915 full-time and 507 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2015, 263 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
