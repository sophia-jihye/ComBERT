 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a biodefense company engaged in developing two next generation anthrax vaccines. The next generation vaccines are intended to have more rapid time to protection, fewer doses for protection and less stringent requirements for temperature controlled storage and handling than the currently used vaccine.

&#160;

Since 2006, we have been engaged in legal proceedings with SIGA. On December 23, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery's judgment against SIGA which provides an estimated total award of approximately $205 million plus interest. Additionally, if approved by the Bankruptcy Court, a reorganization plan filed by SIGA on December 15, 2015 and as amended on February 9, 2016 provides for SIGA to emerge from bankruptcy and provides for the final resolution of PharmAthene&#8217;s litigation claim against SIGA during 2016 or early 2017.

&#160;

During the first half of 2015 we narrowed the scope of our product development programs, reduced our employee headcount and executed other cost reductions. These actions were intended to allow the Company to have sufficient cash to recognize the benefit of the SIGA award and advance our Anthrax vaccine programs without the need to raise additional capital. During the second half of 2015 we focused our efforts on creating alternatives for settling the SIGA litigation claim and developing business plans around possible outcomes.

&#160;

The Company anticipates that eventual receipt of an award from SIGA could generate substantial taxable income to the Company, a portion of which can potentially be offset by the Company&#8217;s tax net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2015 we had available $156 million in accumulated losses available to offset income, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). On November 25, 2015, the Company adopted a Shareholders Rights Plan to help ensure that the NOLs remain available to help maximize the value for our shareholders of any amount received from the SIGA litigation.

&#160;

During 2016, we will continue to develop our plans to create shareholder value from the alternative SIGA litigation outcomes and will commence execution of those plans.

&#160;

Anthrax Vaccine Program Product Candidates 

&#160; 

During 2015, we terminated development of SparVax &#174; to focus our resources on development of two next generation Anthrax vaccines. SparVax &#174; was a liquid Recombinant Protective Antigen (&#8220;rPA&#8221;) anthrax vaccine designed to protect against inhalational anthrax, the most lethal form of B. anthracis infection in humans. Vaccination with SparVax &#174; can generate significant titers of antibodies and up to 100% protection in rabbits and non-human primates that are subsequently exposed to lethal inhalation doses of anthrax spores. SparVax &#174; human clinical studies involving over 770 individuals showed that it was generally well tolerated and immunogenic. Our next generation Anthrax vaccines use rPA, rPA manufacturing processes and development technologies produced in the SparVax &#174; program to develop vaccines intended to have significantly improved time to protection, dosing schedules, administration convenience and handling requirements compared to SparVax &#174;. 

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On September 9, 2014, we signed a contract with NIAID that funds the preclinical development of a next generation lyophilized anthrax vaccine based on the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology platform which contributes the rPA bulk drug substance that was used in the liquid SparVax &#174; formulation. Data generated to date demonstrates that our rPA can be stably formulated in a lyophilized state for room temperature storage. The next phase of the program is a demonstration of the final form of the vaccine in a single unit, dual-chambered syringe designed for simpler storage and ease of use. All of the necessary components of the vaccine will be contained in a single logistics transport and storage will be greatly improved. We expect to commence animal efficacy studies of the lyophilized vaccine in the second quarter of 2016, which if successful, can lead to our filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) in 2017 and commencement of a subsequent clinical trial.

&#160;

On July 6, 2015, we signed a license agreement with ImmunoVaccine Technologies (&#8220;IMV&#8221;) for the exclusive use of the DepoVax TM vaccine platform (&#8220;DPX&#8221;), to develop an anthrax vaccine utilizing PharmAthene&#8217;s rPA. Initial efficacy data generated using the DPX adjuvant with rPA indicates that the addition of DPX may reduce the number of doses required and shorten the time necessary for protection against an Anthrax challenge. The DPX adjuvant has recently been shown to be safe and effective in a human clinical trial for a Respiratory Syncytial Virus (&#8220;RSV&#8221;) vaccine based on the safety data released in October 2015 by IMV. We expect, based upon our preliminary research, but cannot guarantee, that our DPX rPA vaccine, once fully developed, will combine the proven safety and efficacy of the DPX adjuvant with the mature manufacturing of the rPA bulk drug substance, and facilitate the acceleration of our program through preclinical development and an IND filing with the FDA. We expect to file our IND with the FDA for the DPX rPA vaccine near the end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017.

&#160;

We intend to seek development partners to fund development and commercialization of our next generation anthrax vaccines.

&#160;

Stockholder Rights Plan to Preserve Value of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 

&#160;

On November 25, 2015, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan (&#8220;Rights Plan&#8221;) in an effort to preserve the value of its NOLs under Section 382 of the Code. The description and terms of the rights are set forth in a Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated as of November 25, 2015 (the &#8220;Section 382 Rights Agreement&#8221;), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, as Rights Agent.

&#160;

PharmAthene's use of its NOLs could be substantially limited if the Company experiences an &#34;ownership change&#34; as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative change in PharmAthene's ownership by 5% shareholders (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) that increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years on a rolling basis. The Rights Plan was adopted to reduce the likelihood of an unintended ownership change occurring.

&#160;

In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, on November 25, 2015 (the &#8220;Rights Dividend Declaration Date&#8221;), the Board declared a non-taxable dividend distribution of one share purchase right (&#8220;Right&#8221;) for each outstanding share of common stock to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 9, 2015. The Section 382 Rights Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person (an &#8220;Acquiring Person&#8221;) acquiring (together with all affiliates and associates of such person) beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, without the approval of the Board of Directors. Stockholders who beneficially owned 4.99% or more of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock as of the Rights Dividend Declaration Date are not be deemed to be an Acquiring Person, but such person will be deemed an Acquiring Person if such person (together with all affiliates and associates of such person) becomes the beneficial owner of securities representing a percentage of the Company&#8217;s common stock that exceeds by 0.5% or more the lowest percentage of beneficial ownership of the Company&#8217;s common stock that such person had at any time since the Rights Dividend Declaration Date. In its discretion, the Board may exempt certain persons whose acquisition of securities is determined by the Board not to jeopardize the availability to the Company's NOLs or other tax benefits and may also exempt certain transactions.

&#160;

Subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Section 382 Rights Agreement, if the Rights become exercisable, each Right would initially represent the right to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company&#8217;s Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for a purchase price of $6.00 per Right (the &#8220;Purchase Price&#8221;). If issued, each fractional share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock would give the stockholder approximately the same dividend, voting and liquidation rights as does one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock. However, prior to exercise, a Right does not give its holder any rights as a stockholder of the Company, including any dividend, voting or liquidation rights.

&#160;

The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) the close of business on November 25, 2018, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged under the Rights Plan, (iii) the repeal of Section 382 or any successor statute and the Board's determination that the Rights Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company's NOLs or (iv) the beginning of a taxable year of the Company in which the Board determines that no NOLs may be carried forward.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The issuance of the Rights is not a taxable event and will not affect the Company's reported financial condition or results of operations, including earnings per share. Additional information regarding the Rights Plan is contained in the Company&#8217;s current report on Form 8-K, filed on November 25, 2015.

&#160;

SIGA Litigation 

&#160;

In December 2006, we filed a complaint against SIGA in the Delaware Court of Chancery . The complaint alleged, among other things, that we have the right to license exclusively the development and marketing rights for SIGA&#8217;s drug candidate, Tecovirimat, also known as ST-246 &#174; , pursuant to a merger agreement between the parties that was terminated in 2006 . The complaint also alleged that SIGA failed to negotiate in good faith the terms of such a license pursuant to the terminated merger agreement with us.

&#160;

In September 2014, SIGA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#34;Bankruptcy Court&#34;). SIGA&#8217;s petition for bankruptcy initiated a process whereby its assets are protected from creditors, including PharmAthene.

&#160;

In January 2015, after years of litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a final order and judgment, or the Judgment, finding that we are entitled to receive a lump sum award of $194.6 million, or the Total Judgment, comprised of (1) expectation damages of $113.1 million for the value of the Company&#8217;s lost profits for Tecovirimat, plus (2) pre-judgment interest on that amount from 2006 and varying percentages of the Company&#8217;s reasonable attorneys&#8217; and expert witness fees totaling $81.5 million. Under the Final Order and Judgment, PharmAthene is also entitled to post-judgment simple interest.

&#160;

On December 15, 2015, SIGA filed a reorganization plan, amended on February 9, 2016 (the &#34;Plan&#34;) with the Bankruptcy Court that provides for among other things, the process by which SIGA may emerge from bankruptcy, which includes the process by which PharmAthene's Judgment will be satisfied. The Plan remains subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and therefore remains subject to change, withdrawal or rejection by either SIGA or the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan provides generally that PharmAthene will receive, in full settlement and satisfaction of its claim, no later than 120 days plus another potential 90 days after the Delaware Supreme Court affirms a final order, one of the following, determined in SIGA&#8217;s sole discretion:

&#160;

(i) payment in full in cash of the unpaid balance of the PharmAthene claim plus interest which after plan approval shall accrue at a rate of 8.75%; &#160;

(ii) delivery to PharmAthene of 100% of SIGA&#8217;s common stock; or &#160;

(iii) such other treatment as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by SIGA and PharmAthene and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. &#160;

SIGA has a 120-day period (plus a 90-day extension if exercised and the conditions to such extension are met) during which it must satisfy PharmAthene's claim according to one of the above alternatives. The beginning of that 120-day period depends upon whether SIGA files timely a Petition for Certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. If SIGA does not timely petition the U.S. Supreme Court, the 120-day period commences after March 22, 2016, which is 90 days after the Delaware Supreme Court ruling. If SIGA does timely petition the U.S. Supreme Court, the 120-day period commences when such petition is denied or that process results in a final order granting PharmAthene a claim.

&#160;

Under the Plan, SIGA will pay $5 million to PharmAthene upon plan approval. It would also pay PharmAthene $20 million if it petitions the U.S. Supreme Court for Certiorari and an additional $20 million if it decides to extend the 120 period by an additional 90 days. The payments are creditable against the final judgment and are not refundable.

&#160;

The description of the Plan provided above is a brief summary of the Plan, which includes numerous other conditions and substantive provisions relating to the operation of the business of SIGA. Copies of the Plan are available from the Bankruptcy Court. For a description of risks related to our ability to recognize value relating to this litigation, see the &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section of this annual report below.

&#160;

On December 23, 2015, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Delaware Court of Chancery's Judgment as a result of which, with additional post-judgment interest, if calculated based on the original decision, would provide for an estimated total award of approximately $205 million. However, PharmAthene&#8217;s entitlement to interest from and after SIGA&#8217;s bankruptcy filing may be negatively impacted by the proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There can be no assurances if and when the Company will receive any payments from SIGA as a result of the Judgment. SIGA has indicated in filings with the Bankruptcy Court that it does not currently have cash sufficient to satisfy the award. It is also uncertain whether SIGA will have such cash in the future. PharmAthene&#8217;s ability to collect the Judgment depends upon a number of factors, including SIGA&#8217;s financial and operational success, which is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties (certain of which are outlined in SIGA&#8217;s filings with the SEC), as to which we have limited knowledge and which we have no ability to control, mitigate or fully evaluate. Furthermore, because SIGA has filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, PharmAthene is automatically stayed from taking any enforcement action in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Company&#8217;s ability to collect a money judgment from SIGA remains subject to further proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court.

&#160;

Post-SIGA Payment Plans :

&#160;

In the event that SIGA pays PharmAthene cash in full and barring any unexpected material events, PharmAthene currently expects that it will distribute at least 90% of the after tax net cash proceeds to its shareholders. The timing and form of distribution will depend upon the Company's analysis of the Company's current situation, applicable corporate statutes relating to distributions and the economic consequences to the shareholders. After distribution of these cash proceeds, we intend to seek an M&#38;A transaction to maximize the value of the Company's remaining assets and anthrax vaccine programs.

&#160;

The Company will develop a transition plan and strategy for operating SIGA as a separate business in the event SIGA chooses to settle our claim by turning over 100% of its common stock to the Company.

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

We have been engaged in the biodefense business through our predecessor entity since our inception in 2001. Our subsidiary PharmAthene Canada, Inc. was operated in support of the Protexia &#174; contract with the U.S. Army Space and Missile Command issued to develop a nerve agent counter measure. In July 2012, we substantially liquidated our Canadian subsidiary, which we acquired in 2005. All assets in Canada have been disposed of. In March 2008, PharmAthene, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary PharmAthene UK Limited, acquired from Avecia Biologics Limited the rights to develop SparVax &#174; . In 2009, the contract was novated from PharmAthene UK Limited to PharmAthene, Inc. In June 2015, we substantially completed the liquidation of PharmAthene UK Limited.

&#160;

We are a Delaware corporation with executive offices located at One Park Place, Suite 450, Annapolis, Maryland 21401 and our telephone number is 410-269-2600. Our common stock trades on the NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex) under the symbol &#8220;PIP.&#8221; We maintain a website at http://www.PharmAthene.com . The information contained on or connected to our website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this annual report. We make available for download free of charge through our website this annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed, or furnished, them to the SEC.

&#160;

U.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will have a significant impact on our research, product development, manufacturing and marketing of any biopharmaceutical products. The nature and the extent to which regulations apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such products. Our potential biopharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The products we are developing are subject to federal regulation in the United States, principally by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act and Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and by state and local governments, as well as regulatory and other authorities in foreign governments that include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures. Such regulations govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety and efficacy requirements, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, licensing, advertising, promotion, distribution and export of products, manufacturing and the manufacturing process. In many foreign countries, such regulations also govern the prices charged for products under their respective national social security systems and availability to consumers.

&#160;

The Public Health Service Act classifies our current drug candidates which are produced using biological systems, as biological drug products, or Biologics. All drugs intended for human use, including Biologics, are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The steps ordinarily required by the FDA before a biological drug product may be marketed in the United States are similar to steps required in most other countries and include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal testing and formulation studies; &#160;

&#183; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before clinical trials may commence; &#160;

&#183; submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) that includes preclinical data, clinical trial data, product composition and formulation information, and manufacturing information; &#160;

&#183; FDA review of the BLA; &#160;

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities; and &#160;

&#183; FDA approval of the BLA, including approval of all product labeling. &#160; 

The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and approvals may not be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all.

&#160;

Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations to characterize the product&#8217;s composition, impurities, stability, and mechanism of its biologic effect, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, purity and potency of each product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the tests, requiring such tests to be repeated and delaying approval of the BLA. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND by placing the study on clinical hold, the IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA may authorize trials only on specified terms and may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. If the FDA places a study on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve all of the FDA&#8217;s concerns and have the FDA lift the clinical hold, before the study may proceed. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of products. Similar restrictive requirements also apply in other countries. Additionally, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, and requires the patients&#8217; informed consent. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possibility of liability of the institutions conducting the trial. The IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a belief that the test subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Since our products are being developed using funding from the U.S. Government, additional review by either the NIH&#8217;s IRB or the DoD&#8217;s IRB-equivalent may also be required. These reviews take place following approval by the independent IRB. As the sponsor, we can also suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time.

&#160;

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, Phases 1, 2, and 3, involving an increasing number of human subjects. These phases may sometimes overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials are performed in a small number of healthy human subjects or subjects with the targeted condition, and involve testing for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion or immunogenicity for vaccine products. Phase 2 studies, which may involve up to hundreds of subjects, seek to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, preliminary information related to the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage. Finally, Phase 3 trials may involve up to thousands of individuals often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to provide the documentation of effectiveness and important additional safety data required for licensing. Prior to commencing Phase 3 clinical trials many sponsors elect to meet with FDA officials to discuss the conduct and design of the proposed trial or trials.

&#160;

In addition, federal law requires the listing, on a publicly-available website, of detailed information on clinical trials for investigational drugs. Some states have similar or supplemental clinical trial reporting laws.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In 2002, the FDA amended its requirements applicable to BLAs to permit the approval of certain Biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, also known as the Animal Rule, and published in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 601 Subpart H), authorize the FDA to rely on evidence from animal studies to provide evidence of a product&#8217;s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the toxicity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with FDA&#8217;s prior agreement, Biologics used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated for effectiveness under this rule are evaluated for safety under pre-existing requirements for establishing the safety of new drug and biological products, including Phase 1 through Phase 2 clinical trials. Under certain circumstances a single animal species may be acceptable if that animal model is sufficiently well-characterized for predicting a response in humans. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing and distribution and requirements to provide information to patients.

&#160;

We will rely on the Animal Rule for our product candidates because we cannot ethically expose humans to anthrax. Other countries do not, at this time, have established criteria for review and approval of these types of products outside their normal review process, i.e., there is no Animal Rule equivalent in countries other than the United States.

&#160;

Success in early-stage animal studies and clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from animal studies and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval.

&#160;

All data obtained from the preclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, would be submitted in a BLA to the FDA for review and approval for the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipments of any of our products. FDA approval of the BLA is required before commercial marketing or non-investigational interstate shipment may begin in the United States. The FDA may also conduct an audit of the clinical trial data used to support the BLA.

&#160;

However, under Project BioShield, the Secretary of DHHS may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and upon the approval of the President, contract to purchase unapproved counter measures for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, in specified circumstances. The U.S. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a stockpile purchase after Presidential approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the counter measure to the SNS is paid on delivery and acceptance of a substantial portion of the counter measure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of DHHS must determine that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from preclinical and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the counter measure will qualify for approval or licensing within eight years. The legislation also allows unlicensed products to be procured for the SNS so that they are available at the time an emergency is declared.

&#160;

Project BioShield also allows the Secretary of DHHS to authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA. To exercise this authority, the Secretary of DHHS must conclude that:

&#160;

&#183; the agent for which the counter measure is designed can cause serious or life-threatening disease; &#160;

&#183; the product may reasonably be believed to be effective in detecting, diagnosing, treating or preventing the disease; &#160;

&#183; the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh its known and potential risks; and &#160;

&#183; there is no adequate alternative to the product that is approved and available. &#160;

Although this provision permits the Secretary of DHHS to circumvent the FDA approval process, its use would be limited to rare circumstances.

&#160; 

We believe our products would be eligible both for consideration for procurement into the SNS and for use in the event of an emergency, although there is no guarantee that our products would meet the criteria set forth by DHHS or the FDA for procurement and Emergency Use Authorization, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With regard to a BLA, the FDA may deny or delay approval of an application that does not meet applicable regulatory criteria, e.g., if the FDA determines that the preclinical or clinical data or the manufacturing information does not adequately establish the safety, purity and potency (including efficacy) of the Biologic. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant&#8217;s interpretation of the data submitted in its BLA. The FDA can request additional information, seek clarification regarding information already provided in the submission or ask that additional clinical trials be conducted, all of which can delay approval. The FDA also may, at any time, require the submission of product samples and testing protocols for lot-by-lot confirmatory review or testing, known as lot release, by the FDA prior to commercial distribution. This means a specific lot of Biologic cannot be released for commercial distribution until the FDA has authorized such release. Similar types of regulatory processes will be encountered as efforts are made to market any Biologic internationally. We will be required to assure product performance and manufacturing processes from one country to another.

&#160;

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that contraindications, warning statements or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval or limit labeling. Once it approves a BLA, the FDA may revoke or suspend the product approval if compliance with post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-market studies. The Animal Rule requires post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the product&#8217;s clinical benefit and assess its safety should an exigency exist that leads to the product being used in humans; the nature of these studies will be discussed with FDA as part of the BLA process. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil and criminal penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and revoke approvals.

&#160;

Biologics manufacturers, distributors and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections, or inspections &#8220;for cause&#8221; by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, the FDA&#8217;s general biological product standards, and the product establishment standards set forth in the approved BLA. The cGMP requirements for biological products in particular are extensive and compliance with them requires considerable time, resources and ongoing investment. The regulations require manufacturers to establish validated systems to ensure that products meet high standards of sterility, purity and potency. The requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the synthesis, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the biological product. For all drugs and biological products, the regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose documentation requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers that it may decide to use. Manufacturing establishments are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with all cGMP requirements. The FDA is authorized to inspect manufacturing facilities without a warrant at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

&#160;

We, or our present or future suppliers, may not be able to comply with cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as a delay or refusal to approve a BLA, suspension of manufacturing, seizure or recall of a product, or civil or criminal prosecution of the company or individual officers or employees.

&#160; 

Post-Marketing Regulation 

&#160;

Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA licenses or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including but not limited to:

&#160;

&#183; recordkeeping requirements; &#160;

&#183; periodic reporting requirements; &#160;

&#183; cGMP requirements related to all stages of manufacturing, testing, storage, packaging, labeling and distribution of finished dosage forms of the product; &#160;

&#183; reporting of adverse experiences with the product; and &#160;

&#183; advertising and promotion restrictions and enforcement actions. &#160;

Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes, recalls, or withdrawal of product approval. Product approvals may be revoked if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or effectiveness of the product occur following approval. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor a product&#8217;s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of a product.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote Biologics, including, among others, standards and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in administrative and judicial enforcement actions, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing correction of deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. Foreign regulatory bodies also strictly enforce these and other regulatory requirements and drug marketing may be prohibited in whole or in part in other countries.

&#160;

We, our collaborators or our third party contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable regulations. After regulatory approvals are obtained, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems, or the failure to maintain compliance with existing or new regulatory requirements, may result in:

&#160;

&#183; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product; &#160;

&#183; Warning Letters or Untitled Letters from the FDA asking us, our collaborators or third party contractors to take or refrain from taking certain actions; &#160;

&#183; withdrawal of the product from the market; &#160;

&#183; FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; &#160;

&#183; voluntary or mandatory product recall; &#160;

&#183; fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue; &#160;

&#183; suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; &#160;

&#183; product seizure; and &#160;

&#183; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

In addition to the substantial regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our various activities. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action.

&#160;

Changing Legal and Regulatory Landscape 

&#160; 

Periodically legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, including biological products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. We cannot predict whether or when legislation impacting our business will be enacted, what FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations may change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be in the future.

&#160;

Process and Analytical Development, and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We have no drug substance or drug product development, analytical or manufacturing facilities of our own, and have been relying on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROs. CMOs have experience in developing biological manufacturing processes and operating under cGMPs established by the Code of Federal Regulations and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Biologics) regulated by the FDA, and we rely on them for clinical and future commercial production of our product candidates. CROs provide cGLP/cGMP-compliant services for product analytical tests.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Certain raw materials used in producing our product candidates are available from only one source or a limited number of sources. We attempt to mitigate the risk associated with such sole source raw materials by actively managing our supplies. We have not experienced any shortages in supplies of such raw materials. Unavailability of certain materials or the loss of current sources of production could cause an interruption in production on a temporary basis pending establishment of new sources or, in some cases, implementation of alternative processes.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Part of our value depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business.

&#160;

The following table identifies each of our material issued and non-abandoned patents and published pending applications, in order of importance to us:

In addition, we are a party to various exclusive and non-exclusive licenses, which provide access to intellectual property and know-how useful for our products. Some of our licenses, which generally extend for the life of any applicable patent, require us to pay royalties on sales of products that may be derived from or produced using the licensed technology. For additional information on our license agreements, please refer to Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies - License Agreements in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

We currently own no material trademarks.

&#160;

We have relied upon certain proprietary trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop a competitive position. In efforts to maintain confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets, proprietary information and developments, all of our employees are required to execute agreements regarding confidentiality and assign to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us. We may in the future use license agreements to access external products and technologies as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. A large number of companies of all sizes engage in activities similar to our activities and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them.

&#160; 

Anthrax Product Competition 

&#160;

In the anthrax vaccine field there is only one FDA licensed anthrax vaccine, Biothrax &#174; , which is sold by Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. With respect to the development of a next generation recombinant PA-based vaccine, we are aware of four other companies developing competing vaccines that are in the clinical stages of development: Emergent BioSolutions, Inc., Green Cross, Panacea Biotec Ltd., and PaxVax. There are a number of companies with anthrax vaccines in preclinical development including, but not limited to, Bavarian Nordic, IBio, Pfenex, Soligenix and Vaxin and there may be other companies developing competing vaccines that we are not aware of.

&#160;

U.S. Government Contracts 

&#160;

Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from grants and U.S. Government contracts. There can be no assurances that our remaining U.S. Government contract will be continued, renewed beyond the base period, or that we can enter into new contracts or receive new grants to supply the U.S. or other governments with our products. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain.

&#160;

U.S. Government contracts typically are subject to audit by the government and contain termination provisions for the government allowing it to terminate at its discretion, which subjects us to additional risks. These risks include the ability of the U.S. Government unilaterally to:

&#160;

&#183; preclude us, either temporarily or for a set period of time, from receiving new contracts or extending our remaining contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations; &#160;

&#183; terminate our remaining contracts either for the convenience of the government (at the government&#8217;s sole discretion, for example, if funds become unavailable or the government no longer wants the work) or for default (for failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms); &#160;

&#183; revise the scope and value of our contracts and/or the timing for work to be performed; &#160;

&#183; audit and object to our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; &#160;

&#183; control and potentially prohibit the export of our products; &#160;

&#183; claim rights to intellectual property, including our products, developed under the contract; &#160;

&#183; add or remove the terms and conditions in our contracts; and &#160;

&#183; cancel or amend planned procurements, including outstanding RFP solicitations. &#160;

Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 11 persons, including five 5 individuals engaged in research and development activities and 6 individuals engaged in general and administrative functions, such as human resources, finance and accounting. None of our employees are party to any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

&#160;
