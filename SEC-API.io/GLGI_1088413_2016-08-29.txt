Organization 

&#160; 

Greystone Logistics, Inc. (&#8220;Greystone&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on February 24, 1969, under the name Permaspray Manufacturing Corporation. It subsequently changed its name to Browning Enterprises Inc. in April 1982, to Cabec Energy Corp. in June 1993, to PalWeb Corporation in April 1999 and to Greystone Logistics, Inc. in March 2005, as further described below. In December 1997, Greystone acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Plastic Pallet Production, Inc., a Texas corporation (&#8220;PPP&#8221;), and since that time, Greystone has primarily been engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling plastic pallets. 

&#160; 

Effective September 8, 2003, Greystone acquired substantially all of the assets of Greystone Plastics, Inc., an Iowa corporation, through the purchase of such assets by Greystone&#8217;s newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, Greystone Manufacturing, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability company (&#8220;GSM&#8221;). Greystone Plastics, Inc. was a manufacturer of plastic pallets used in the beverage industry. 

&#160; 

Effective March 18, 2005, Greystone caused its newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Greystone Logistics, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, to be merged with and into Greystone. In connection with such merger and as of the effective time of the merger, Greystone amended its certificate of incorporation by changing its name from PalWeb Corporation to Greystone Logistics, Inc., pursuant to the terms of the certificate of ownership and merger filed by Greystone with the Secretary of State of Oklahoma. 

&#160; 

Current Business 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Greystone&#8217;s primary business is the manufacturing of plastic pallets utilizing recycled plastic and selling the pallets through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, GSM. Greystone sells its pallets through a network of independent contractor distributors and direct sales by its president and other employees. As of May 31, 2016, Greystone had an aggregate in-house production capacity of approximately 85,000 pallets per month for its medium and heavy-duty pallets and 20,000 for its lightweight nestable pallets. 

&#160; 

Greystone&#8217;s product line as of May 31, 2016 consists of the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 37&#8221; X 32&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; 40&#8221; X 32&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#9679; 37&#8221; X 37&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#9679; 44&#8221; X 56&#8221; can pallet, &#160; &#9679; 48&#8221; X 48&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#9679; 48&#8221; X 40&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; 48&#8221; X 44&#8221; rackable pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; 48&#8221; X 40&#8221; nestable pallet, &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; 24&#8221;X 40&#8221; display pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; 48&#8221;X 40&#8221; monoblock (one-piece) pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; Half-barrel keg stackable pallet, &#160; &#160; &#9679; Slim keg stackable pallet, and &#160; &#160; &#9679; 36&#8221;X 36&#8221; rackable pallet. &#160; 

The principal raw materials used in manufacturing Greystone&#8217;s plastic pallets are in abundant supply, and some of these materials may be obtained from recycled plastic containers. At the present time, these materials are being purchased from local, national and international suppliers. 

&#160; 

Other Business 

&#160; 

Greystone processes recycled plastic into pellet form which may be sold or used in Greystone&#8217;s production of pallets. The sale of pelletized resin is dependent on Greystone&#8217;s ability to realize reasonable profit, which is generally based on market conditions. Greystone also provides tolling services whereby it grinds and pelletizes a customer&#8217;s plastic material for a fee. 

&#160; 

Pallet Industry 

&#160; 

Pallets are devices used for moving and storing freight. A pallet is used as a base for assembling, storing, stacking, handling, and transporting goods as a unit load. A pallet is constructed to facilitate the placement of a lift truck&#8217;s forks between the levels of a platform so it may be moved easily. 

&#160; 

Pallets are used worldwide for the transportation of goods and they are primarily made of wood. There are an estimated 1.9 to 2.0 billion pallets in circulation daily in the United States (an estimated 97% wood pallets and 3% plastic or other pallets). In 2004, the William H. Sardo Jr. Pallet and Container Research Laboratory at Virginia Tech University, under the direction of Dr. Marshall S. &#8220;Mark&#8221; White, estimated total pallet annual production in the United States at 814 million broken down as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 500 million new wood pallets &#160; &#160; &#9679; 300 million repaired and used wood pallets &#160; &#9679; 8.3 million plastic pallets &#160; &#9679; 5.5 million corrugated paperboard pallets &#160; &#9679; 1.1 million metal pallets &#160; 

According to the National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA), approximately 4.5 billion board feet of hardwood lumber is used annually for containers and pallets, which is almost 40% of all hardwood produced in the U.S. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, deforestation is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide gas emissions. Deforestation leads to CO2 emissions because the carbon sequestered in trees is emitted into the atmosphere and not counter-balanced by re-growth of new trees. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A wood container and pallet manufacturing industry report by Supplier Relations US estimated revenue for the year 2009 was approximately $6.7 billion with a gross profit of 21.11%. The wood pallet and container industry is by no means concentrated, with roughly 2,500 &#8211; 3,000 pallet manufacturers and recyclers in operation. The estimated breakdown of wood pallet manufacturers is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 44% manufacture new pallets only &#160; &#9679; 47% manufacture new pallets and recovered use allets (repair) &#160; &#9679; 9% manufacture recovered use pallets only &#160; 

Estimates of wood pallet manufacturing industry capacity utilization was at less than 60% in 2000 (Source: Sardo Laboratory). According to the 2007 Economic Census, wood pallet and container manufacturers are rather small, totaling just 2,638 companies with a total of 58,467 employees. Only 65 of these companies reported more than 100 employees and more than 2,000 of these companies reported less than 20 employees. A typical company in this sector has only one establishment. Capital investment in the industry was estimated in 2007 at $238.5 billion. Recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics also reports the value of shipments has increased almost 45% over the period from 2000 &#8211; 2008, or at an annual growth of 5%. 

&#160; 

IBIS World forecasts modest industry growth over the next few years with little change in industry structure. Greystone believes that a gradual shifting from wood pallets to plastic pallets will take place over time. Because of the lack of concentration among wood pallet manufacturers, there is a lesser risk of coordinated response (price, performance) against the penetration of plastic pallets. Wood is also a resource which faces environmental pressures (logging issues) as well as possible substantial overseas demand (China). A Freedonia Group industrial research report estimates that the U.S. demand for plastic pallets will grow to $982 million by 2017 as compared to $655 million in 2012. 

&#160; 

The largest industry users of pallets such as the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, beverage and dairy industries are populated with large public or private entities for which profitable financial performance is paramount. The operating issues presented by wood pallets have been tolerated to date as there has been no viable alternative in sufficient size for replacement. 

&#160; 

Types of Pallets 

&#160; 

There are over 400 different pallet sizes used by companies in the United States. Some of the most common sizes used in the U.S. according to the American National Standard/MH1 (2005) are listed below: 

&#160; 

Pallet Type &#160; Pallet Size &#160; Share of Annual 

Production (%) 

&#160; Grocery &#160; 48 X 40&#8221; &#160; &#160; 30.0 &#160; Chemical &#160; 42 X 42&#8221; &#160; &#160; 5.7 &#160; Military &#160; 40 X 48&#8221; &#160; &#160; 4.0 &#160; Beverage &#160; 36 X 36&#8221; &#160; &#160; 3.0 &#160; Dairy &#160; 40 X 40&#8221; &#160; &#160; 3.0 &#160; &#160; 

The most common size pallet is the 48 x 40&#8221; 4-way pallet or otherwise referred to as the GMA (Grocery Manufacturer Association) pallet, sometimes known in the industry as the &#8220;GMA Pallet,&#8221; &#8220;The GMA Pallet,&#8221; &#8220;GMA 48 x 40 Pallet,&#8221; or &#8220;GMA Block Pallet.&#8221; The GMA acts as a commodity in the pallet industry, as price is often determined by availability. As wood pallets move through their life cycle from a new pallet to a used pallet, they are repaired and put back in service until they are land filled or used as wood compost. 

&#160; 

Pallets are the primary interface between the packaged product and today&#8217;s highly automated material handling equipment. Currently, approximately 90% of the U.S. domestic product is shipped on pallets. Although pallets are not the most glamorous part of the warehouse, they are important because users have expectations based on specifications and wood pallets lack critical manufacturing details that determine performance. The end user becomes frustrated when these pallets do not perform to expectation. Shipments can be damaged or rejected entirely resulting in significant product and revenue losses. This angst is aggravated when new multi-million dollar automated systems are in use. 

&#160; 

During the past two decades both timber prices and landfill fees have increased and have compelled businesses to modify the way pallets are managed. Businesses can evaluate and improve their pallet management systems and reduce associated waste by utilizing plastic recycled pallets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Greystone&#8217;s management believes that the trend will continue to switch from wood to plastic, with the only limiting factor being price. Greystone intends to continue to conduct research on pallet design strength and coefficient of friction and the materials used to make the plastic pallets as required to meet market demands and improve its existing products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of May 31, 2016, Greystone had 183 full-time employees and used a temporary personnel service to provide additional production personnel as needed. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Customers 

&#160; 

Greystone&#8217;s primary focus is to provide quality plastic pallets to its existing customers while continuing its marketing efforts to broaden its customer base. Greystone&#8217;s existing customers are primarily located in the United States and engaged in the beverage, pharmaceutical and other industries. Greystone has generated and plans to continue to generate interest in its pallets by attending trade shows sponsored by industry segments that would benefit from Greystone&#8217;s products. Greystone hopes to gain wider product acceptance by marketing the concept that the widespread use of plastic pallets could greatly reduce the destruction of trees on a worldwide basis. Greystone sells to customers through contract distributors or by direct contract through its President and other employees. 

&#160; 

Greystone derives a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer. This customer accounted for approximately 41% and 51% of total sales in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The design of Greystone&#8217;s recycled plastic pallets are approved for use by the customer and are the only plastic pallets in use for its case goods and kegs. There is no assurance that Greystone will retain this customer&#8217;s business at the same level, or at all. The loss of a material amount of business from this customer could have a material adverse effect on Greystone. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Greystone&#8217;s primary competitors are a large number of small, privately held firms that sell wood pallets in very limited geographic locations. Greystone believes that it can compete with manufacturers of wood pallets by emphasizing the cost savings realized over the longer life of its plastic pallets as well as the environmental benefits of its plastic pallets as compared to wood pallets. Greystone also competes with three large and approximately ten small manufacturers of plastic pallets. Some of Greystone&#8217;s competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than Greystone and, therefore, may be able to commit greater resources than Greystone in such areas of product development, manufacturing and marketing. However, Greystone believes that its proprietary designs coupled with the competitive pricing of its products gives Greystone a competitive advantage over other plastic pallet manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The business operations of Greystone are subject to existing and potential federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. In addition, both the plastics industry and Greystone are subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid wastes by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees and limits on the use of plastic products. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

Greystone seeks to protect its technical advances by pursuing national and international patent protection for its products and methods when appropriate.
