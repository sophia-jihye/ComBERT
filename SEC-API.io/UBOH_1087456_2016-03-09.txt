&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Corporation competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as shares in money market mutual funds. Primary factors in competing for deposits include customer service, interest rates and convenience. In making loans, the Corporation competes with other commercial banks, savings associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies, mortgage companies and other lenders. Competition is affected by, among other things, the general availability of lendable funds, general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily predictable. The financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences in the regions that we operate.

&#160;

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on our core banking products and services. Consolidation continued during 2015, primarily through private merger and acquisition transactions, and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to other financial institutions. We expect this trend to continue during 2016, due primarily to increased compliance costs. We, therefore, expect competition in the markets we serve to intensify with the advent of new technology and consolidation trends. As a matter of course, we continue to evaluate opportunities in the markets we serve or contiguous markets to improve our footprint, while balancing the efficiency of technology.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

The following discussion addresses the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, like UBOH, and our subsidiary bank, Union Bank. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC, and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors. We cannot predict changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

UBOH 

&#160;

As a bank holding company, UBOH is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. Pursuant to the BHCA, bank holding companies generally may not, in general, directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank or savings association, without prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities.

&#160;

Under federal law, a bank holding company, like UBOH, must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance to them in the event of their financial distress. This support may be required when we do not have the resources to, or would prefer not to, provide it. Certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bank holding company, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

&#160;

Union Bank 

&#160;

As an Ohio state-chartered bank, and a member of the DIF, administered by the FDIC, Union Bank is supervised and regulated by the Division and the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and conducts examinations of and requires reporting by FDIC-insured institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;).

&#160;

Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of Ohio affect the operations of Union Bank, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans which may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, and limitations on branching.

&#160;

As a member of the FHLB, Union Bank is required to, among other things, maintain an investment in capital stock of the FHLB. Union Bank receives dividends on its investment in FHLB stock. Under certain conditions, secured advances to Union Bank are available from the FHLB to meet operational requirements. Such advances are renewable and can be obtained up to specified dollar amounts. These advances are secured primarily by Union Bank&#8217;s eligible mortgage loans and FHLB stock.

&#160;

&#160;

Regulatory capital and liquidity 

&#160;

Current regulatory capital requirements 

&#160;

Federal banking regulators have promulgated risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to UBOH and Union Bank. The adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by federal banking agencies in their examination and supervision processes, and in the evaluation of applications in connection with certain expansion activities.

&#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking regulators and effective through December 31, 2015, include both a definition and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. The minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least 4% is to be comprised of common shareholders&#8217; equity (including retained earnings but excluding treasury stock), noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (&#8220;Tier 1 capital&#8221;). The remainder (&#8220;Tier 2 capital&#8221;) may consist, among other things, of mandatory convertible debt securities, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses. Each of the federal banking agencies also impose a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) for banking organizations. The minimum leverage ratio is currently 3% for bank holding companies that are considered &#8220;strong&#8221; under the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s guidelines or which have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s risk-based capital measure for market risk. The minimum leverage ratio is 1%-2% higher for other bank holding companies and banks based on their particular circumstances and risk profiles and for those banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth. The FDIC imposes similar capital requirements on Union Bank adopted by the FDIC.

&#160;

The Corporation currently satisfies all capital requirements. Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal and state regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued in 2003 and the trust preferred securities from The Ohio State Bank acquisition, as described in Note 10 in the consolidated financial statements contained in the Corporation&#8217;s Annual Report, currently qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. However, it is possible that regulations could change so that such securities do not qualify.

&#160;

The federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks. Under these regulations, institutions, which become undercapitalized, become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations that increase as capital decreases. Such institutions are also required to file capital plans with their primary federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes undercapitalized.

&#160;

The ability of a bank holding company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by its subsidiary bank and other subsidiaries. However, the Federal Reserve Board expects the Corporation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank, which may require it to retain capital for further investment in the subsidiary, rather than for dividends for shareholders of UBOH. The Bank may not pay dividends to UBOH if, after paying such dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Bank must have the approval of its regulatory authorities if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of the current year&#8217;s net income and the retained net income for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus. Payment of dividends by a bank subsidiary may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice. These provisions could have the effect of limiting UBOH&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares.

&#160;

The FDIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to an FDIC-insured depository institution that does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Banks and savings associations are classified into one (1) of five (5) categories based upon capital adequacy, ranging from &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; to &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions begin to apply at &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; status and become progressively stricter as the insured depository institutions approaches &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; status. Generally, the regulations require the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; and to take additional actions if the institution becomes &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Under the Prompt Corrective Action requirements effective through December 31, 2015, a depository institution is considered well-capitalized if it maintains total risk-based capital of greater than or equal to 10%; tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 6%; and a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. As of December 31, 2015, Union Bank has total risk-based capital of 16.8%, tier 1 risk-based capital and CET 1 capital of 15.9%, and tier 1 leverage of 11.8%. Effective January 1, 2015, final rules promulgated by the FDIC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, provide that for a depository institution to be considered well-capitalized it must maintain common equity tier 1 capital of at least 6.5%; tier 1 risk-based capital of at least 8%; total risk-based capital of at least 10%; and leverage ratio of at least 5%. While the Prompt Corrective Action requirements only apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to bank holding companies, the mandatory Prompt Corrective Action &#8220;capital restoration plan&#8221; required of an undercapitalized institution by its relevant regulator must be guaranteed to a limited extent by the institution&#8217;s parent bank holding company.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the &#8220;Regulatory Capital Rules&#8221;). The Regulatory Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standard as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The implementation of the Regulatory Capital Rules will lead to higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage liquidity ratios than those currently in place. In addition, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, such as dividend payments and certain bonus payments to executive officers, the Regulatory Capital Rules require insured financial institutions to hold a capital conservation buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in over time, beginning January 1, 2016, for non-advanced approach institutions, like Union Bank and UBOH, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules also revise the regulatory agencies&#8217; prompt corrective action framework by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of common equity. The Regulatory Capital Rules phase in beginning January 1, 2015, for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, like UBOH and Union Bank, and January 1, 2014, for advanced approach banking organizations, and will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Until the rules are fully phased in, we cannot predict the ultimate impact they will have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation.

&#160;

Federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiary (like Union Bank). Historically, dividends paid by Union Bank have been an important source of cash flow for UBOH to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Dividends by our bank subsidiary are limited to the lessor of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, without the prior approval of the FDIC, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year&#8217;s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank&#8217;s undivided profits. Moreover, under the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be in a less than &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; prompt corrective action capital category or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. For more information about the payment of dividends by Union Bank to UBOH, please see Note 15 in this report.

&#160;

FDIA and Resolution Authority 

&#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance Act 

&#160;

The FDIC&#8217;s DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which insurance is funded through assessments on banks, like Union Bank. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased to $250,000 per depositor. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (the &#8220;DRR&#8221;), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to amend its assessment regulations so that future assessments will generally be based upon a depository institution&#8217;s average total consolidated assets minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, whereas assessments were previously based on the amount of an institution&#8217;s insured deposits. The minimum DIF rate will increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.

&#160;

Conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed as receiver or, in rare circumstances, conservator for the insolvent institution under the FDIA. In an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institution&#8217;s affairs. If the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership (or conservatorship) for breach of contract, the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon, among other factors, the receivership assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others. In addition, the FDIC may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution, notwithstanding any provision that would terminate, cause a default, accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency, the appointment of the receiver (or conservator), or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver (or conservator). The FDIC may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institution&#8217;s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of UBOH&#8217;s insured depository institution subsidiary, including any obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Depositor preference 

&#160;

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the FDIC) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including the institution&#8217;s parent bank, holding company and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

&#160;

Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than $10 billion for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. While the Corporation is not subject to examination by the CFPB it is subject to rulemaking promulgated by the CFPB. The CFPB&#8217;s authority includes regulation of financial products and services sold to consumers and it has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to our consumer-facing businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.

&#160;

During 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules related to residential mortgage loan originating and servicing. In particular, in January 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the ability-to-repay rules and qualified mortgage provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under these rules, a lender must make a reasonable, good faith determination that a borrower is able to repay a mortgage before extending the credit, based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower. Loans meeting the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; are granted a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The CFPB has also issued rules affecting other aspects of the residential mortgage loan process, ranging from the customer application to servicing of the loan. These changes and additions to consumer mortgage banking rules have required enhancements to our compliance programs, as well as changes to Union Bank&#8217;s systems and loan processing practices. The ability to repay and qualified mortgage rules became effective on January 10, 2014.

&#160;

Truth in Lending Act 

&#160;

The CFPB, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. To meet the mortgage credit needs of a broader customer base, the Corporation is predominantly an originator of mortgages that are in compliance with the Ability-to-Pay rules.

&#160;

Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on the Corporation&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of UBOH and Union Bank could require them to seek other sources of capital in the future.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Bank Secrecy Act 

&#160;

The BSA requires all financial institutions (including banks and securities broker-dealers) to, among other things, maintain a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence and know-your-customer documentation requirements. Union Bank has established and maintains an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA&#8217;s requirements.

&#160;

Bank transactions with affiliates 

&#160;

Federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank&#8217;s parent bank holding company and certain companies the parent bank holding company may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm&#8217;s-length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank&#8217;s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the bank holding company may be required to provide it.

C. The following tables set forth the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expenses for the periods indicated. For purposes of these tables, changes in interest due to volume and rate were determined as follows: Volume variance - change in volume multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s rate.

Rate variance - change in rate multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s volume.

Rate/volume variance - change in volume multiplied by the change in rate.

&#183; This variance was allocated to volume variances and rate variances in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each.

III. LOAN PORTFOLIO (CONTINUED) &#160;

1. Discussion of the non-accrual policy &#160;

The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Personal loans are typically charged-off no later than when they become 150 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.

&#160;

All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. Interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

&#160;

2. Potential problem loans &#160;

As of December 31, 2015, in addition to the $8.0 million of loans reported under Item III C, there are approximately $15.0 million of other outstanding loans where known information causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans pursuant to Item III C at some future date. Consideration was given to loans classified for regulatory purposes as substandard or special mention that have not been disclosed in Item III C above.

&#160;

3. Foreign outstandings &#160;

None.

&#160;

4. Loan concentrations &#160;

At December 31, 2015, loans outstanding relating to agricultural operations or collateralized by agricultural real estate aggregated $34,997,920. At December 31, 2015, there were four borrowers with loans totaling $71,373 in agricultural loans, which were accounted for on a non-accrual basis; and there was one accruing agricultural loan totaling $259,858 which was contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments.

&#160;

D. Other interest-bearing assets &#160;

As of December 31, 2015, there were no other interest-bearing assets that are required to be disclosed.

(1) Including loans held for sale. &#160;

The amount of loan charge-offs and recoveries fluctuate from year to year due to various factors relating to the condition of the general economy and specific business segments. The 2015 loan charge-offs included twenty-five consumer, mortgage, HELOC, commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $327,000. In 2014, the net recoveries of $255,000 included seven commercial or agricultural borrowers, with the largest charge-off being $181,000. The 2013 loan charge-offs included nine commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $1,269,000. The 2012 loan charge-offs included twenty-three commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $509,000. The 2011 loan charge-offs included twenty-seven commercial or agricultural credits, with the largest individual charge-off being $1,400,000.

&#160;

IV. SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE (CONTINUED) &#160;

The Corporation had a provision for loan losses of $382,000 in 2015 and recognized a negative provision for loan losses of $430,000 in 2014. Problem and potential problem loans aggregated $15.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $18.7 million December 31, 2014. The Corporation will continue to monitor the credit quality of its loan portfolio, and especially the quality of those credits identified as problem or potential problem credits, to ensure the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level.

&#160;

The allowance for loan losses balance and the provision for loan losses are judgmentally determined by management based upon periodic reviews of the loan portfolio. In addition, management considered the level of charge-offs on loans as well as the fluctuations of charge-offs and recoveries on loans including the factors which caused these changes. Estimating the risk of loans and the amount of loss is necessarily subjective. Accordingly, the allowance is maintained by management at a level considered adequate to cover losses that are currently anticipated based on past loss experience, general economic conditions, information about specific borrower situations including their financial position and collateral value and other factors and estimates which are subject to change over time.

&#160;

The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 included specific reserves for impaired loans amounting to $1,371,000 compared to $807,000 at December 31, 2014.

&#160;

While the periodic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses may require management to allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loan situations, the entire allowance is available for any loan charge-offs that occur.

&#160;

V. DEPOSITS &#160;

Deposits have traditionally been the Corporation&#8217;s primary funding source for use in lending and other investment activities. In addition to deposits, the Corporation derives funds from interest and principal repayments on loans and income from other earning assets. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows tend to fluctuate in response to economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attracted principally from within the Corporation's designated market area by offering a variety of deposit instruments, including regular savings accounts, demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, term certificate accounts, and individual retirement accounts (&#34;IRAs&#34;). Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties for the various types of accounts are established periodically by the Corporation&#8217;s management based on the Corporation's liquidity requirements, growth goals, and market trends. From time to time, the Corporation may also acquire brokered deposits. The amount of deposits from outside the Corporation&#8217;s market area is not significant.

&#160;

A.&#38;B. The average amount of deposits and average rates paid are summarized as follows for the years ended December 31: &#160;

VII. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS &#160;

The Corporation has established lines of credit with its major correspondent banks to purchase federal funds to meet liquidity needs. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation did not have any federal funds purchased, out of the $76.5 million available under such lines. The Corporation also uses repurchase agreements as a source of funds. These agreements essentially represent borrowings by the Corporation from customers with maturities of three months or less. Certain securities are pledged as collateral for these agreements. At December 31, 2015, the Corporation had no repurchase agreements.

&#160;

The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance for the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding short-term borrowings (federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements), along with the average aggregate balances and weighted average interest for 2015, 2014, and 2013.
