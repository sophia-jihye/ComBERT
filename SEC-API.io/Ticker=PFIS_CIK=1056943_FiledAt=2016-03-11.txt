 Item 1. Busines s. 

General 

Peoples Financial Services Corp., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, provides a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, including its subsidiary, Peoples Advisors, LLC. On November 30, 2013, Penseco Financial Services Corporation, a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, referred to as &#8220;Penseco,&#8221; merged with and into Peoples Financial Services Corp., with Peoples Financial Services Corp. being the surviving corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 28, 2013. Such transaction is sometimes referred to in this annual report as the &#8220;Penseco merger&#8221; and such agreement as the &#8220;Penseco merger agreement.&#8221; In connection with the Penseco merger, on December 1, 2013, Penseco&#8217;s former banking subsidiary, Penn Security Bank and Trust Company, merged with and into Peoples Neighborhood Bank, and the resulting institution adopted the name, &#8220;Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company.&#8221; 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this annual report to the &#8220;Peoples,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Peoples Financial Services Corp., its direct and indirect subsidiaries and its and their respective predecessors. Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company is sometimes referred to as &#8220;Peoples Bank.&#8221; 

Peoples Bank is a state-chartered bank and trust company under the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or &#8220;FDIC.&#8221; Peoples Bank&#8217;s twenty-four community banking offices, all similar with respect to economic characteristics, share a majority of the following aggregation criteria: products and services; operating processes; customer bases; delivery systems; and regulatory oversight. Accordingly, they are aggregated into a single operating segment. 

Peoples Advisors, LLC, provides investment advisory services through a third party to individuals and small businesses. Peoples Advisors, LLC did not meet the quantitative thresholds for required segment disclosure. 

Market Areas 

Our principal market area consists of Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties in Pennsylvania and Broome County in New York. In addition, parts of Bradford County in Pennsylvania that borders Susquehanna and Wyoming Counties are also considered part of the market area. 

Specifically, our market area is situated between: 

&#183; 

Binghamton, Broome County, New York, located to the north; and 

&#183; 

Bethlehem, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, to the south. 

Susquehanna County could best be described as a bedroom county with a high percentage of its residents commuting to work in Broome County, New York, or Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. The southern part of Susquehanna County tends to gravitate south for both employment and shopping, while the northern part of the county goes north to Broome County, New York. The western part of Susquehanna County gravitates south and west to and through Wyoming County. Approximately half of our offices are located in and around Scranton, the largest city in Lackawanna County with the remaining offices located in counties that would be considered sparsely populated, as they are made up of many small towns and villages. Peoples entered into the Lehigh County market during the fourth quarter of 2014. This market has a greater population than the other counties served with Bethlehem being the second largest city within Lehigh County.

Most recently, the production of natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation located in the heart of our market area has begun to provide economic benefits to the communities served and as a result to us. Natural gas producers have already invested billions of dollars in Pennsylvania in lease and land acquisition, new well drilling, infrastructure development and community partnerships, with an even greater investment expected in the future. The growth of our deposits, and to a lesser extent, loan portfolio, has been influenced by natural gas drilling activities. 

Products and Services 

Our primary products are loans to small- and medium-sized businesses. Other lending products include one-to-four family residential mortgages and consumer loans. We fund our loans, primarily, by offering open time deposits to commercial enterprises and individuals. Other deposit products include certificates of deposits and various demand deposit accounts. 

Lending Activities 

We provide a full range of retail and commercial lending products designed to meet the borrowing needs of consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses in our market areas. A significant amount of our loans are to customers located within our market area. We have no foreign loans or highly leveraged transaction loans, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. Although we participate in loans originated by other banks, we have originated the majority of loans in our portfolio. 

Our retail lending products include the following types of loans, among others: residential real estate; automobiles; manufactured housing; personal; student; home equity, and credit card. Our commercial lending products include the following types of loans, among others: commercial real estate; working capital; equipment and other commercial needs; construction; Small Business Administration, and agricultural and mineral rights. The terms offered on a loan vary depending primarily on the type of loan and credit-worthiness of the borrower. 

Payment risk is a function of the economic climate in which our lending activities are conducted. Economic downturns in the economy generally or in a particular sector could cause cash flow problems for customers and make loan payments more difficult. We attempt to minimize this risk by not being exposed to loan concentrations of a single customer or a group of customers, the loss of any one or more of whom would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition. One element of interest rate risk arises from our fixed rate loans in an environment of changing interest rates. We attempt to mitigate this risk by making adjustable rate commercial loans and by limiting repricing terms to five years or less for customers requiring fixed rate loans. Our lending activity also exposes us to risks that any collateral we take as security is not adequate. We attempt to manage collateral risk by avoiding loan concentrations to particular borrowers, by perfecting liens on collateral and by obtaining appraisals on property prior to extending loans. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these and other types of risks by stratifying authorization requirements by loan size and complexity. 

We generate interest income from our loan and securities portfolios. Other income is generated primarily from merchant transaction fees, trust fees and service charges on deposit accounts. Our primary costs are interest paid on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses. We provide a variety of commercial and retail banking services to business, non-profits, governmental, municipal agencies and professional customers, as well as retail customers, on a personalized basis. Our primary lending products are real estate, commercial and consumer loans. We also offer ATM access, credit cards, active investment accounts, trust department services and other various lending, depository and related financial services. Our primary deposit products are savings and demand deposit accounts and certificates of deposit. 

We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of one or more of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and earnings are not materially affected by seasonal changes or by Federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

We offer a variety of loans including commercial, residential and consumer loans as described above. The consumer portfolio includes automobile loans, educational loans and lines of credit.

We intend to continue to evaluate commercial real estate, commercial business and governmental lending opportunities, including small business lending. We continue to proactively monitor and manage existing credit relationships. 

We have not engaged in sub-prime residential mortgage lending, which is defined as mortgage loans advanced to borrowers who do not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their credit history. We focus our lending efforts within our market area. 

One-to-Four Family Residential Loans . We offer two types of residential mortgage loans: fixed-rate loans, with terms of up to 30 years, and adjustable-rate loans, with interest rates and payments that adjust annually after an initial fixed period of one, three or five years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the appropriate U.S. Treasury Security Index. Our adjustable-rate single-family residential real estate loans generally have caps on increases or decreases in the interest rate at any adjustment date, and a maximum adjustment limit over the life of the loan. Although we offer adjustable-rate loans with initial rates below the fully indexed rate, loans tied to the one-year constant maturity treasury are underwritten using methods approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which require borrowers to be qualified at a rate equal to 200 basis points above the discounted loan rate under certain conditions. 

Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans, among other factors. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 

Most of our residential loans are underwritten to standards established by the secondary market. We also offer VA and FHA loans via a third party lending source. 

While one-to-four family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We do not offer loans with negative amortization or interest only loans. 

We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, typically with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 80%. Home equity loans generally have fixed-rates of interest and are originated with terms of up to 15 years. Home equity lines of credit generally have variable rates and are indexed to the prime rate. Home equity lines of credit generally have draw periods with 20 year repayment periods. 

We generally do not make high loan-to-value loans (defined as loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%) without private mortgage insurance. The maximum loan-to-value ratio we generally permit is 95% with private mortgage insurance. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans . We offer commercial real estate loans secured by real estate primarily with adjustable rates. We originate a variety of commercial real estate loans generally for terms up to 25 years and payments based on an amortization schedule of up to 25 years. These loans are typically based on either the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate or our own pricing criteria and adjust every three to five years. Commercial real estate loans also are originated for the acquisition and development of land, including development for residential use. Conditions of acquisition and development loans originated generally limit the number of model homes and homes built on speculation, and draws are scheduled against executed agreements of sale. Commercial real estate loans for the acquisition and development of land are typically based upon the prime rate. Commercial real estate loans for developed real estate and for real estate acquisition and development are originated generally with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%, while loans for the acquisition of land are originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of 65%.

&#160;

Commercial Loans . We offer commercial business loans to professionals, sole proprietorships and small businesses in our market area. We offer installment loans for capital improvements, equipment acquisition and long-term working capital. These loans are typically priced at short term fixed rates or variable rates based on the prime rate. These loans are secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment and inventory, and, generally, are backed by personal guarantees of the owner or owners of the business. We originate lines of credit to finance the working capital needs of businesses to be repaid by seasonal cash flows or to provide a period of time during which the business can borrow funds for planned equipment purchases. 

When making commercial business loans, we consider the consolidated financial statements of the borrower and any guarantors, the borrower&#8217;s payment history of both corporate and personal debt, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and guarantor, the viability of the industry in which the customer operates and the value of the collateral. 

Consumer Loans . We offer a variety of consumer loans, including lines of credit, automobile loans and loans secured by savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We also offer unsecured loans. 

We offer loans secured by new and used automobiles, primarily indirectly through dealerships. These loans have fixed interest rates and generally have terms up to six years. We offer automobile loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 100% of the purchase price of the vehicle depending upon the credit history of the borrower and other factors. 

We offer consumer loans secured by savings accounts and certificates of deposit held by us based upon the deposit rates plus a margin with terms up to five years. We offer such loans up to 100% of the principal balance of the certificate of deposit or balance in the savings account. We also offer unsecured loans and lines of credit with terms up to five years. Our unsecured loans and lines of credit bear a substantially higher interest rate than our secured loans and lines of credit. 

The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant&#8217;s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 

We have adhered and continue to adhere to credit policies, both prior to and during the recent economic downturn, which management believes are sound. Our loan policies require verification of information provided by loan applicants as well as an assessment of their ability to repay for all loans. At no time have we made loans similar to those commonly referred to as &#8220;no doc&#8221; or &#8220;stated income&#8221; loans. 

While the vast majority of the loans in our loan portfolio are secured by collateral, we have made and will continue to make loans on an unsecured basis. Unsecured commercial loans are only granted to those borrowers exhibiting historically strong cash flow and capacity with seasoned management. Unsecured consumer loans are made for relatively short terms and to borrowers with strong credit histories. 

We consider requests to modify, restructure or otherwise change the terms of loans on an individual basis as circumstances and/or reasons for such changes may vary. All such changes in terms must be authorized by the appropriate approval body. Also, our credit policy prohibits the modification of loans or the extension of additional credit to borrowers who are not current on their payments. Exceptions are approved only where our position in the credit relationship is expected to be enhanced by such action. 

Adjustable-Rate Loans . While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of collateral also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential mortgage loans. We attempt to negotiate floors on most adjustable rate commercial loans. The commercial adjustable rate loans generally provide a fixed rate re-negotiation at the end of the initial fixed rate period. If we and the borrower are unable to agree on a new 

- 4 - 

&#160;

fixed rate then the rate converts to a floating rate obligation. In addition, some commercial loans adjust to a predetermined index plus a spread at the end of the initial fixed rate period, for a like period of time. To a lesser degree, we have entered into transactions with collars generally for periods of five years or less. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans . Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower&#8217;s and any guarantor&#8217;s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the financed project. Additional considerations include: location, market and geographic concentrations, loan to value, strength of guarantors and quality of tenants. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual consolidated financial statements on commercial real estate loans and rent rolls where applicable. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a cash flow analysis of the borrower and guarantor, when applicable, and considers the net operating income of the property, the borrower&#8217;s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.2 times. An environmental report is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. 

Commercial Business Loans . Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower&#8217;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 

Consumer Loans . Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. In the latter case, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 

&#160; 

Loan Originations . Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising and referrals from customers. We also purchase participations in loans from local financial institutions to supplement our lending portfolio. Loan participations are subject to the same credit analysis and loan approvals as the loans we originate. We are permitted to review all of the documentation relating to any loan in which we participate. However, in a purchased participation loan, we do not service the loan and are subject to the policies and practices of the lead lender with regard to monitoring delinquencies, pursuing collections and instituting foreclosure proceedings. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. The board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers or groups of officers up to prescribed limits, based on the officer&#8217;s experience. 

Loans to One Borrower . The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related entities generally is limited, by regulation, to 15% of the capital accounts of Peoples Bank. Capital accounts include the 

- 5 - 

&#160;

aggregate of capital, surplus, undivided profits, capital securities and reserve for loan losses. At December 31, 2015, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $28.9 million. 

Deposit Activities 

Our primary source of funds is the cash flow provided by our financing activities, mainly deposit gathering. Other sources of funds are provided by investing activities, including principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, and operating activities, primarily net income. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms, including, among others: money market accounts; NOW accounts; savings accounts; certificates of deposit; individual retirement accounts, and demand deposit accounts. These deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch offices. We rely primarily on marketing, product innovation, technology, service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits. Other deposit related services include: remote deposit capture; automatic clearing house transactions; cash management services; automated teller machines; point of sale transactions; safe deposit boxes; night depository services; direct deposit, and official check services. 

Trust, Wealth Management and Brokerage and Services 

Through our trust department, we offer a broad range of fiduciary and investment services. Our trust and investment services include: 

&#183; 

investment management 

&#183; 

IRA trustee services 

&#183; 

estate administration 

&#183; 

living trusts 

&#183; 

trustee under will 

&#183; 

guardianships 

&#183; 

life insurance trusts 

&#183; 

custodial services / IRA custodial services 

&#183; 

corporate trusts, and 

&#183; 

pension and profit sharing plans. 

&#160; 

We provide a comprehensive array of wealth management products and services through Peoples Advisors, LLC to individuals, small businesses and nonprofit entities. These products and services include the following, among others: investment portfolio management; estate planning; annuities; business succession planning; insurances; education funding strategies, and tax planning. 

We have a third party marketing agreement with a broker-dealer that allows us to offer a full range of securities, brokerage services and annuity sales to our customers. Our investor services division is located in our headquarters building and the services are offered throughout the entire branch system. Through this relationship, our clients have access to a wide array of financial and wealth management strategies, including services such as professional money management, retirement and education planning, and investment products including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and insurance products.

&#160;

Merchant Services 

We offer credit card processing and a variety of other products and services to our merchant customers, including: 

&#183; 

small business checking accounts 

&#183; 

merchant money market account 

&#183; 

online banking 

&#183; 

telephone banking 

&#183; 

business credit cards 

&#183; 

merchant line of credit 

&#183; 

business profitability and peer analysis, and 

&#183; 

financial checkup. 

Competition 

We compete primarily with commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions, many of which are substantially larger in terms of assets and available resources. Certain of these institutions have significantly higher lending limits than we do, and may provide various services for their customers that we presently do not. In addition, we experience competition for deposits from mutual funds and security brokers, while consumer discount, mortgage and insurance companies compete for various types of loans. Credit unions, finance companies and mortgage companies enjoy certain competitive advantages over us, as they are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and taxations as commercial banks. Principal methods of competing for bank products, permitted nonbanking services and financial activities include price, nature of product, quality of service and convenience of location. 

In our market area, interest rates on deposits, especially time deposits, and interest rates and fees charged to customers on loans are very competitive. In the current economic environment there is increased competition in view of weaker loan demand. 

We believe that our most significant competitive advantage originates from our business philosophy which includes offering direct access to senior management and other officers and providing friendly, informed and courteous service, local and timely decision making, flexible and reasonable operating procedures and consistently applied credit policies. In addition, our success has been, and will continue to be, a result of our emphasis on community involvement and customer relationships. With consolidation continuing in the financial industry, and particularly in our market area, smaller community banks like us are gaining opportunities and market share as larger institutions reduce their emphasis on or exit the markets. 

Seasonality 

Generally, our operations are not seasonal in nature. Our business activities, however, have been somewhat influenced by the recent increase in activities related to natural gas drilling in our market area, which are to some extent seasonal in nature. 

Supervision and Regulation 

We are extensively regulated under federal and state laws. Generally, these laws and regulations are intended to protect consumers, not shareholders. The following is a summary description of certain provisions of law that affect the 

- 7 - 

&#160;

regulation of bank holding companies and banks. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in law and regulation may have a material effect on our business and prospects. 

Peoples is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, referred to as the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221; or the &#8220;FRB.&#8221; We are required to file annual and quarterly reports with the FRB and to provide the FRB with such additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB also conducts examinations of Peoples. 

With certain limited exceptions, we are required to obtain prior approval from the FRB before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any voting securities or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company, or before merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Additionally, with certain exceptions, any person or entity proposing to acquire control through direct or indirect ownership of 25% or more of our voting securities is required to give 60 days&#8217; written notice of the acquisition to the FRB, which may prohibit the transaction, and to publish notice to the public. 

Peoples Bank is regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the &#8220;Department of Banking&#8221;) and the FDIC. The Department of Banking may prohibit an institution over which it has supervisory authority from engaging in activities or investments that the agency believes constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Federal banking regulators have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to constitute unsafe or unsound practices. 

Enforcement actions may include: 

&#183; 

the appointment of a conservator or receiver; 

&#183; 

the issuance of a cease and desist order; 

&#183; 

the termination of deposit insurance, the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties; 

&#183; 

the issuance of directives to increase capital; 

&#183; 

the issuance of formal and informal agreements and orders; 

&#183; 

the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and 

&#183; 

the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or any other court actions. 

We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons which generally require that such credit extensions be made on substantially the same terms as are available to third persons dealing with us, and not involving more than the normal risk of repayment. Other laws tie the maximum amount that may be loaned to any one customer and its related interests to our capital levels. 

&#160; Limitations on Dividends and Other Payments 

Our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from Peoples Bank. Both federal and state laws impose restrictions on our ability and the ability of Peoples Bank to pay dividends. Under such restrictions, Peoples Bank may only declare and pay dividends out of accumulated net earnings, including accumulated net earnings acquired as a result of a merger within seven years. Further, Peoples Bank may not declare or pay any dividends unless Peoples Bank&#8217;s surplus would not be reduced by the payment of the dividend. Pennsylvania law requires that each year Peoples Bank set aside as surplus, a sum equal to not less than 10 percent of its net earnings to maintain the surplus funds equal 

- 8 - 

&#160;

100 percent of our capital stock. In addition to these specific restrictions, bank regulatory agencies, in general, also have the ability to prohibit proposed dividends by a financial institution that would otherwise be permitted under applicable regulations if the regulatory body determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Permitted Non-Banking Activities 

Generally, a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than banking, managing, or controlling its bank and other authorized subsidiaries, and providing service to those subsidiaries. With prior approval of the FRB, we may acquire more than 5% of the assets or outstanding shares of a company engaging in non-bank activities determined by the FRB to be closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks. The FRB provides expedited procedures for expansion into approved categories of non-bank activities. 

Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. These regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from Peoples Bank for our cash needs, including funds for the payment of dividends, interest and operating expenses. Further, subject to certain exceptions, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. 

Under FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and the FRB may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required. A required capital injection may be called for at a time when the holding company does not have the resources to provide it. In addition, depository institutions insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any losses incurred by, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with the default of or assistance provided to, a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution. Accordingly, in the event that any insured subsidiary of a bank holding company causes a loss to the FDIC, other insured subsidiaries of a bank holding company could be required to compensate the FDIC by reimbursing it for the estimated amount of such loss. Such cross guarantee liabilities generally are superior in priority to the obligation of the depository institutions to its shareholders due solely to their status as shareholders and obligations to other affiliates. 

Pennsylvania Law 

As a Pennsylvania incorporated bank holding company, Peoples is subject to various restrictions on its activities as set forth in Pennsylvania law. This is in addition to those restrictions set forth in federal law. Under Pennsylvania law, a bank holding company that desires to acquire a bank or bank holding company that has its principal place of business in Pennsylvania must obtain permission from the Department of Banking. 

Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;) 

FIRREA was enacted into law in order to address the financial condition of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, to restructure the regulation of the thrift industry, and to enhance the supervisory and enforcement powers of the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies. As the primary federal regulator of Peoples Bank, the FDIC, in conjunction with the Department of Banking, is responsible for its supervision. When dealing with capital requirements, those regulatory bodies have the flexibility to impose supervisory agreements on institutions that fail to comply with regulatory requirements. The imposition of a capital plan, termination of deposit insurance, and removal or temporary suspension of an officer, director or other institution-affiliated person may cause enforcement actions. 

There are three levels of civil penalties under FIRREA. 

&#183; 

The first tier provides for civil penalties of up to $5,500 per day for any violation of law or regulation. 

&#183; 

The second tier provides for civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day if more than a minimal loss or a pattern is involved. 

- 9 - 

&#160;

&#183; 

Finally, civil penalties of up to the lesser of $1.1 million or 1% of total assets per day may be assessed for knowingly or recklessly causing a substantial loss to an institution or taking action that results in a substantial pecuniary gain or other benefit. 

Criminal penalties are increased to $1.1 million per violation and may be up to $5.5 million for continuing violations or for the actual amount of gain or loss. These penalties may be combined with prison sentences of up to five years. These penalties are subject to adjustment in accordance with inflation adjustment procedures prescribed under applicable law. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) 

FDICIA provides for, among other things: 

&#183; 

publicly available annual financial condition and management reports for financial institutions, including audits by independent accountants; 

&#183; 

the establishment of uniform accounting standards by federal banking agencies; 

&#183; 

the establishment of a &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; system of regulatory supervision and intervention, based on capitalization levels, with more scrutiny and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital; 

&#183; 

additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver; and 

&#183; 

restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits, except for institutions which significantly exceed minimum capital requirements. 

A central feature of FDICIA is the requirement that the federal banking agencies take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Pursuant to FDICIA, the federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted regulations setting forth a five-tiered system for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions that they supervise. Under these regulations, a depository institution is classified in one of the following capital categories: 

&#183; 

&#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; 

&#183; 

&#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;; 

&#183; 

&#8220;under capitalized&#8221;; 

&#183; 

&#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221;; and 

&#183; 

&#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;. 

Peoples Bank was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action at December 31, 2015, based on the most recent notification from the FDIC. An institution may be deemed by the regulators to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if, among other things, it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity. 

Beginning January 1, 2015, all insured depository institutions must incorporate the revised regulatory capital requirements (see Supervision and Regulatory &#8212; Regulatory Capital Changes) into the prompt corrective action framework, including the new common equity tier 1 capital asset ratio and a higher tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. 

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fees to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be 

- 10 - 

&#160;

undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221;. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of other requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and stop accepting deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator; generally within 90 days of the date such institution is determined to be critically undercapitalized. 

FDICIA provides the federal banking agencies with significantly expanded powers to take enforcement action against institutions that fail to comply with capital or other standards. Such actions may include the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC or the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the institution. FDICIA also limits the circumstances under which the FDIC is permitted to provide financial assistance to an insured institution before appointment of a conservator or receiver. 

Under FDICIA, each federal banking agency is required to prescribe, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted standards covering: 

&#183; 

internal controls; 

&#183; 

information systems and internal audit systems; 

&#183; 

loan documentation; 

&#183; 

credit underwriting; 

&#183; 

interest rate exposure; 

&#183; 

asset growth; and 

&#183; 

compensation fees and benefits. 

Any institution that fails to meet these standards may be required to develop an acceptable plan, specifying the steps that the institutions will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. Peoples believes that it meets substantially all the standards that have been adopted. FDICIA also imposed new capital standards on insured depository institutions. Before establishing new branch offices, Peoples Bank must meet certain minimum capital stock and surplus requirements and must obtain State approval. 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements 

The federal banking regulators have adopted certain risk-based capital guidelines to assist in assessing capital adequacy of a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions, such as letters of credit, and recourse agreements, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit-equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain US Treasury securities, to 100% for assets with relatively high credit risk, such as business loans. 

A banking organization&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets, which include off-balance-sheet items, against both total qualifying capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 capital. 

&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital&#8221; includes common equity and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions, and retained earnings. 

&#8220;Tier 1&#8221;, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangibles, subject to certain exceptions. 

- 11 - 

&#160;

&#8220;Tier 2&#8221;, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, limited life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations and less restricted deductions. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The phase-in period for community banking organizations began January 1, 2015, while larger institutions (generally those with assets of $250 billion or more) began compliance on January 1, 2014. The final rules call for the following capital requirements: 

" 

A minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. 

" 

A minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. 

" 

A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. 

" 

A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. 

In addition, the final rules establish a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016. 

Under the proposed rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) would have been included in a banking organization&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital. The final rules allow community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was required to be made in the first call report or FR Y-9 series report that is filed after the financial institution becomes subject to the final rule. On January 30, 2015, Peoples Board of Directors adopted a resolution to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of the inclusion of the components of AOCI in regulatory capital. 

The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the tier 1 capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 and banking organizations that were mutual holding companies as of May 19, 2010. 

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight. 

Under the new rules, mortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. 

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement actions including: 

" 

limitations on its ability to pay dividends; 

" 

the issuance by the applicable regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and in the case of depository institutions, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as to the measures described under FDICIA as applicable to undercapitalized institutions. 

In addition, future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect the ability of Peoples Bank to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends to Peoples.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, Peoples met its capital requirements with a ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 13.11%; its ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 13.11%; its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 14.05%; and its leverage ratio of 10.48% 

Interest Rate Risk 

Regulatory agencies include, in their evaluations of a bank&#8217;s capital adequacy, an assessment of the bank&#8217;s interest rate risk exposure. The standards for measuring the adequacy and effectiveness of a banking organization&#8217;s interest rate risk management includes a measurement of board of directors and senior management oversight, and a determination of whether a banking organization&#8217;s procedures for comprehensive risk management are appropriate to the circumstances of the specific banking organization. We utilize internal interest rate risk models to measure and monitor interest rate risk. In addition, we employ an independent consultant to provide a quarterly assessment of our interest rate risk. Finally, regulatory agencies, as part of the scope of their periodic examinations, evaluate our interest rate risk. 

Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institution&#8217;s record in meeting the credit needs of its community. The CRA regulations were completely revised as of July 1, 1995, to establish performance-based standards for use in examining for compliance. Peoples Bank had its last CRA compliance examination in 2013 and received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001 

The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) 

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. Dodd-Frank is intended to effect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation. Among other things, Dodd-Frank created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives federal regulators authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms. Dodd-Frank additionally created an independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws. Dodd-Frank has and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business operations as its provisions take effect. It is expected that, as various implementing rules and regulations continue to be released, they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense. Among the provisions that affect us or are likely to affect us are the following: 

Holding Company Capital Requirements 

Dodd-Frank requires the FRB to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. Under these standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank additionally requires that bank regulators issue countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion, consistent with safety and soundness. 

Deposit Insurance 

Dodd-Frank permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. Dodd-Frank also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits 

- 13 - 

&#160;

by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio reaches 1.50% of insured deposits. In lieu of the dividend payments, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that become effective when the reserve ratio exceeds 2.0% and 2.5%. exceeds certain thresholds. Further, Dodd-Frank eliminated the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts. 

Corporate Governance 

Dodd-Frank requires publicly-traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years, a non-binding vote regarding the frequency of the vote on executive compensation at least every six years, and a non-binding vote on &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by stockholders. Additionally, Dodd-Frank directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. Dodd-Frank also gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters. 

&#160; Prohibition Against Charter Conversions of Troubled Institutions 

Dodd-Frank prohibits a depository institution from converting from a state to a federal charter, or vice versa, while it is the subject of a cease and desist order or other formal enforcement action or a memorandum of understanding with respect to a significant supervisory matter unless the appropriate federal banking agency gives notice of the conversion to the federal or state authority that issued the enforcement action and that agency does not object within 30 days. The notice must include a plan to address the significant supervisory matter. The converting institution must also file a copy of the conversion application with its current federal regulator, which must notify the resulting federal regulator of any ongoing supervisory or investigative proceedings that are likely to result in an enforcement action and provide access to all supervisory and investigative information relating thereto. 

Interstate Branching 

Dodd-Frank authorizes national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks are able to enter new markets more freely. 

Limits on Interstate Acquisitions and Mergers 

Dodd-Frank precludes a bank holding company from engaging in an interstate acquisition&#8211;the acquisition of a bank outside its home state&#8211;unless the bank holding company is both well capitalized and well managed. Furthermore, a bank may not engage in an interstate merger with another bank headquartered in another state unless the surviving institution will be well capitalized and well managed. The previous standard in both cases was adequately capitalized and adequately managed. 

Limits on Interchange Fees 

Dodd-Frank amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve issued its final rule, Regulation II, effective October 1, 2011. Consistent with Dodd-Frank, issuers with less than $10 billion in assets, like us, are exempt from debit card interchange fee standards.

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Dodd-Frank authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, Dodd-Frank allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 

Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a final rule on January 10, 2013, which became effective January 10, 2014, amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: 

&#183; 

current or reasonably expected income or assets; 

&#183; 

current employment status; 

&#183; 

the monthly payment on the covered transaction; 

&#183; 

the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; 

&#183; 

the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; 

&#183; 

current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; 

&#183; 

the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and 

&#183; 

credit history. 

Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result generally protect lenders from fines or litigation in the event of foreclosure. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The final rule, as issued, is not expected to have a material impact on our lending activities or our results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160;

TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosures (TRID) 

On October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented a final rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and RESPA. For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The final rule requires lenders to provide applicants with the new Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and generally applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015. 

Future Legislation 

Proposed legislation is introduced in almost every legislative session that would dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted nor if adopted how it would affect our business. Past history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 348 full-time-equivalent employees. We are not parties to any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our employee relations to be good.
