 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Chimerix Overview 

Chimerix, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing novel, oral antivirals in areas of high unmet medical needs. We were founded in 2000 based on the promise of our proprietary lipid conjugate technology to unlock the potential of some of the most broad-spectrum antivirals by enhancing their antiviral activity and safety profiles in convenient, orally administered dosing regimens. Based on our proprietary lipid conjugate technology, our lead compound, brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001), has progressed to Phase 3 clinical development. In addition, we have an active discovery program focusing on viral targets for which limited or no therapies are currently available. 

Brincidofovir 

Brincidofovir is an investigational nucleotide analog that has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro &#32;against all five families of dsDNA (double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) viruses that affect humans. 

I. 

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) Recipients 

Following the successful demonstration of clinical and statistically significant prevention of CMV reactivation in a dose-escalation, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of BCV in allogeneic HCT recipients, BCV 100 mg twice weekly (BIW) was selected for further development. The results of the Phase 2 trial led to the design of the Phase 3 SUPPRESS trial. 

In late December 2015, we reported top line results from our Phase 3 SUPPRESS trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir in the prevention of CMV infection through the first 24 weeks following an allogeneic HCT. In February 2016, we presented an analysis of the SUPPRESS trial results at the BMT Tandem Meetings. 

The SUPPRESS trial enrolled 452 adult allogeneic (non-self) HCT recipients who were at high risk of CMV infection in the post-transplant period based on antibody evidence of a prior infection with CMV, referred to as &#8220;CMV seropositive&#8221; or &#8220;recipient (R+) seropositive&#8221;. Because there is no approved antiviral for the prevention of CMV reactivation in this patient population, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive brincidofovir 100 mg twice weekly (BIW, n=300) or placebo BIW (n=150); all enrolled subjects were monitored weekly during the first 14 weeks and once every three weeks during the post-treatment period from Week 14 to Week 24 for evidence of CMV reactivation in the blood. If CMV was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 1000 c/mL or two consecutive measurements of &#62;150 c/mL and increasing for subjects identified at enrollment as at increased risk of progression to CMV disease, &#8220;preemptive&#8221; antiviral therapy was initiated. Subjects who died or had missing data at Week 24 were also considered failures for the primary endpoint. Dosing of blinded study drug began as soon after the transplant as the patient could swallow a tablet, but mandated within the first four weeks, and continued through Week 14 following the transplant. These first 14 weeks or ~100 days after a transplant is the period of greatest risk for viral infections. Subjects were followed in the trial for an additional 10 weeks after the last dose of study drug, for a total of 24 weeks after transplant. Because allogeneic HCT recipients are at increased risk for other DNA viral infections including HHV-6, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), adenoviruses (AdV) and BK virus (BKV), against which BCV has in vitro &#32;antiviral activity, key secondary endpoints in SUPPRESS included clinical events associated with DNA viruses such as encephalitis, respiratory infections, graft failure and measures of kidney function. 

A. 

Results from Phase 3 SUPPRESS Trial 

i. 

Primary Endpoint 

In the SUPPRESS trial, brincidofovir did not prevent clinically significant CMV infection through Week 24 after transplant to a greater extent than occurred on placebo, the primary endpoint of the trial. During the on-treatment period through Week 14 after HCT, fewer patients in the BCV arm had a CMV infection (p=0.002). However, during the 10 weeks off-treatment from Week 14 to Week 24, there was an increase in subjects in the brincidofovir arm who failed to meet the primary endpoint through CMV infection, death or missing data compared to the control arm, such that at Week 24 there was no benefit demonstrated for BCV treatment. In the SUPPRESS trial, diarrhea in brincidofovir-treated patients was more frequent and often presumed to be gut graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and treated with corticosteroids, rather than temporarily interrupting study drug according to the Safety Monitoring and Management Plan (SMMP). Among patients who were managed according to the SMMP, significantly fewer CMV infections and lower mortality were observed. 

There was an eight-fold increase in the use of corticosteroids through Week 14 in the brincidofovir arm (median cumulative 26 mg/kg prednisone equivalent) compared to the placebo arm (median cumulative 3 mg/kg prednisone equivalent). The use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of GVHD is known to increase the risk of infections, including CMV infections that occur when patients discontinue antiviral therapy. The rate of CMV infections thus was higher in the brincidofovir arm between Weeks 14 and 24 (22 percent versus 11 percent on placebo), when patients were no longer on study drug. 

Of note, among patients who either underwent T-cell depletion or received alemtuzumab/ATG (approaches that decrease the risk of GVHD), those who were randomized to receive brincidofovir showed a lower incidence of CMV when compared to placebo, at a rate consistent with what was observed in the Phase 2 study of brincidofovir in the HCT setting. 

ii. 

Secondary Endpoint(s) 

Among the secondary efficacy endpoints, brincidofovir was not shown to have a positive effect on BKV hemorrhagic cystitis, though preliminary analysis of BK reactivation over the first eight weeks of randomized therapy showed a trend towards lower incidence of BK viremia on the BCV arm when compared to the placebo arm (12% vs. 20%, Fisher&#8217;s exact p=0.08). There were no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality in the trial (15.5 percent in the brincidofovir arm, 10.1 percent in the placebo arm, p=0.12); the numerical differences appear to be driven by higher use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies in the subjects who received brincidofovir. 

From a safety perspective, the most common adverse events reported for subjects randomized to brincidofovir were acute GVHD (presumed on the basis of symptoms or with biopsy), gastrointestinal (GI) events (predominantly diarrhea), and liver enzyme abnormalities. Although the rate of reported gut GVHD in the Phase 2 study of brincidofovir was higher than that in the placebo cohort, the excess was driven by the over diagnosis of GVHD based on diarrhea alone. Incorporation of the SMMP in the final cohort of the Phase 2 study of brincidofovir 100 mg twice-weekly allowed 90 percent of subjects to successfully resume brincidofovir dosing. As seen in Phase 2, there was no evidence of bone marrow toxicity, kidney toxicity, or viral resistance to brincidofovir observed in the SUPPRESS trial. 

B. 

Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study 

As demonstrated in our Phase 2 dose escalation study of CMV prevention in allogeneic HCT recipients, Study 201, brincidofovir administered at 100 mg BIW prevented reactivation of CMV in patients at high risk, e.g., those patients with serologic evidence of prior CMV infection (R+). Cohorts of adult allogeneic HCT recipients received oral brincidofovir doses of 40 mg once weekly (QW), 100 mg QW, 200 mg QW, 200 mg BIW, and 100 mg BIW, with embedded placebo within each cohort. Cohorts of patients who received 200 mg BIW (Cohort 4) or 100 mg BIW (Cohort 4a) demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the rate of CMV reactivation. 

The subjects who received BCV 200 mg BIW, however, experienced a much higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events and diarrhea in particular. An SMMP was implemented to identify potentially drug-related diarrhea and other gastrointestinal events and to allow a temporary dose interruption for suspected drug-related adverse events. Earlier identification of potentially drug-related gastrointestinal symptoms and the use of temporary dose interruptions in subsequent clinical studies has allowed a majority of study subjects to complete the intended course of brincidofovir. The SMMP was included in Study 202, the Phase 2 clinical study of brincidofovir for AdV infection, with one of 30 patients in the brincidofovir cohorts permanently discontinuing brincidofovir due to diarrhea. The SMMP was included in the SUPPRESS trial, and is also included in the AdVise trial (as further discussed below). 

The SMMP also provides guidance for the early identification of potentially drug-related elevations in the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In both preclinical and early clinical studies, low-grade ALT increases were noted. In preclinical studies these ALT elevations were not accompanied by any evidence of histopathology and were thus considered non-adverse. In the clinic, low-grade ALT increases have been observed in a subset of individuals but not accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia and have been reversible upon cessation of treatment. 

The risk-benefit ratio for medications intended for prevention of infection requires a higher standard of safety and tolerability than medications intended for the treatment of established infection, based on the expectation that a larger number of individuals will receive the medication for prevention in order to avoid clinically significant disease. With respect to brincidofovir, we believe the safety and tolerability that has been established to date support its continued development as a potentially effective prevention of CMV and other DNA viruses. With regards to the safety and tolerability concerns specific to the allogeneic HCT population, the lack of observed hematological or bone marrow toxicity is a critical determinant of brincidofovir&#8217;s use in this population. 

Brincidofovir has not demonstrated kidney toxicity similar to that observed with cidofovir (CDV). In Study 201, monitoring for potential renal toxicity included regular serum creatinine levels, calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and monitoring for the presence of blood in the urine. Subjects receiving brincidofovir 100 mg BIW or 200 mg QW for 10 to 12 weeks had a dose-related improvement in kidney function, while patients who received placebo had a decline through the duration of dosing and the first week of follow-up. In preclinical assessments, brincidofovir has been shown to not be a substrate for human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT-1), the transporter associated with renal dysfunction and renal failure following the intravenous administration of CDV. 

The most significant baseline predictor that correlated with improvements in kidney function in patients receiving brincidofovir was evidence of infection with BK virus, a member of the polyomavirus family. This is the first evidence of a potential clinical 

effect of brincidofovir against BKV. We believe that the potential beneficial effect of brincidofovir on BKV has the opportunity for substantial benefit in kidney transplant recipients, in whom BKV has been associated with renal dysfunction and loss of the transplanted kidney. 

II. 

Adenoviruses (AdV) in Allogeneic HCT Patients 

A. 

Phase 3 AdVise Trial 

In August of 2015, we completed enrollment of the Phase 3 AdVise trial, which is evaluating brincidofovir for the treatment of AdV infections in pediatric and adult patients. Patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT are at especially high risk for developing AdV disease due to profound and persistent immunodeficiency. In this susceptible population, the development of AdV infection associated with viremia is much more prevalent, severe, and rapidly fatal without treatment. In the medical literature, mortality rates of up to 50-80 percent are reported for allogeneic HCT recipients with disseminated disease. 

No product has received regulatory approval for the treatment or prevention of AdV infection. Because of the high risk of progression and short-term mortality with disseminated AdV infection, non-approved agents including intravenous cidofovir have been used, even with the well-known significant risk of nephrotoxicity including the potential for renal failure. Thus, there remains a significant unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment for AdV infection. 

AdVise is an open label, non-randomized multicenter study. Subjects are enrolled into cohorts based on transplant type and degree of infection: 

&#8226; 

Cohort A: allogeneic HCT recipients with localized or asymptomatic AdV infection, 

&#8226; 

Cohort B: allogeneic HCT recipients with disseminated AdV disease, and 

&#8226; 

Cohort C: autologous HCT recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and other patients with high-risk of disseminated adenovirus infection. 

All enrolled subjects have received open-label brincidofovir 100 mg BIW or 2 mg/kg BIW for subjects &#60;50 kg, for a minimum of 12 weeks. Subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug with a primary endpoint of overall survival. The AdVise trial enrolled over 200 patients with serious adenovirus infections, including patients in the key population of allogeneic HCT recipients with disseminated AdV disease (Cohort B), a life-threatening infection that has reported mortality of up to 80 percent. Allogeneic HCT recipients with localized or asymptomatic AdV infection were enrolled in AdVise Cohort A; patients with other reasons for immune suppression that had confirmed serious adenovirus infections were enrolled in AdVise Cohort C, a group that included solid organ transplant recipients and patients receiving chemotherapy or other significant immunosuppressants. 

We are also conducting Study 305 to obtain clinical outcomes data in patients considered matched controls from the same medical centers as AdVise subjects. The matching process is pre-specified and independent of outcome. Full demographics, clinical outcomes including all-cause and AdV-attributable mortality, and key covariates including underlying cancer, antivirals and immunosuppressants received will be captured. The primary efficacy endpoint for subjects with disseminated infection is overall survival. Other key data collected includes antiviral response, rate of co-viral infection and healthcare utilization costs. 

B. 

Interim Results from AdVise 

In February 2015, we presented preliminary results from the first 85 subjects enrolled in the AdVise trial at the annual BMT Tandem Meetings. Enrolled subjects with localized or disseminated adenovirus infection receive brincidofovir for 12 weeks and are followed for 24 weeks after they complete treatment. Preliminary results showed a mortality rate of 37 percent (20 of 54 subjects) among allogeneic HCT recipients with disseminated disease; this mortality rate has clinical implications for the potential utility of brincidofovir in this patient population, given published mortality rates of up to 80 percent for allogeneic transplant recipients with disseminated adenovirus disease. Notably, the allogeneic transplant recipients who began brincidofovir with localized or asymptomatic adenovirus infection had an observed mortality rate of 11 percent (2 of 18 subjects). Median observation in this analysis was 10 weeks following the first dose (range: 1 to 34 weeks). In addition to these important clinical outcomes, a median decrease of greater than 99 percent in the amount of AdV in the blood (or a decrease to undetectable levels) was observed in the majority of patients. Over half of the subjects enrolled in AdVise had more than one DNA viral infection at the time of enrollment. These results were consistent with the results observed in the first 45 subjects in the AdVise trial as presented at the October 2014 annual Infectious Disease Society of America meeting (IDWeek&#174;). 

The preliminary safety and tolerability data in this acutely ill patient population showed a low rate of withdrawal due to brincidofovir-associated adverse events (3/85, 4 percent), with three patients withdrawing from therapy due to lower gastrointestinal events. 

In December 2015, we provided an update of the ongoing analysis of data from the AdVise study. At the time of the report, for the full Cohort B population of HCT recipients with disseminated adenovirus infection, all-cause mortality at day 90 remained less than 40 percent. Full analyses including adverse events (AEs) and relapse rates will be reported in 2016. 

Although adenovirus infection has been described predominantly in a pediatric population, approximately one-third of subjects enrolled in AdVise were 18 years of age or older, with the oldest subject being 69 years old. Importantly, over half of the patients who qualified for AdVise had a second significant DNA viral infection in addition to AdV; these infections included BK virus (46 percent), CMV (28 percent) and Epstein Barr virus (6 percent). 

We will continue to prepare data from the AdVise trial and the historical matched controls to review with the FDA and foreign regulators to determine the regulatory pathway for the treatment of adenovirus. We tentatively expect meetings with the FDA and foreign regulators to review data from the AdVise trial in the second half of 2016. Release of final results of the AdVise trial with matching controls is planned for the second half of 2016. Until we have agreement with the FDA and/or foreign regulators for the regulatory pathway for brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infection, we cannot provide details on the timeline for a New Drug Application or foreign equivalent, but anticipate that treatment of AdV infection is likely to be the first potential indication in a brincidofovir submission. 

III. 

CMV in Kidney Transplant Recipients 

In October 2015, we initiated dosing in our Phase 3 SUSTAIN and SURPASS trials of brincidofovir for prevention of CMV disease in kidney transplant recipients. SUSTAIN was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of brincidofovir for the prevention of CMV disease in kidney transplant recipients at high risk of CMV disease. It was a blinded, non-inferiority study of brincidofovir versus valganciclovir in kidney transplant recipients who have not been previously infected with CMV (CMV seronegative recipient, or &#8220;R-&#8220;) and who therefore have no immunity to CMV, but who received a kidney from a CMV seropositive donor (D+). SURPASS was a blinded study of brincidofovir versus valganciclovir in kidney transplant recipients who are CMV seropositive ("R+"). 

Following a review of results from the SUPPRESS trial and discussion with the FDA regarding our clinical development plan for brincidofovir, we have elected to close the Phase 3 SUSTAIN and SURPASS trials. We are currently evaluating opportunities to confirm brincidofovir&#8217;s benefit in solid organ transplant recipients before embarking on a large-scale Phase 3 program. 

IV. 

Smallpox 

We are currently collaborating with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of brincidofovir as a potential medical countermeasure for smallpox. 

In July 2015, we reported positive results from the pivotal smallpox study that was conducted under the FDA&#8217;s Animal Efficacy Rule, which allows for testing of investigational drugs in animal models to support effectiveness in diseases which are not ethical or feasible to study in humans. In this well-characterized model of smallpox, animals were administered a lethal inoculum of rabbitpox virus, and monitored for clinical signs of disease. Following the onset of fever, animals were randomized to receive placebo, immediate brincidofovir, or brincidofovir after a delay of 24, 48, or 72 hours. In this study, brincidofovir administered immediately following the first clinical evidence of infection (fever) demonstrated 100 percent survival. Animals treated with brincidofovir 24 or 48 hours following confirmation of infection demonstrated a 68 percent statistically significant (p&#60;0.05) reduction in mortality compared to animals that received placebo, which had a less than 50 percent survival. The brincidofovir doses used in this animal study were scaled to equivalent doses used in the Phase 3 clinical trials of brincidofovir for CMV and adenovirus in humans, the SUPPRESS and AdVise trials, respectively. 

CMX157 

CMX157, our second clinical stage nucleotide analog, uses the same proprietary lipid technology as brincidofovir to deliver high intracellular concentrations of the potent antiviral drug, tenofovir. Tenofovir, marketed under the brand name Viread&#174; and in multiple fixed-dose combinations, is widely used for the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In December 2014, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with ContraVir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CTRV) for the development and commercialization of CMX157 for certain antiviral indications. Under the terms of the agreement, ContraVir has sole responsibility with respect to the control of the development and commercialization of CMX157. 

Candidate Selection of CMX669 

We have discovered, developed and selected a novel clinical candidate, CMX669, a compound with in vitro &#32;activity against BK virus and CMV. We are currently evaluating CMX669 in preclinical testing, and are in the process of considering future studies involving CMX669 which could initiate in 2016. 

Norovirus 

We have an active discovery program for norovirus, a viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract which may lead to chronic infection in immunocompromised patients. 

Our Chemical Library and Lipid Conjugate Technology 

Lipid Conjugate Technology 

Our proprietary technology, which we refer to as lipid conjugate technology, is used to covalently modify a drug molecule with a lipid side-chain that mimics a naturally occurring phospholipid component of cellular membranes. The lipid mimic can then utilize natural uptake pathways to achieve oral bioavailability, enhance uptake into cells, and potentially avoid many toxicities. 

We believe that our lipid conjugate technology can be used to develop new drugs from parent molecules having a known mechanism of action but potentially with an improved safety, efficacy, and/or ADME (absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion) profile relative to the parent. Preclinical studies and in vitro &#32;assessments of a number of drugs, including some that are approved, have shown specific improvements in biological activity compared with the parent drug. 

The most advanced example of our proprietary lipid conjugate technology is brincidofovir, which was developed to deliver into cells the active antiviral, cidofovir diphosphate, of a potent but relatively toxic drug, intravenous cidofovir. Use of cidofovir has been limited by significant toxicities, particularly kidney toxicity. Unlike cidofovir, the lipid-bearing brincidofovir molecule is not actively concentrated in the kidneys, but does effectively deliver the active antiviral to cells. Thus we believe that brincidofovir may have a higher benefit-risk ratio that allows its use in the setting of prevention of treatment of adenovirus infection, and potentially protection from or treatment of other DNA viruses. 

Chimerix Chemical Library 

The Chimerix Chemical Library contains over 10,000 heterocyclic ring systems and nucleosides, the majority of which were originally synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Leroy Townsend at the University of Michigan. This library includes approximately 3,500 nucleoside analog compounds that are candidates for lipid conjugation. We have an active discovery program focusing on viral diseases in which there is significant unmet medical need. We are currently screening the library for activity against multiple viruses including CMV, influenza, hepatitis B and norovirus, as well as viral etiologies for emerging viral infections. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics in areas of significant unmet medical need. Our primary initial focus is leveraging the broad-spectrum profile of brincidofovir to address the multiple DNA viral infections common in transplant recipients and patients with relative immune compromise. 

The key components of our strategy are: 

&#8226; 

Continue Development and Successfully Commercialize Brincidofovir for the Treatment of Adenovirus Infections. 

&#9702; 

Our AdVise trial is a Phase 3 study of brincidofovir for the treatment of AdV infection in allogeneic HCT recipients and other immunocompromised patients. We are currently also conducting Study 305 to obtain clinical outcomes data in patients considered matched controls from the same medical centers as AdVise participants. Patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT are at especially high risk for developing AdV disease due to profound and persistent immunodeficiency. In this susceptible population, the development of AdV infection associated with viremia is much more prevalent, severe and rapidly fatal without treatment. Mortality rates up to 50-80 percent are reported for HCT recipients with disseminated disease. No product has received regulatory approval for the treatment or prevention of AdV infection. We intend to present data from the AdVise trial and the historical matched controls to the FDA and foreign regulators to determine 

next steps in the regulatory pathway for the treatment of AdV infections, including any potential additional studies that may be required prior to a marketing approval for BCV. 

&#8226; 

Evaluate the Development Plan for Brincidofovir for the Prevention of CMV. 

&#9702; 

We are currently conducting a review of the overall clinical development plan for brincidofovir in light of all available data, including the results from the recently completed SUPPRESS trial. Our revised development plan may include additional studies to evaluate brincidofovir in the prevention or treatment of CMV, AdV, and other viral infections. 

&#9702; 

We are developing an intravenous (IV) formulation of brincidofovir which may be able to mitigate treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events, including diarrhea as was observed in some subjects in the SUPPRESS study, and which may have resulted in the over diagnosis of gut GVHD and high use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies. We anticipate Phase 1 clinical testing of the IV formulation of BCV to start as early as the second half of 2016. 

&#8226; 

Evaluate Additional Patient Populations and Applications for Use of Brincidofovir. &#32;In addition to our initial development programs focusing on prevention of CMV reactivation in HCT recipients, and treatment of AdV infections in HCT recipients and other immunocompromised patients, we are evaluating other patient populations and treatment opportunities with brincidofovir. 

&#9702; 

BK Virus. We are evaluating the possibility of designing and initiating a Phase 2 trial of brincidofovir to identify the potential clinical benefit of brincidofovir for BK virus in kidney transplant recipients. We anticipate that such a trial could start as early as the fourth quarter of 2016 or early 2017. 

&#9702; 

Additional patient populations. &#32;We intend to evaluate brincidofovir in other immunocompromised patient populations. Beyond the transplant population, patients may be susceptible to multiple DNA viral diseases due to congenital or medically-induced immune deficiencies, including those secondary to biologic therapies for autoimmune and other disorders. Through our Expanded Access Program, hundreds of patients have received brincidofovir for the treatment of life-threatening DNA viral diseases. 

&#9702; 

Additional viral indications. &#32;Brincidofovir has shown activity in vitro &#32;against the five families of DNA viruses that cause disease in humans. We intend to evaluate brincidofovir for the treatment of patients with various other DNA virus induced diseases. 

&#8226; 

Work with BARDA to Advance Our Smallpox Development Program. 

&#9702; 

We have conducted efficacy studies under the FDA&#8217;s Animal Rule to demonstrate the impact of immediate or delayed brincidofovir in a validated model of smallpox infection. We expect to initiate a large-scale Phase 2/3 study investigating the effectiveness of brincidofovir in a (mouse) ectromelia virus model system during late 2016. If we obtain positive results in this study, we would expect to engage the FDA in discussions about what additional studies, if any, would be required for marketing authorization of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox. Following positive data from the mouse study, such a meeting could occur as early as the first half of 2017. 

&#8226; 

Discover and Develop Additional Product Candidates to Strengthen our Product Portfolio. We have an active discovery and preclinical development program focused on identifying and developing new compounds that can be used to treat diseases for which no current therapeutic option exists or which otherwise continue to have high unmet medical need. We intend to leverage our knowledge and experience of nucleoside analogs to advance compounds in the Chimerix Chemical Library through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and potential clinical development and/or partnerships. In addition, we are exploring other potential product opportunities based on the ability of our proprietary lipid conjugate technology to significantly improve the drug profile of molecules with limitations in safety or delivery. 

&#8226; 

Evaluate external opportunities to strengthen our pipeline. 

&#9702; 

We are looking at business development as a means to complement our existing pipeline with technologies that will take advantage of our strengths. We are actively seeking opportunities to grow our business through 

the acquisition of or investment in other companies, through strategic relationships, or through in-licensing of complementary compounds and products. 

Significant Agreements 

ContraVir Pharmaceuticals 

In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with ContraVir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: CTRV) for the development and commercialization of CMX157 for certain antiviral indications. Under the terms of the agreement, ContraVir has sole responsibility with respect to the control of the development and commercialization of CMX157. 

In exchange for the license to CMX157 rights, we received an upfront payment consisting of 120,000 shares of ContraVir Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1.2 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to approximately $20 million in clinical, regulatory and initial commercial milestones in the United States and Europe, as well as royalties and additional milestones based on commercial sales in those territories. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party (subject to standard cure periods), or upon certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. ContraVir may also terminate the license agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis upon sixty days&#8217; prior written notice. 

BARDA 

In February 2011, we entered into a contract with BARDA for the advanced development of brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. The scope of work for the contract includes preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development activities that fall into the following areas: non-clinical animal efficacy studies; clinical activities; manufacturing activities; and all associated regulatory, quality assurance, management, and administrative activities. 

Under the contract, BARDA will reimburse our costs, plus pay us a fixed fee, for the research and development of brincidofovir as a treatment of smallpox infections. The contract consists of an initial performance period, referred to as the base performance segment which ended on May 31, 2013, plus up to four extension periods of around one year each, referred to as option segments, each of which may be exercised at BARDA&#8217;s sole discretion. We must complete agreed upon milestones and deliverables in each discrete work segment before the next option segment is eligible to be exercised. Under the contract as currently in effect, if each follow-on option segment is exercised by BARDA, we may receive up to $75.8 million in expense reimbursement and $5.3 million in fees. 

We substantially completed the first option segment of the contract on August 28, 2014. In September 2014 we were awarded a contract extension for a second option segment providing an additional $17.0 million to Chimerix that is scheduled to end June 2016. On September 11, 2015, BARDA exercised option segment three, which provided approximately $13 million in funding for the performance of the segment, increasing the total funding of the contract, including this option segment, from approximately $53 million to approximately $66 million, and provided that the period of performance for option segment three would begin on September 11, 2015 and end on October 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2015 , we had recognized revenue in aggregate of $46.0 million &#32;with respect to the base performance segment and the first three extension periods. 

Pursuant to the contract, Chimerix and the U.S. government share the rights to any inventions made in the performance of our work under the contract. Specifically, the U.S. government retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid up license to any invention made in the performance of our work under the contract, provided, however, that the U.S. government may, under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving public health and safety, license such inventions to third parties without our consent. There have been no inventions made to date under the BARDA contract. 

The contract may be terminated by BARDA ten days after giving us notice of a material default which remains uncured for ten days. In addition, BARDA is also permitted under applicable law to terminate the contract if it is in the U.S. government&#8217;s best interest. 

In April 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, BARDA posted a notice of intent to use other than full and open competition (Notice of Intent) to award a sole source contract to us for the procurement of brincidofovir for the treatment of smallpox. In July 2015, BARDA issued a related request for proposal (RFP) to us entitled &#8220;2015 Procurement of a Second Smallpox Antiviral Drug for the Strategic National Stockpile." 

In August 2015, we submitted a response to the RFP and we subsequently engaged in discussions with BARDA regarding our response. We understand that BARDA had intended to make a contract award on or prior to September 30, 2015, the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year, but the contract award was initially postponed due to a delay in Congressional approval for the necessary appropriations. The recent approval of a federal budget for fiscal year 2016 may allow negotiations to resume with respect to the RFP.

In May 2002, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (UC) under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to UC&#8217;s patent rights in certain inventions (the UC Patent Rights) related to lipid-conjugated antiviral compounds and their use, including certain patents relating to brincidofovir and CMX157. Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the UC Patent Rights for all human and veterinary uses, and to sublicense such rights subject to certain sublicensing fees and royalty payments. 

In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we issued UC an aggregate of 64,788 shares of our common stock. In connection to the development and commercialization of brincidofovir and CMX157, we could be required to pay UC up to an aggregate of $3.4 million in milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all applicable milestone events under the license agreement. In addition, upon commercialization of any product utilizing the UC Patent Rights, which would include brincidofovir or CMX157, we will be required to pay low single digit royalties on net sales of such product. 

The license agreement requires that we diligently develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds that are covered by the UC Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain development and commercialization milestones. UC may, at its option, either terminate the license agreement or change the license granted from an exclusive license to a non-exclusive license if we fail to meet such development and commercialization milestones. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 

Commercial Operations 

We anticipate that our first commercial indication for brincidofovir may be in the treatment of AdV infections in allogeneic HCT patients. In anticipation of potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of brincidofovir, we are building select commercial functions tied to key milestones, such as availability of topline data from the AdVise trial, potential submission of a marketing application for brincidofovir, and anticipated approval (or PD) date. 

Patients who undergo an allogeneic HCT are likely to be treated at a small number of major medical centers by specialized teams of physicians and healthcare providers. There are approximately 200 U.S. transplant centers. The management of therapies for transplant patients is largely the responsibility of transplant physicians, infectious disease specialists, and clinical pharmacists who oversee post-transplant therapies. These clinicians focus on prevention and management of post-transplant infections as one of their key priorities. Practice patterns for the management of transplant patients and post-transplant viral infections vary from institution to institution across the United States and are highly driven by research activities and publications. 

If brincidofovir is approved for the treatment of AdV infection (or CMV infection), we believe it is possible for us to commercialize brincidofovir in the United States and potentially Canada, or in Europe, with a relatively small commercial infrastructure, which may include a contract sales force, partner sales force, or internal team. While our commercialization efforts may initially be focused on physicians who are responsible for treating adenovirus, this commercial infrastructure would serve as the foundation for an expanded commercial presence based on lifecycle indications and other opportunities within the corporate portfolio. 

Outside of the United States, Canada and Europe, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we may seek to commercialize brincidofovir through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. If we elect to develop brincidofovir for other DNA viral indications, we would plan to do so selectively either on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs, reimbursement complexities and our available resources. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our therapeutic experience, scientific and commercial knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we will face competition from large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and other emerging technologies. 

We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of brincidofovir and our other product candidates are the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile and the risk:benefit trade-off compared to alternative therapies or procedures. Securing market access and reimbursement will be an important element of product uptake and market penetration. Our commercial opportunity could be negatively impacted if our competitors develop or market products or other technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or have greater market access than brincidofovir, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by the availability of generic products. 

If approved, brincidofovir would compete with a number of existing products and other product candidates that target serious viral infections, including drugs and vaccines which demonstrate efficacy against viruses that affect our target patient populations. We believe brincidofovir has potential benefits over the competitive products, including the potential to be the first antiviral indicated for treatment of disseminated AdV in allogeneic HCT recipients. Based on market research, competing products that are currently used, or being developed for use, to treat AdV include and are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

Vistide&#174; (cidofovir for injection), marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. and generic manufacturers; 

&#8226; 

oral and intravenous ganciclovir, a drug that is sold by generic manufacturers; 

&#8226; 

Valcyte&#174; (valganciclovir), a prodrug of ganciclovir that is marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and generic manufacturers; 

&#8226; 

Foscavir&#174; (foscarnet sodium for injection), marketed by Clinigen Group plc and generic manufacturers, 

&#8226; 

acyclovir, a drug that is sold by generic manufacturers, and 

&#8226; 

patient-specific T-cell therapies. 

Other product candidates currently in development may compete against brincidofovir for the prevention or mitigation of CMV infection in a variety of settings, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

letermovir, an anti-CMV drug being developed pursuant to an exclusive worldwide license agreement between AiCuris GmbH &#38; Co. KG and Merck; 

&#8226; 

ASP0113 (TransVax), a CMV prevention vaccine, licensed to Astellas Pharma Inc. from Vical Incorporated and in development by Astellas and Vical; and 

&#8226; 

patient-specific T-cell therapies directed at antigens of CMV and other dsDNA viruses. 

Furthermore, we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market, as advanced technologies become available and as increasing numbers of generic formulations of currently branded products become available. 

Changes in the health care system may limit our ability to price brincidofovir or our other product candidates at a level that would allow recovery of our research and development costs and may impede our ability to generate or maintain a profit. 

&#160; 

We believe that brincidofovir has potential benefits over existing and potential competitive products as described in more detail under &#8220;Business &#8212; Brincidofovir.&#8221; As a result, we believe that brincidofovir should be well positioned to gain market share if we obtain the required regulatory approval. However, even with those benefits, we may not be able to make promotional claims that brincidofovir is superior to these competing products without conducting additional studies, and brincidofovir may be unable to compete successfully against these products. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies we believe are important to our business, including by seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

&#160; 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain licenses to our intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 

&#160; 

We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of our lipid conjugate technology platform and the Chimerix Chemical Library. 

At February 22, 2016 , our worldwide patent portfolio included: 

&#8226; 

over 138 patents or patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from academic institutions, related to brincidofovir and CMX157, which represented a slight increase over the number of patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal 2015; 

&#8226; 

21 patents and patent applications related to our agreement with the University of Michigan regarding our proprietary Chemical Library; and 

&#8226; 

53 US and foreign exclusively and jointly owned patents, and 85 U.S., PCT, and foreign applications relating to brincidofovir or CMX157. 

In 2015, U.S. Patent No. 8,962,829 covering a method of synthesis and the commercial morphic form of brincidofovir was issued to Chimerix. With the addition of this patent, composition of matter coverage for brincidofovir in the U.S. is expected to extend to October 2034. 

Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our lipid-antiviral-conjugate technology platform and the Chimerix Chemical Library, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our antivirals, upon appropriate regulatory approvals, in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to the conduct of our business as a whole. 

We are also open to expanding our intellectual property portfolio through licensing intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have granted and will continue to grant to others licenses under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate and we do not expect to own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. In the past, we have relied on third-party manufacturers for supply of our lead product candidate, brincidofovir, as well as our other product candidates. We expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers for supply of drug substance and product that will be used in clinical trials of brincidofovir, as well as for commercial purposes should brincidofovir be approved. When produced on a commercial scale, we expect that cost-of-goods-sold relating to brincidofovir will generally be in-line with that of other small-molecule pharmaceutical compounds. 

&#160; 

The manufacturing process for brincidofovir drug substance is relatively straight-forward and generally in-line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The process is robust and reproducible, does not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment, uses common synthetic chemistry and readily available materials, including off-the-shelf and made-to-order starting materials, and is readily transferable. 

&#160; 

Our current drug substance supply chain for brincidofovir involves various contractors that supply the raw materials for the drug substance process, a contract manufacturer for an intermediate, and a contract manufacturer for the drug substance. We have completed transferring our current commercial drug substance manufacturing process to our selected contractor that will produce the commercial supply of drug substance and began process validation during 2015. Manufacturers of drug components must meet certain FDA qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. At present, we have qualified only one firm as a supplier of drug substance. We continually assess our manufacturing needs and may seek to engage additional qualified vendors as circumstances dictate. Changes in our requirements may require revalidation of the manufacturing process at a different scale and potentially at a different contractor depending on the necessary scale, infrastructure and technical capabilities. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate. 

&#160; 

Our drug products (tablets, oral suspension, intravenous solution) are also manufactured under contract. We have completed development and transfer of our current commercial tablet and suspension manufacturing processes to our selected contractor that will produce commercial supplies and will begin validation of these processes in 2016. The intravenous formulation of brincidofovir is in early-stage development. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality 

experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to our license agreement with ContraVir, the manufacture of CMX157 is under the control and direction of ContraVir. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, FDA approval process or after FDA approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action, whether before or after the FDA approval process, could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (GLP), or other applicable regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) for a new drug; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and FDA review of the NDA. 

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain. 

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or affected patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion 

criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB), at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

&#160; 

Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

&#160; 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

&#160; 

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted (discussed below). 

&#160; 

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing; this initial review period prior to accepting the NDA for filing is 2 months in duration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from the date of accepting the NDA for filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal 

dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission without prior agreement reached at a pre-submission meeting. 

&#160; 

After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 

&#160; 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If major issues with trial conduct are identified at a site, data collected from that site can be determined to be unacceptable for supporting the application. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 

The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

&#160; 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

&#160; 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or 

biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits to those provided in the United States. 

&#160; 

Expedited Development and Review Programs 

&#160; 

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 

&#160; 

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-review of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any drug products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising agreements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 

&#160; 

We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Our strategic alliance partners may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such strategic alliance partner. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. 

&#160; 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 

&#160; 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company&#8217;s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a trial.

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including prescription drugs. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved prescription drugs and other healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved on a competitive and profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities to provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each Part D prescription drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic 

category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all of the drugs within each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. 

&#160; 

It is not clear what long-term effect the MMA will have on the prices paid for currently approved drugs and the pricing options for newly approved drugs. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Accordingly, any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers. 

&#160; 

We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Currently, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, the U.S. Congress may in the future consider legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations. 

&#160; 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research would be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures would be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear whether research would have any effect on the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved, if the product or the condition that it is intended to treat becomes the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies because many of the ACA&#8217;s reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations to implement the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. In addition, although the United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have indicated that they intend not to implement certain sections of the ACA and some members of the U.S. Congress are still working to repeal the ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the effects of the ACA. 

&#160; 

The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), which was enacted as part of ACA, requires covered manufacturers of drugs covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals, during the course of the preceding calendar year. The final rule implementing the Sunshine Act, published on February 8, 2013, requires data collection on payments to begin on August 1, 2013. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $150,000 per year (up to $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. 

&#160; 

If not preempted by the ACA, several states require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, some states, such as California, Nevada and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 

&#160; 

In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their respective national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal 

product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products for which we receive marketing approval. Historically, the price structures for products launched in the European Union do not follow those of the United States and tend to be significantly lower. 

&#160; 

Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

&#160; 

Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA), must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

&#160; 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or a Biologics License Application in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 

&#160; 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations 

&#160; 

We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 131 &#32;full-time employees. Of these employees, 93 &#32;employees are engaged in research and development activities and 38 &#32;employees are engaged in marketing, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
