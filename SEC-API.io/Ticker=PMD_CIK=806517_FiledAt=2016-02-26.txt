General 

&#160;

Psychemedics Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized on September 24, 1986 to provide testing services for the detection of drugs of abuse through the analysis of hair samples. The Company&#8217;s testing methods utilize a patented technology that digests the hair and releases drugs trapped in the hair without destroying the drugs. This is fundamental to the entire process because the patented method gets virtually 100% of the drug out of the hair, and if you cannot get the drug out of the hair, you cannot measure it. The Company then performs a proprietary custom-designed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on the liquid supernatant, with confirmation testing by mass spectrometry.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s primary application of its patented technology is as a testing service that analyzes hair samples for the presence of certain drugs of abuse. The Company&#8217;s customized proprietary EIA procedures to drug test hair samples differ from the more commonly used immunoassay procedures employed to test urine samples. The Company&#8217;s tests provide quantitative information that can indicate the approximate amount of drug ingested as well as historical data, which can show a pattern of individual drug use over a longer period of time, thereby providing superior detection compared to other types of drug testing. This information is useful to employers for both applicant and employee testing, as well as treatment professionals, law enforcement agencies, school administrators, and parents concerned about their children&#8217;s drug use. The Company provides screening and confirmation by mass spectrometry using industry-accepted practices for cocaine, marijuana, PCP, amphetamines (including ecstasy, eve and Adderall) and opiates (including heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and codeine). In addition, in 2013, the Company launched a hair test for alcohol which also looks back on use over a 90 day period, as our hair drug tests do.

&#160;

Testing services are currently performed at the Company&#8217;s Culver City, California campus located at 5832 Uplander Way and 6100 Bristol Parkway.

&#160; 

Background on Drug Testing with Hair 

&#160;

When certain chemical substances enter the bloodstream, the blood carries these substances to the hair where they become &#8220;entrapped&#8221; in the protein matrix in amounts approximately proportional to the amount ingested. The Company utilizes a patented drug extraction method followed by a unique enzyme immunoassay (EIA) procedure to identify drugs in the hair. The patented drug extraction method effectively releases drugs from the hair without destroying the drugs, getting virtually 100% of the drug out of the hair. The patented method can be used with a broad range of immunoassay screen techniques and mass spectrometry methods. &#160; 

&#160;

The immunoassays produced by the Psychemedics R&#38;D team were uniquely designed specifically to meet and even exceed the standards of radioimmunoassay (&#8220;RIAH&#8221;), the original testing method created and utilized by the Company prior to 2013. Because Psychemedics is the only hair testing laboratory that manufactures its own screening assays, it has full control over all aspects of its technology, and that powerful advantage facilitated the Company's creation of its EIA assays with equivalence to its own previously FDA-cleared radioimmunoassays.

&#160;

The EIA screened positive results are then confirmed by mass spectrometry. Depending upon the length of hair, the Company is able to provide historical information on drug use by the person from whom the sample was obtained. Because head hair grows approximately 1.3 centimeters per month, a 3.9 centimeter head hair sample can reflect drug ingestion over the approximate three months prior to the collection of the sample. Another option is sectional analysis of the head hair sample, in which the hair is sectioned lengthwise to approximately correspond to certain time periods, thereby providing information on patterns of drug use.

&#160; 

Validation of the Company&#8217;s Proprietary Testing Methods 

&#160;

The process of analyzing human hair for the presence of drugs has been the subject of numerous peer-reviewed, scientific field studies. Some of these studies were performed with the following organizations: Boston University School of Public Health; Citizens for a Better Community Court, Columbia University; Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addictive Services; Koba Associates-DC Initiative, Harvard Cocaine Recovery Project; Hutzel Hospital, ISA Associates (Interscience America)-NIDA Workplace Study; University of California-Sleep State Organization; Maternal/Child Substance Abuse Project, Matrix Center, National Public Services Research Institute, Narcotic and Drug Research Institute, San Diego State University-Chemical Dependency Center, Spectrum Inc.; Stapleford Centre (London); Task Force on Violent Crime (Cleveland, Ohio); University of Miami-Department of Psychiatry, University of Miami-Division of Neonatology; University of South Florida-Operation Par Inc.; University of Washington, VA Medical Center-Georgia; U.S. Probation Parole-Santa Ana; and Wayne State University. The above studies included research in the following areas: effects of prenatal drug use, treatment evaluation, workplace drug use, the criminal justice system and epidemiology. Many of the studies have been funded by the National Institute of Justice or the National Institute on Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;). Several hundred research articles written by independent researchers have been published supporting the general validity and usefulness of hair analysis.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Some of the Company&#8217;s customers have also completed their own testing to validate the Company&#8217;s hair test results compared to other companies&#8217; urine test results. These studies consistently confirmed the Company&#8217;s superior detection rate compared to urinalysis testing. When results from the Company&#8217;s hair testing methods were compared to urine results in side-by-side evaluations, 5 to 10 times as many drug abusers were accurately identified by the Company&#8217;s proprietary methods.

&#160;

In 1998, the National Institute of Justice, utilizing Psychemedics&#8217; previously utilized RIAH hair testing assay, completed a Pennsylvania Prison study where hair analysis revealed an average prison drug use level of approximately 7.9% in 1996. Comparatively, urinalysis revealed virtually no positives. After measures to curtail drug use were instituted (drug-sniffing dogs, searches and scanners), the use level fell to approximately 2% according to the results of hair analysis in 1998. Again, the urine tests showed virtually no positives. The study illustrates the usefulness of hair analysis to monitor populations and the weakness of urinalysis.

&#160;

The Company has received 510k clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on seven EIA assays used to test head and body hair for drugs of abuse. As of the date of this document, Psychemedics is the only company to receive FDA clearance for testing of drugs of abuse using both head and body hair for seven drugs of abuse.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s decontamination wash protocol and the effects in eliminating surface contamination were analyzed in a study conducted by scientists at the Laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and published in August 2014 in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology. The FBI concluded that the use of an extended wash protocol of the type used by the Company will exclude false positive results from environmental contact with cocaine. In the study, the FBI cited Psychemedics&#8217; studies published in 1993, 2002, 2004, and 2005, and named our lab director Dr. Michael Schaffer and our lab in its acknowledgments. The FBI study also supported the use of metabolites known as hydroxycocaines as evidence of ingestion. These metabolites were first identified in hair by Psychemedics.

&#160; 

Advantages of Using the Company&#8217;s Patented Method 

&#160; 

The Company asserts that hair testing using its patented method confers substantive advantages over detection through urinalysis. Although urinalysis testing can provide accurate drug use information, the scope of the information is short-term and is generally limited to the type of drug ingested within a few days of the test. Studies published in many scientific publications have indicated that most drugs disappear from urine within a few days.

&#160;

In contrast to urinalysis testing, hair testing using the Company&#8217;s patented method can provide long-term historical drug use information resulting in a significantly wider window of detection. This window may be several months or longer depending on the length of the hair sample. The Company&#8217;s standard test offering, however, uses a 3.9 centimeter length head hair sample cut close to the scalp, which measures use for approximately three months prior to collection of the sample. 

&#160;

This wider window enhances the detection efficiency of hair analysis, making it particularly useful in pre-employment and random testing. Hair testing not only identifies more drug users, but it may also uncover patterns and severity of drug use (information most helpful in determining the scope of an individual&#8217;s involvement with drugs), while serving as a deterrent against drug use. Hair testing employing the Company&#8217;s patented method greatly reduces the incidence of &#8220;false negatives&#8221; associated with evasive measures typically encountered with urinalysis testing. For example, urinalysis test results are adversely impacted by excessive fluid intake prior to testing and by adulteration or substitution of the urine sample. Moreover, a drug user who abstains from use for a few days prior to urinalysis testing can usually escape detection. Hair testing is effectively free of these problems, as it cannot be thwarted by evasive measures typically encountered with urinalysis testing. Hair testing is also attractive to customers since sample collection is typically performed under close supervision yet is less intrusive and less embarrassing for test subjects.

&#160;

Hair testing using the Company&#8217;s patented method (with mass spectrometry confirmation) further reduces the prospects of error in conducting drug detection tests. Urinalysis testing is more susceptible to problems such as &#8220;evidentiary false positives&#8221; resulting from passive drug exposure or poppy seeds. To combat this problem, in federally mandated testing, the opiate cutoff levels for urine testing were raised 667% (from 300 to 2,000 ng/ml) on December 1, 1998, and testing for the presence of a heroin metabolite, 6-MAM, was required. These requirements, however, effectively reduced the detection time frame for confirmed heroin use, such that 6-MAM in urine can typically only be detected for several hours post drug use. In contrast, the metabolite 6-MAM is stable in hair and can be detected for months.

&#160;

In the event a positive urinalysis test result is challenged, a test on a newly collected urine sample is not a viable remedy. Unless the forewarned individual continues to use drugs prior to the date of the newly collected sample, a re-test may yield a negative result when using urinalysis testing because of temporary abstinence. In contrast, when the Company&#8217;s hair testing method is offered on a repeat hair sample, the individual suspected of drug use cannot as easily affect the results because historical drug use data remains locked in the hair fiber.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

When compared to other hair testing methods, not only are the Company&#8217;s assays cleared by the FDA for head and body hair, they also employ a unique patented method of digesting hair that the Company believes allows for the most efficient release of drugs from the hair without destroying the drugs. The Company&#8217;s method of releasing drugs from hair is a key advantage and results in superior detection rates.

&#160; 

Disadvantages of Hair Testing 

&#160;

There are some disadvantages of hair testing as compared to drug detection through urinalysis. Because hair starts growing below the skin surface, drug ingestion evidence does not appear in hair above the scalp until approximately five to seven days after use.

&#160;

Thus, hair testing is not suitable for determining drug presence in &#8220;for cause&#8221; testing as is done in connection with an accident investigation. It does, however, provide a drug history which can complement urinalysis information in &#8220;for cause&#8221; testing.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s prices for its tests are generally somewhat higher than prices for tests using urinalysis, but the Company believes that its superior detection rates provide more value to the customer. This pricing policy could, however, adversely impact the growth of the Company&#8217;s sales volume.

&#160; 

Hair Alcohol Testing 

&#160;

In 2013, the Company launched a test for alcohol using hair. This test measures average alcohol consumption over a period of approximately three months, indicates the approximate level of alcohol use during that time period, and can provide a behavioral indication of excessive use. The test measures the amount of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in the hair &#8211; a trace metabolite of ethanol and a direct alcohol biomarker. The test follows the guidelines determined by the World Health Organization in association with the Society of Hair Testing for measuring consumption.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Certain aspects of the hair analysis method currently used by the Company are covered by US and foreign patents owned by the Company. The Company has been granted a total of ten US patents, including a patent issued to the Company in 2011 that focuses on digesting hair and releasing drugs trapped in the hair without destroying the drugs. This patent can be used with a broad range of immunoassay screen techniques, mass spectrometry methods, and chromatographic procedures. In 2012, the Company received an additional patent that extended the range of the patent received in 2011. Additional patent applications are currently pending in the U.S. and internationally.

&#160;

The Company also relies on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of its proprietary technology. The Company&#8217;s ability to protect the confidentiality of its trade secrets is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s internal safeguards and upon the laws protecting trade secrets and unfair competition.

&#160;

In the event that patent protection or protection under the laws of trade secrets is not sufficient and the Company&#8217;s competitors succeed in duplicating the Company&#8217;s products, the Company&#8217;s business could be materially adversely affected.

&#160;

Target Markets 

&#160; 

Workplace 

&#160;

The Company focuses its primary marketing efforts on the private sector, with particular emphasis on job applicant and employee testing.

&#160;

Most businesses use drug testing to screen job applicants and employees. The Hazeldon Foundation survey from 2007 indicated that 85 percent of human resource (&#8220;HR&#8221;) professionals believe that drug testing is an effective way to identify substance abuse. The prevalence of drug screening programs reflects a concern that drug use contributes to employee health problems and costs (as the same study found that 62 percent of HR professionals believe that absenteeism is the most significant problem caused by substance abuse and addiction, followed at 49 percent by reduced productivity, a lack of trustworthiness at 39 percent, a negative impact on the company&#8217;s external image at 32 percent, missed deadlines at 31 percent, and in certain industries, safety hazards.) It has been estimated that the cost to American businesses is more than $100 billion annually.

&#160;

The principal criticism of employee drug testing programs centers on the effectiveness of the testing program. Most private sector testing programs use urinalysis. Such programs are susceptible to evasive maneuvers and the inability to obtain confirmation through repeat samples in the event of a challenged result. An industry has developed over the Internet, and through direct mail, marketing a wide variety of adulterants, dilutants, clean urine and devices to assist drug users in falsifying urine test results.

&#160;

Moreover, scheduled tests such as pre-employment testing and some random testing programs provide an opportunity for many drug users to simply abstain for a few days in order to escape detection by urinalysis.

&#160;

The Company presents its patented hair analysis method to potential clients as a better technology well suited to employer needs. Field studies and actual client results support the accuracy and superior effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s patented technology and its ability to detect varying levels of drug use.

&#160;

The Company performs a confirmation test of all screened positive results through mass spectrometry. The use of mass spectrometry is an industry accepted practice used to confirm a positive test result from the screening process. The Company offers its clients an expanded drug screen with mass spectrometry confirmation of cocaine, PCP, marijuana, amphetamines (including Ecstasy and Eve), and opiates (including heroin, codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxycodone). In addition, the Company offers a hair test for alcohol which also looks back on use over a 90 day period, as our hair drug tests do.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Schools 

&#160; 

The Company currently serves hundreds of schools throughout the United States and in several foreign countries. The Company offers its school clients the same five-drug screen with mass spectrometry confirmation that is used with the Company&#8217;s workplace testing service. In addition, the Company offers a hair test for alcohol which also looks back on use over a 90 day period, as our hair drug tests do.

&#160; 

Parents 

&#160;

The Company also offers a personal drug testing service, known as &#8220;PDT-90&#8221;&#174;, for parents concerned about drug use by their children. It allows parents to collect a small sample of hair from their child in the privacy of the home, send it to the Company&#8217;s laboratory and have it tested for drugs of abuse by the Company. The PDT-90 testing service uses the same patented method that is used with the Company&#8217;s workplace testing service.

&#160;

Research 

&#160;

The Company is involved in the following ongoing studies involving use of drugs of abuse in various populations: Mclean Hospital and Wayne State University.

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

The Company markets its corporate drug testing services primarily through its own sales force and through distributors. Sales offices are located in several major cities in the United States in order to facilitate communications with corporate employers. The Company markets its home drug testing service, PDT-90, through the Internet.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company competes directly with numerous commercial laboratories that test for drugs primarily through urinalysis testing. Most of these laboratories, such as Quest Diagnostics, have substantially greater financial resources, market identity, marketing organizations, facilities, and more personnel than the Company. The Company has been steadily increasing its base of corporate customers and believes that future success with new customers is dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to communicate the advantages of implementing a drug program utilizing the Company&#8217;s patented hair analysis method.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s ability to compete is also a function of pricing. The Company&#8217;s prices for its tests are generally somewhat higher than prices for tests using urinalysis. However, the Company believes that its superior detection rates, coupled with the customer&#8217;s ability to test less frequently due to hair testing&#8217;s wider window of detection (several months versus approximately three days with urinalysis), provide more value to the customer. This pricing policy could, however, lead to slower sales growth for the Company.

&#160;

The Company also competes with other hair testing laboratories. The Company distinguishes itself from hair testing competitors by emphasizing the superior results the Company obtains through use of its unique patented extraction method (getting drug out of the hair), in combination with the Company&#8217;s FDA cleared immunoassay screen.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The Company is licensed as a clinical laboratory by the State of California as well as certain other states. All tests are performed according to the laboratory standards established by the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;), and various state licensing statutes.

&#160;

A substantial number of states regulate drug testing. The scope and nature of such regulations varies greatly from state to state and is subject to change from time to time. The Company addresses state law issues on an ongoing basis.

&#160;

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the &#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) requires companies engaged in the business of testing for drugs of abuse using a test (screening assay) not previously recognized by the FDA to submit their assay to the FDA for recognition prior to marketing. In addition, the laboratory performing the tests is required to be certified by a recognized agency. In 2002, the Company received 510k clearance to market all five of its assays utilizing RIAH technology.

&#160;

In 2008, the Company received the first CAP (College of American Pathologists) certification specifically including hair testing.

&#160;

In 2011, the Company received ISO/IEC 17025 International Accreditation for a broad spectrum of laboratory testing including drugs of abuse and forensics in hair and urine specimens. ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation provides formal recognition to laboratories that demonstrate technical competency, and maintains this recognition through periodic evaluations to ensure continued compliance.

&#160;

In 2012, the Company received 510k clearance from the FDA to market five of its assays utilizing the Company&#8217;s custom developed EIA technology.

&#160;

In 2013, the Company received 510k clearance from the FDA to market two additional assays utilizing the Company&#8217;s custom developed EIA technology.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

The Company is continuously engaged in research and development activities. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, $1.6 million, $1.3 million and $825 thousand, respectively, were expended for research and development. The Company continues to perform research activities to develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services utilizing the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology. The Company also continues to evaluate methodologies to enhance its drug screening capabilities. Additional research using the Company&#8217;s proprietary technology is being conducted by outside research organizations through government-funded studies.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 154 full-time equivalent employees, 7 of whom are in R&#38;D. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
