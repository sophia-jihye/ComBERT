 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Historical Background 

Daybreak Oil and Gas, Inc. (referred to herein as &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;Daybreak&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was originally incorporated in the State of Washington on March 11, 1955 as Daybreak Uranium, Inc. The Company was organized to explore for, acquire and develop mineral properties throughout the Western United States. In August 1955, we acquired the assets of Morning Sun Uranium, Inc. By the late 1950&#146;s, we ceased to be a producing mining company and thereafter engaged in mineral exploration only. In May 1964, to reflect the diversity of our mineral holdings, we changed our name to Daybreak Mines, Inc. By February 1967, we had ceased all exploration operations. After that time, our activities were confined to annual assessment and maintenance work on our Idaho mineral properties and other general and administrative functions. In November 2004, we sold our last remaining mineral rights covering approximately 340 acres in Shoshone County, Idaho.

Effective March 1, 2005, we undertook a new business direction for the Company; that of an exploration, development and production company in the oil and natural gas industry. In October of 2005, to better reflect this new direction of the Company, our shareholders approved changing our name to Daybreak Oil and Gas, Inc. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol DBRM.

Our corporate office is located at 1101 N. Argonne Road, Suite A 211, Spokane Valley, Washington 99212-2699. Our telephone number is (509) 232-7674. Additionally, we have a regional operations office located at 1414 S. Friendswood Dr., Suite 212, Friendswood, Texas 77546. The telephone number of our office in Friendswood is (281) 996-4176.

Oil and Natural Gas Overview 

We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company. Our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves through exploration and development activities and selling the production from those reserves at a profit. To be successful, we must, over time, be able to find oil and natural gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs, operating expenses, administrative costs and interest expense, plus offer us a return on our capital investment. A secondary means of generating returns can include the sale of either producing or non-producing lease properties.

Our long-term success depends on, among many other factors, the acquisition and drilling of commercial grade oil and natural gas properties and on the prevailing sales price for oil and natural gas along with associated operating expenses. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of depressed prices, such as we are now experiencing, does have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

The Company&#146;s focus is to pursue oil and natural gas drilling opportunities through joint ventures with industry partners as a means of limiting our drilling risk. Prospects are generally brought to us by other oil and natural gas companies or individuals. We identify and evaluate prospective oil and natural gas properties to determine both the degree of risk and the commercial potential of the project. We seek projects that offer a mix of low risk with a potential of steady reliable revenue as well as projects with a higher risk, but that may also have a larger return. Modern technology including 3-D seismic helps us identify potential oil and natural gas reservoirs and to mitigate our risk. Currently, our core areas of activity are located in Lawrence County, Kentucky and Kern County, California although new opportunities may ultimately be secured in other areas. We seek to maximize the value of our asset base by exploring and developing properties that have both production and reserve growth potential.

In some instances, such as with our California operations, we strive to be the operator of our oil and gas properties. As the operator, we are more directly in control of the timing; costs of drilling and completion; and production operations on our projects. In other instances, such as with our Kentucky properties, we may not serve as operator where we have concluded that the existing operator has existing operational knowledge, equipment and personnel in place, and operates competently and prudently and with the same operational goals that we would have if we served as operator. However, we have our own personnel onsite during critical operations such as drillings, fracturing and completing operations.

Known Trends and Uncertainties 

As we continue to pursue our exploratory and development drilling programs in our Kentucky and California properties the timing of these activities continues to be determined by current oil and natural gas prices; the availability of funds through our lending facility; and in California, the drilling permit approval process. Additionally, our drilling programs are also very sensitive to drilling costs. We attempt to control these costs through drilling efficiencies by working with service providers to receive acceptable unit costs.

In order to continue our drilling programs in Kentucky and California, we must be able to realize an acceptable margin between our expected cash flows from new production and the cost to drill and complete new wells. If any combination of a decrease in oil and natural gas prices; the availability of drilling funds; and/or, the rising costs of drilling, completion and other field services occurs in future periods, we may be forced to modify or discontinue a planned drilling program.

All of the Company&#146;s oil and natural gas production is sold under contracts which are market-sensitive. Accordingly, the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Company. These factors include the level of global demand for and price of petroleum products, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, and overall economic conditions, both foreign and domestic.

Because of the size of our Company, we are highly susceptible to downward changes in the price we receive for our hydrocarbon sales especially crude oil. There has been a significant amount of volatility and dramatic decline in our realized sale price for both oil and natural gas since June of 2014. The decline in the price of crude oil as shown below has had a substantial negative impact on our cash flow from both our Kentucky and California properties.

For the year ended February 29, 2016 crude oil and natural gas revenues declined $1,830,111 in aggregate to $1,253,686. Of the $1,830,111 decline in revenue approximately 84.0% of the decline can be directly attributed to the sharp decline in hydrocarbon prices. It is beyond our control and ability to accurately predict how long hydrocarbon prices will continue to decline; when or at what level they may begin to stabilize; or when they may start to rebound as there are many factors beyond our control that dictate the price we receive on our hydrocarbon sales.

The decline in hydrocarbon prices that we are currently experiencing has had a material adverse effect on our cash flows, reserves valuation and availability of funds in the financial markets. As a result, we are currently unable to make the interest or principal payments required under the terms of our credit facility with our lender, Maximilian Resources, LLC. A series of waivers have been granted by Maximilian for the principal and interest payments that have not been made. Due to the waivers granted by Maximilian, the Company is currently not considered to be in default under terms of the credit facility. Maximilian is continuing to work with the Company in modifying the credit facility terms during this period of lower hydrocarbon prices, but there can be no assurances that this cooperation will continue. Further, there can be no assurances that Maximilian will not declare the Company to be in default under the credit facility.

Competition 

We compete with other independent oil and natural gas companies for exploration prospects, property acquisitions and for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.

We conduct all of our drilling, exploration and production activities onshore in the United States. All of our oil and natural gas assets are located in the United States and all of our revenues are from sales to customers within the United States.

Significant Customers 

At our Twin Bottoms Field project located in Lawrence County, Kentucky, there is only one buyer available for the purchase of our oil production and only one buyer available for the purchase of our natural gas production. Similarly, at our East Slopes Project, located in Kern County, California, there is only one buyer available for the purchase of our oil production. At February 29, 2016, these three individual customers in aggregate represented 100% of crude oil and natural gas sales receivable. If these local purchasers are unable to resell their products or if they lose a significant sales contract then we may incur difficulties in selling our oil and natural gas production.

The Company&#146;s accounts receivable from Kentucky and California for oil and natural gas sales at February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 are set forth in the table below.

Title to Properties 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we make only a cursory review of title to undeveloped oil and natural gas leases at the time we acquire them. However, before drilling operations commence, we search the title, and remedy material defects, if any, before we actually begin drilling the well. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects, we (rather than the seller or lessor of the undeveloped property) typically are obligated to cure any such title defects at our expense. If we are unable to remedy or cure any title defects, so that it would not be prudent for us to commence drilling operations on the property, we could suffer a loss of our entire investment in the property. Except for encumbrances we have granted as described below under &#147;Encumbrances,&#148; we believe that we have good title to our oil and natural gas properties, some of which are subject to immaterial easements, and restrictions.

Encumbrances 

The Company&#146;s debt obligations, pursuant to a loan agreement with Maximilian Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and successor by assignment to Maximilian Investors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as lender, (either party, as appropriate, is referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K as &#147;Maximilian&#148;), and the Company are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and a mortgage on our leases in Kern County, California encompassing the Sunday, Bear, Black, Ball and Dyer Creek Properties. For further information on the loan agreement refer to the discussion under the caption &#147;Non-current debt (long-term borrowings)&#148; found in the MD&#38;A section of this Form 10-K.

Regulation 

The exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters, including the drilling and spacing of wells, hydraulic fracturing operations, allowable rates of production, restoration of surface areas, plugging and abandonment of wells and specific requirements for the operation of wells. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties.

Laws and regulations relating to our business frequently change so we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Future laws and regulations, including changes to existing laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business. These regulatory burdens generally do not affect us any differently than they affect other companies in our industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

All of the states in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, require drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells, restrictions on venting or flaring of natural gas and requirements regarding the ratability of production.

These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil and natural gas within their jurisdiction. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation of production, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.

In the event we conduct operations on federal, state or American Indian oil and natural gas leases, our operations may be required to comply with additional regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements and on-site security regulations, and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management or other relevant federal or state agencies.

The sales prices of oil and natural gas are not presently regulated but rather are set by the market. We cannot predict, however, whether new legislation to regulate the price of energy commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.

Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations in Kentucky. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel. At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, chemical disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.

Operational Hazards and Insurance 

Our operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and natural gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operation. In addition, the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations, or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment.

We maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry. We believe the coverage and types of insurance we maintain are adequate. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.

Employees and Consultants 

At February 29, 2016, we had six full-time employees. Additionally, we regularly use the services of four consultants on an as-needed basis for accounting, technical, oil field, geological, investor relations and administrative services. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In our opinion, relations with our employees are good. We may hire more employees in the future as needed. All other services are currently contracted for with independent contractors. We have not obtained &#147;key person&#148; life insurance on any of our officers or directors.

Long-Term Success 

Our long-term success depends on the successful acquisition, exploration and development of commercial grade oil and natural gas properties as well as the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas to generate future revenues and operating cash flow. Oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and have decreased significantly since June of 2014 and are affected by many factors outside of our control. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of depressed prices, such as we are now experiencing, has had and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such pricing factors are beyond our control, and have resulted and will result in negative fluctuations of our earnings. We believe; however, that even in this volatile pricing environment there are significant opportunities available to us in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry.
