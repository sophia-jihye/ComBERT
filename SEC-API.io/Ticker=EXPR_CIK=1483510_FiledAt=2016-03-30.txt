We offer our customers an assortment of fashionable apparel and accessories to address fashion needs across multiple aspects of their lifestyles, including work, casual, jeanswear, and going-out occasions. 

As of January 30, 2016 , we operated 653 &#32;stores across the United States, in Canada, and in Puerto Rico, including 81 factory outlet stores. Our stores are located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and street locations, and average approximately 8,650 gross square feet. We also sell our products through our e-commerce website, www.express.com, and our mobile app, and have franchise agreements with franchisees who operate Express locations in Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa. Our 2015 &#32;merchandise sales were comprised of approximately 63% women's merchandise and approximately 37% men's merchandise. 

We report one segment, which includes the operation of our brick-and-mortar retail and outlet stores, e-commerce operations, and franchise operations. Additional information about our reportable segment can be found in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our primary competitive strengths are as follows: 

Established Lifestyle Brand. &#32;With over 35 years of heritage, the Express brand represents a distinctive point of view that is confident, sexy, and vibrant. We believe that our customers view Express as a fashion authority and look to us to provide them with the latest fashions that meet their multifaceted lifestyles and allow them to express their individual styles. The Express brand differentiates itself by offering (1) a balanced assortment of core styles and the latest fashions; (2) products that address fashion needs across multiple wearing occasions, including work, casual, jeanswear, and going-out; and (3) quality products at an attractive value. 

Data Driven Processes. Our data driven processes allow us to test approximately three-quarters of our merchandise in select stores and online before placing orders for our broader store base. In addition, we assess sales data and new product development on a weekly basis in order to make in-season inventory adjustments where possible, which allows us to respond to the latest trends. We believe that we have an efficient, diversified, and flexible supply chain, including a network of buying agents and third-party manufacturers located throughout the world, that allows us to quickly identify and respond to trends and bring a tested assortment of high quality products at competitive prices to our stores. 

Strong and Tenured Team. &#32;Our leadership team has extensive experience in the specialty retail apparel business, including in the areas of fashion design and merchandising, manufacturing, marketing, customer experience, e-commerce, store operations, technology, planning and allocation, and real estate, as well as other diverse business experiences that we believe are valuable to us as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Experience and tenure with Express extends deep into our organization, including district and store managers. 

Our Products 

The majority of our apparel designs are created by our in-house design team, and we believe we have developed a portfolio of apparel products that have significant brand value, including the Portofino shirt, Editor pant, and 1MX shirt. We focus on providing our customers with attractively-priced merchandise that is well-constructed and made from quality materials that are designed to last for several seasons, and believe our customers value our consistent fits and detailing. 

We plan our product assortments and display them in our stores and online in a coordinated manner to encourage our customers to purchase multi-item outfits as opposed to individual items. We believe this allows us to better meet our customers' shopping 

objectives while differentiating our product line from competitors. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction. We monitor cross-selling trends in order to optimize our in-store and online product assortment and collection recommendations. 

Sourcing 

Our Sourcing Methods 

We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire and can supply products to us on a timely basis at competitive prices. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and, as a result, contract with third-party vendors for the production of all of our merchandise. We purchase both apparel and accessories through buying agents and directly from vendors. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, ensuring the timely delivery of goods to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in factories, inspecting finished merchandise, and carrying out vendor compliance monitoring and administrative communications on our behalf. 

We purchase the majority of our merchandise outside of the United States through arrangements with approximately 75 &#32;vendors utilizing approximately 306 &#32;manufacturing facilities located in approximately 19 countries throughout the world, primarily in Asia and South and Central America. The top five countries, based on total cost of merchandise purchased, from which we sourced our merchandise in 2015 &#32;were China, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Our top 10 manufacturing facilities, based on cost, supplied approximately 30% of our merchandise in 2015 . We purchase our merchandise using purchase orders and, therefore, are not subject to long-term production contracts with any of our vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents. 

Quality Assurance and Compliance Monitoring 

Each supplier, factory, and subcontractor that manufactures our merchandise is required to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct and certain other purchasing terms and conditions, including those related to product quality. This is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers' operations are conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Code of Vendor Conduct requires that each of our suppliers provides minimum wages and benefits, limits working hours, complies with all laws, including environmental laws, and provides a safe and healthy work environment. It also forbids the use of child labor or forced labor and prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. We monitor compliance through third parties who conduct regular factory audits on our behalf as well as through our buying agents. 

Distribution 

We centrally distribute most of our products from distribution centers in Columbus and Groveport, Ohio that are owned and operated by third parties. Virtually all of the merchandise sold in our stores or on our website is received, processed, warehoused, and distributed through the Columbus distribution facility. Merchandise is typically shipped to our stores and to the Groveport distribution facility via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, providing them with a steady flow of new inventory. 

The third-party distribution facility in Groveport is used to fulfill all orders placed through our website. Merchandise at this facility is received from our Columbus distribution facility, warehoused, and then sent directly to customers via third-party delivery services upon order. The agreement we have with the third party who operates the e-commerce distribution facility and fulfills our e-commerce orders will terminate on May 31, 2016. We have selected a new service provider to provide e-commerce fulfillment services to us that we believe will be able to meet our increasing volume demands and the advanced capabilities needed to meet our customers' expectations for speed of delivery and other related services. This new third-party distribution facility for e-commerce is located in Richwood, Kentucky. We believe that we will be able to successfully transition e-commerce fulfillment to the new service provider prior to May 31, 2016 without any significant disruption in service.

Omni-Channel Customer Experience 

We are committed to creating an omni-channel customer experience that offers a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping in a store or online through a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. We believe that the lines between our store and e-commerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-store and online and often through their mobile devices while in our stores. As a result, we are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional omni-channel experience. 

We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment and project our image of Express as a fashion authority for our target demographic. Our stores feature a vibrant and youthful look, bright signage, and popular music. Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as seasons dictate. To further enhance our customers' experience, we seek to attract enthusiastic store associates who are committed to offering a high level of customer service. We believe our managers and associates deliver a superior shopping experience as a result of the training we provide, the culture of accountability we foster, the incentives we offer, and the decision-making authority we grant to store managers. On average, our store managers have been with Express for over five years. 

Our e-commerce capabilities focus on creating an engaging and easy shopping experience that supports a vibrant, young fashion consumer, whether on a mobile device, tablet, or at a desktop. We have made significant enhancements to our online customer experience making shopping easier for customers, including features such as in-store product availability and enhancements to the mobile app companion shopping experiences we introduced in 2015. 

We plan to make additional investments in our omni-channel capabilities in 2016, including further enhancements to our mobile app, more personalization of customer offers, and completion of a new order management system which will allow us to utilize our inventory more efficiently. We expect these investments to improve the customer experience, increase conversion rates, and improve overall sales and margin performance. 

Competition 

The apparel retail market is highly competitive. We compete with other brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retailers that engage in the retail sale of women's and men's apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, style, breadth, quality, and price of merchandise offered, in-store and on-line 

experience, level of customer service, and brand image. See "Competitive Strengths" for a description of how we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our future success will depend in substantial part on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to fashion trends, offer our customers the products they want, where and when they want them, maintain the strength of the Express brand in the United States, increase awareness of the Express brand, and acquire new customers. 

Technology 

We use information technology to improve the customer experience, both in-store and on-line, and differentiate ourselves from competitors. Our information technology systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our store, e-commerce, merchandising, financial, and real estate teams. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software systems to provide various functions related to point-of-sale, inventory management, design, planning and allocation, and financial reporting. During 2015, we continued to invest in new systems to provide additional capabilities to support our growth initiatives. In 2016, we anticipate continued capital expenditures for systems upgrades related to a new order management system, a new retail management system, and a new enterprise planning system, all of which are expected to launch in 2016. There are risks associated with the implementation of new systems. Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information. 

Intellectual Property 

The Express trademark and certain variations thereon, such as Express World Brand, are registered or are subject to pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and/or with the registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own domain names for many of our trademarks, including express.com. We believe our material trademarks have significant value, and we vigorously protect them against infringement. 

Regulation and Legislation 

We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, including minimum wage requirements, intellectual property laws, consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing advertising and promotions, privacy, and product safety, and laws and regulations with respect to the operation of our stores and business generally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and as a result of being a public company. In addition, we are subject to United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import and export of merchandise. 

Employees 

We currently employ approximately 18,000 employees. Approximately 900 employees are based at our home office locations in either Columbus or New York City, approximately 70 are field-based regional managers, approximately 1,700 are in-store managers or co-managers, and approximately 15,400 are in-store sales associates. Approximately 19% and 81% of our Associates are full-time and part-time, respectively. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

Seasonality 

Our business is seasonal. We define our seasons as Spring (first and second quarters) and Fall (third and fourth quarters). Historically, we have realized a higher portion of our net sales and net income in the Fall season due primarily to the impact of the holiday season. In 2015 , approximately 56% &#32;of our net sales were generated in the Fall season, while approximately 44% &#32;were generated in the Spring season. Cash needs are typically higher in the third quarter due to inventory-related working capital requirements for early Fall and holiday selling periods. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, and regional fluctuations for events such as sales tax holidays. 

Corporate History 

We opened our first store in 1980, in Chicago, Illinois as a division of Limited Brands, Inc. (now known as L Brands, Inc.), and launched our men&#8217;s apparel line in 1987, which was rebranded under the name Structure in 1989. In 2001, we began to consolidate our separate women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s stores into combined dual-gender stores under the Express brand. In 2007, Golden Gate Capital acquired 75% of the equity interests in our business from an affiliate of Limited Brands, Inc. and we began to operate as a standalone company. In May 2010, the Company converted to a Delaware corporation, held an initial public offering, and listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequent to our initial public offering, Golden Gate Capital and Limited Brands, Inc. sold their remaining interests in the Company and are no longer affiliated with Express.
