BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel immunotherapeutic products to improve treatment options for patients with cancer. Our portfolio includes biologic and small-molecule immuno-oncology product candidates intended to treat a wide range of oncology indications. Our biologic product candidates are based on our proprietary HyperAcute &#174; &#32;Cellular Immunotherapy technology, which is designed to stimulate the human immune system. Algenpantucel-L is our most clinically advanced product candidate from this platform with two Phase 3 clinical trials ongoing for patients with pancreatic cancer, one of which is expected to read out data during 2016. Our additional HyperAcute cellular HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates in clinical development include tergenpumatucel-L and dorgenmeltucel-L for patients with advanced lung cancer and melanoma, respectively. Additional product candidates are also under development for patients with other types of cancer. Additionally, we have two small-molecule product candidates currently in clinical development, GDC-0919 and indoximod, which target key immune checkpoints. These product candidates are IDO pathway inhibitors and focus on breaking the immune system&#8217;s tolerance to cancer. We believe that our immuno-oncology technologies have the potential to lead to multiple product candidates, targeting a wide range of oncology indications that could be used either alone or in combination with other therapies. 

Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform consists of novel biologic product candidates designed to stimulate the patient&#8217;s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. To date, our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform product candidates have been administered to more than 700 patients with cancer, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments and have been generally well tolerated with limited grade 3/4 adverse events. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates are composed of human cancer cell lines that are tumor specific, but not patient specific. These cells have been modified to express alpha-Gal, a carbohydrate for which humans have preexisting immunity. These alpha-Gal-modified cancer cells are designed to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells. The objective of HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy is to elicit an antitumor response by &#8220;educating&#8221; the immune system to attack a patient&#8217;s own cancer cells. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies do not require any tissue from individual patients and use intact whole cells rather than cell fragments or purified proteins. We believe these unique properties of our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates have the potential to result in the stimulation of a robust immune response in patients with cancer. 

Our most advanced program, algenpantucel-L, which utilizes our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology, is being studied in two randomized Phase 3 clinical trials. Our first Phase 3 clinical trial, IMPRESS (IMmunotherapy for Pancreatic REsectable cancer Survival Study) completed enrollment of 722 patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint for our IMPRESS trial is overall survival. We expect to report primary IMPRESS results during 2016. Our second Phase 3 clinical trial, PILLAR (Pancreatic Immunotherapy with algenpantucel-L for Locally Advanced non-Resectable disease), has completed enrollment with over 300 patients. The primary endpoint for our PILLAR trial is overall survival. We initiated these trials based on encouraging Phase 2 data that suggest potential to improve both disease-free and overall survival. Algenpantucel-L has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage I/II resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma in combination with adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy with or without adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Commission for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. 

In addition to our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform, we have an active drug discovery and clinical development program focused on the IDO (indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase) and TDO (tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase) pathway. Our small-molecule IDO pathway inhibitor drug candidates currently in clinical development include GDC-0919 (in partnership with Genentech, Inc. a member of the Roche Group or Genentech) and indoximod and are designed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of the IDO pathway, a fundamental mechanism regulating immune response. IDO pathway inhibitors are another class of immune checkpoint inhibitors akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 that represent potential breakthrough approaches to cancer therapy. The IDO pathway regulates immune response by suppressing T-cell activation, which enables local tumor immune escape. Recent clinical trials conducted by third parties have demonstrated that the IDO pathway is active in many cancers, both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T-cell attack, and also within antigen presenting cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, whereby this pathway promotes peripheral tolerance to tumor associated antigens, or TAAs. When hijacked by developing cancers in this manner, the IDO pathway may facilitate the survival, growth, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells whose expression of TAAs might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system. We have a number of active programs directed at synthesizing inhibitors that are potential anti-cancer compounds and that could function individually or in combination with IDO inhibition. 

Our IDO/TDO pathway inhibitors represent a key class of immune checkpoint inhibitors that we believe have the potential to be breakthrough approaches for patients with a variety of different cancer types. This type of molecule has the potential to be combined with different standard of care therapeutic approaches such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy or with novel cancer therapeutic approaches such as other immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells or anti-tumor vaccination. In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, for the development and commercialization of GDC-0919, one of our IDO pathway inhibitors, and a research collaboration for the discovery of next-generation IDO and TDO pathway inhibitors, or the Genentech Agreement. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $150.0 million in November 2014. We may be eligible to receive in excess of $1.0 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones as well as escalating double-digit royalties on potential commercial sales of multiple products by Genentech. Genentech will fund future research, development, manufacturing and commercialization costs. Genentech also provides us with funding for support of the research collaboration. We will continue to pursue development activities associated with GDC-0919 in combination with our novel HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform. We retain the option for co-promotion rights for GDC-0919 and potential next-generation IDO/TDO compounds in the United States. 

&#160; 

GDC-0919 is currently in Phase 1 development led by our collaborators at Genentech. Two Phase 1 clinical trials are currently underway with GDC-0919. GDC-0919 is being evaluated in a Phase 1b combination clinical trial of GDC-0919 and atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Enrollment began in July 2015 and a total enrollment of up to 224 patients is planned. A second Phase 1 clinical trial of GDC-0919 is ongoing evaluating dosing of GDC-0919 in patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors. 

Indoximod, our proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor, is in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating potential clinical activity in multiple solid tumor indications. These trials feature indoximod in combination with both standard of care immunotherapy treatments for cancer as well as standard of care chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Indications being evaluated in indoximod clinical trials include metastatic breast cancer, refractory malignant brain tumors, advanced melanoma, metastatic pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. 

In addition to our immuno-oncology programs, we have a team focused on developing vaccines against infectious diseases. Our infectious disease program researches and develops vaccines to control the spread of emerging lethal viruses and infectious diseases, improve the efficacy of existing vaccines and provide rapid-response prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for pathogens most likely to enter the human population through pandemics or acts of bioterrorism. 

Our primary program is a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, or rVSV, an advanced vaccine technology developed for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola) vaccine product candidate was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and is designed to utilize the rVSV vector to induce immunity against Ebola and Marburg viruses when replacing the VSV glycoprotein with corresponding glycoproteins from filoviruses. In November 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement, or the Merck Agreement, with Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp., or Merck, to develop and potentially commercialize our rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in October 2014, and in February 2015 we received a milestone payment of $20.0 million. We have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and if Merck successfully commercializes it. In addition to milestone payments from Merck, the Company was awarded contracts for development of the rVSV-ZEBOV from the BioMedical Research &#38; Development Agency, or BARDA, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, totaling $67.0 million during 2014 and 2015. In July 2015, we announced that the international partnership studying the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola disease in a large Phase 3 clinical trial. According to the announcement, the interim results suggest that the vaccine candidate demonstrates efficacy within about 10 days of administration to a person without the infection. The rVSV-ZEBOV product candidate will continue to be studied in clinical trials. 

In February 2016, we announced our initiative to develop a vaccine against the Zika virus. We believe that the experience gained in the development of our Ebola vaccine candidate will give us an advantage in this program. 

We had a net loss of $40.4 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We expect our losses to increase over the next several years as we advance our product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, and expand our commercialization activities in anticipation of one or more of our product candidates receiving marketing approval. 

Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Ames, Iowa and Austin, Texas, we have a clinical, research and development staff dedicated to our pipeline of product candidates for potential commercialization. We currently have a manufacturing facility in Ames, Iowa and have plans to expand our facilities to include a commercial manufacturing facility. Additionally, we have established offices in Austin, Texas, where we are currently building our commercial organization through which we intend to market our oncology products in the United States, and in Devens, Massachusetts, where we manage the development of and strategic relationships relating to our infectious disease program. Finally, we have built a manufacturing and packaging facility in Ankeny, Iowa for the final manufacturing stage of algenpantucel-L, if it is approved, and other potential products we may commercialize. Outside the United States we will either commercialize and distribute approved products independently or establish partnerships to address specific needs as we have with Genentech and Merck for some of our product candidates. 

Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Platform 

Our Technology 

Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform consists of novel biologic products designed to stimulate the patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. HyperAcute product candidates are composed of human, tumor-specific cancer cell lines. These cells have been modified to express alpha-Gal, a carbohydrate to which humans have preexisting immunity. These alpha-Gal-modified cancer cells stimulate an immune response that &#8220;educates&#8221; the immune system to attack a patient's own cancer cells. 

We believe our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies operate by exploiting a natural barrier present in humans that protects against infections. This barrier is related to the enzyme alpha (1,3) galactosyltransferase (alpha-GT). The presence of this enzyme results in the expression of a carbohydrate called alpha-Gal on the surface of affected cells. Introducing alpha-Gal expressing cells to the immune system activates an immune response from preexisting antibodies against alpha-Gal. 

We believe that, compared to some prior immunotherapy approaches, our proprietary HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology offers several advantages including: 

&#8226; 

a robust inherent immune response that harnesses the human body's naturally protective and rapid immune reaction to the alpha-Gal carbohydrate as a mechanism to fight cancer; 

&#8226; 

a complex targeted approach that is multi-faceted and involves combined antibody-mediated and multi-cellular responses; and 

&#8226; 

an allogeneic, tumor-specific, but not patient specific, approach, in which we manufacture products from genetically modified, allogeneic cells from previously established cell lines, which permits an easier scale-up of the manufacturing process compared to an autologous, or patient specific, approach involving a patient's own cells. 

HyperAcute &#174; &#32;Cellular Immunotherapy Proposed Mechanism 

Unlike some immunotherapies, HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies do not require the harvesting of an individual's tissue or cancer cells in order to produce the vaccine. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies are manufactured using established tumor-specific human cell lines. In addition, HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies use intact whole cells rather than cell fragments or purified proteins, which we believe results in the stimulation of an enhanced multi-faceted immune response against the patient's cancer. 

HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates are composed of irradiated, live, allogeneic human cancer cells modified to express the gene that makes alpha-Gal. Exposure to alpha-Gal stimulates the human immune system to attack and destroy the immunotherapy cells on which alpha-Gal is present by activating complement, an important component of the immune system that is capable of cell destruction. After destruction, we believe the resulting cellular fragments bound by anti-alpha-Gal antibodies are processed by the immune system to elicit an enhanced multi-faceted immune response to TAAs common to both the immunotherapy and the patient's tumor cells. 

In the case of a HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy, this process results in immune cells that are educated to attack a patient's own cancer cells by virtue of the antigens that the immunotherapy and these tumor cells share and by a more generalized activation of the immune system. Our scientists have shown in mouse models of cancer that the immune system responds after a HyperAcute injection by attacking all similar cancer cells, including those that have no alpha-Gal carbohydrate. 

HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies are designed to break tolerance and enable longer duration of anti-tumor effect. We believe that our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology induces a combination of unique immune responses. 

HyperAcute Pipeline 

We have multiple HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates currently under clinical development specific to multiple types of cancer. 

&#8226; 

Algenpantucel-L &#32;is currently being studied in two Phase 3 clinical trials for patients with pancreatic cancer: 

&#9642; 

IMPRESS &#32;(IMmunotherapy for Pancreatic REsectable cancer Survival Study) 

&#9642; 

PILLAR &#32;(Pancreatic Immunotherapy with algenpantucel-L for Locally Advanced non-Resectable disease) 

&#8226; 

Tergenpumatucel-L &#32;is being investigated in a Phase 2b clinical trial for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is also under investigation in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of tergenpumantucel-L with indoximod and docetaxel for patients with advanced NSCLC 

&#8226; 

Dorgenmeltucel-L &#32;is being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma 

We have also created HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies for patients with other cancer indications such as renal and prostate. 

IDO Pathway Inhibitor Platform 

Our Technology 

The IDO pathway inhibitor platform is focused on developing small molecule drugs that disrupt mechanisms by which tumors evade the patient&#8217;s immune system. IDO pathway inhibitors are another class of immune checkpoint inhibitors akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 that represent potential breakthrough approaches to cancer therapy. Inhibition of the IDO pathway has been shown to reduce immunosuppression and enhance immune response offering the potential for enhanced anti-tumor response in preclinical models. IDO pathway inhibition has demonstrated preclinical synergy in combination with other immunotherapies including other checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines as well as chemotherapy or radiation. 

The IDO pathway regulates immune response by suppressing T cell function and enabling local tumor immune escape. Recent studies indicate that the IDO pathway is active in many cancers, both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T cell attack, and also within antigen-presenting cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes resulting in peripheral tolerance to TAAs. Certain cancers may use the IDO pathway to facilitate survival, growth, invasion, and metastasis of malignant cells expressing TAAs that might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system. 

We believe that immune system failure is a fundamental reason for the inability of the human body to successfully fight cancer cells. Research into the inability of the immune system to respond to cancerous tumors indicates that tumors can induce the human immune system to tolerate the existence of the tumor. This immune tolerance and suppression represents a major barrier to successful treatment of cancer and is a significant target for new therapeutics. 

Scientific understanding of the process leading to immune tolerance is in its early stages. We believe IDO is part of a system that may be used by some tumors as a mechanism to evade the immune system. IDO is an enzyme that regulates immune response by suppressing effector T cell function by breaking down the essential amino acid tryptophan. Expression of IDO, either directly by tumors or by dendritic cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, has been shown in animal studies to induce immune tolerance to tumors, and inhibition of IDO has been shown in these studies to prevent this induction of tolerance. IDO is rarely expressed by the majority of normal tissues, but it is overexpressed in many types of human tumors. 

Cytotoxic chemotherapy places substantial stress on established, tumor-induced tolerance. Several factors can potentially contribute to this result: (1) dying tumor cells release waves of TAAs for processing and presentation, (2) many chemotherapeutic regimens induce a period of transient lymphopenia and homeostatic recovery during which T cells may become more susceptible to breaking tolerance, and (3) certain regimens can transiently deplete or inactivate tumor-protective T-regulatory cells. Despite producing these challenges to tolerance, most chemotherapeutic agents do not appear to trigger a protective immune response against established tumors. This shortcoming of traditional chemotherapy has been attributed, in part, to the ability of tumors to 

rapidly reestablish tolerance following each cycle of chemotherapy. We believe a potential mechanism underlying the failed opportunity is IDO expression by APCs in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which are thereby converted to an immunosuppressive and tolerance-inducing milieu. Preclinical data have demonstrated that IDO pathway inhibitors have anti-tumor effects in combination with a number of radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic drugs or other immunotherapy drug candidates and may work better together than either type of treatment alone. 

The ability to acutely eliminate the protective IDO mechanism by administering IDO pathway inhibitor drugs, such as GDC-0919 or indoximod, may provide a therapeutic window in which to break tolerance in tumors and reverse the inhibition of immune cells. Additionally, we believe that once immune cells are restored to normal function, they can assist in the rejection of tumors. 

We believe our IDO pathway inhibitor technology has the following potential advantages in combating cancers: 

&#8226; 

Potential to break immune tolerance. The immune tolerance to cancerous cells represents a key barrier to the treatment of cancer. To date, there are several available therapies that have addressed the immune escape mechanisms of cancer. We believe inhibition of the IDO pathway has the potential to break a key immune escape mechanism of cancer cells and significantly enhance patient outcomes. 

&#8226; 

Tolerability. In early-stage clinical development, we have observed an encouraging safety profile. We believe inhibition of the IDO pathway will selectively enhance the immune response against cancer cells given the limited expression of IDO in normal cells. 

&#8226; 

Oral bioavailability. Unlike many cancer therapies which require intravenous administration, our IDO pathway inhibitors are orally bioavailable, a significant advantage in ease of administration for patients and physicians. 

&#8226; 

Synergy with existing cancer therapies. Inhibiting the IDO pathway in conjunction with immunotherapy or chemotherapy has the potential to enhance the therapeutic effect of these agents. Used in combination with chemotherapy IDO inhibitors have the potential to delay or disrupt the reacquisition of immune tolerance to tumor antigens during the period following chemotherapy. In addition, preclinical studies have demonstrated the synergistic potential of IDO pathway inhibitors in combination with other cancer immunotherapies, including other checkpoint pathway inhibitors as well as cancer vaccines. The safety profile in humans is conducive to exploring combination therapy and the available animal data does not indicate significant additive or synergistic toxicities with many common oncology therapies. 

IDO Pathway Pipeline 

We are actively developing two IDO pathway inhibitors with broad potential across multiple tumor types. Our IDO pathway inhibitors, GDC-0919 and indoximod, are orally administered small molecules primarily designed to be used in combination with other cancer therapies including other checkpoint inhibitors such as those directed against CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1, cancer vaccines such as our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies and chemotherapy regimens &#32; for potential increased activity. 

In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Genentech for the development and commercialization of GDC-0919 and a research collaboration for the discovery of next generation IDO and TDO pathway inhibitors. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $150 million. We may be eligible to receive in excess of $1 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones as well as escalating royalties on potential commercial sales of multiple products by Genentech. We did not license indoximod under the Genentech Agreement, and we are continuing its clinical development. Indoximod is in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients with breast, prostate, pancreatic and brain cancers, as well as melanoma. 

GDC-0919 and indoximod are being investigated as part of combination regimens including with other checkpoint inhibitors, and chemotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC, advanced melanoma, metastatic prostate cancer, and other cancers. 

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of cancer where the needs of patients are unmet by current therapies. The critical components of our business strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Complete the Phase 3 clinical trials of algenpantucel-L, our lead HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidate, and gain regulatory approval. 

&#8226; 

Build commercial infrastructure to support a successful product launch of algenpantucel-L in the United States and establish commercial collaborations in other regions. 

&#8226; 

Expand current manufacturing capabilities to establish adequate supply for anticipated commercial demand and future clinical development for algenpantucel-L. 

&#8226; 

Establish validated external manufacturing capacity for algenpantucel-L and potential subsequent HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy products. 

&#8226; 

Seek an expanded indication for algenpantucel-L to include the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. 

&#8226; 

Advance our tergenpumatucel-L and dorgenmeltucel-L product candidates through additional clinical trials. 

&#8226; 

Further develop our proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod. 

&#8226; 

Support the strategic alliances with Genentech and Merck. 

&#8226; 

Strengthen our pipeline of immune stimulatory drug candidates, including both our oncology and our infectious disease targets . 

Cancer Market Overview 

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States; the American Cancer Society estimated that more than 550,000 deaths will occur in 2016. Despite a number of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer over the past decade, overall five-year survival rates from all cancer types is 69% for the period spanning 2005-2011 according to the American Cancer Society. 

Cancer is characterized by abnormal cells that grow and proliferate, forming masses called tumors. Under certain circumstances, these proliferating cells can metastasize, or spread, throughout the body and produce deposits of tumor cells called metastases. As the tumors grow, they may cause tissue and organ failure and, ultimately, death. To be effective, cancer therapies must eliminate or control the growth of the cancer. 

The specialized cells of the immune system recognize specific chemical structures called antigens. Generally, foreign antigens trigger an immune response that results in the removal of disease-causing agents from the body. Cancer cells, however, frequently display antigens that are also found on normal cells. The immune system may not be able to distinguish between tumors and normal cells and therefore may be unable to mount a strong anti-cancer response. Tumors also have various defense mechanisms that may prevent the immune system from fully activating. 

Current therapies, such as surgery, radiation, hormone treatments and chemotherapy, do not address this evasive characteristic of cancer and may not have the desired therapeutic effect. Active immunotherapies stimulate the immune system, the body's natural mechanism for fighting disease, and may overcome some of the limitations of current standard-of-care cancer therapies. 

Limitations of Current Cancer Therapies 

We believe current cancer treatment alternatives suffer from a number of limitations that impair their effectiveness including: 

&#8226; 

Toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic to the human body and often cause a variety of side effects, which may include nausea and vomiting, bleeding, anemia and mucositis. Targeted therapeutics may have fewer systemic toxicities, but still tend to have off-target effects such as gastrointestinal inflammation, severe skin reactions and breathing difficulties. These effects limit a patient's ability to tolerate treatment thereby depriving the patient of the potential benefit of additional treatments or treatment combinations that might otherwise destroy or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Once educated as to the limited efficacy, limited increased survival and potentially significant toxicity of existing treatment alternatives, patients diagnosed with terminal cancer often choose to limit or forego therapy in order to avoid further compromising their quality of life. Patients with advanced stage cancer often cannot tolerate cancer therapy, and certain therapies have been shown to hasten death in some cases as the patient's health deteriorates. 

&#8226; 

Development of resistance. While many current therapeutic approaches may be effective against a particular target, the overall impact of these therapies on treating cancer is limited because the abundance and diversity of tumor cells are believed to enable cancers to adapt and become resistant to these treatments over time resulting in reduced longer-term efficacy. 

&#8226; 

Short-term approach. Incremental survival benefit is the primary objective of many currently marketed and development-stage cancer therapeutics. In general, many drugs show modest impact on overall survival or only affect progression-free survival. Other than surgical tumor removal, curative intent is often not a focus or realistic potential outcome of many current cancer therapies. 

&#8226; 

Immune system suppression. Cancer is difficult to treat in part because cancer cells use sophisticated strategies to evade the immune system. Current approaches to cancer treatment generally involve introduction of an agent, such as a chemical, an antibody or radiation. These agents cause cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) or inhibit the proliferation of all cells, including immune cells, thereby indirectly suppressing the immune system. A weakened immune system not only further inhibits the body's natural ability to fight cancer, but also causes patients to become more susceptible to infections and other diseases. 

Potential Advantages of HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Over Current Cancer Therapies 

We believe our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy has the following potential advantages over existing therapies, which may enable us to develop commercial products that extend both survival and improved quality of life for patients with cancer: 

&#8226; 

Robust, innate immune response. Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology is designed to fight cancer by activating the human body's naturally protective and rapid immune response to the alpha-Gal carbohydrate. 

&#8226; 

Complex, multi-targeted approach. We believe our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology attacks cancer through several mechanisms. Initially, by introducing allogeneic, whole cancer cells incorporating alpha-Gal to the body, our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy is designed to educate the immune system to attack specific cancer cells, such as pancreas, lung or melanoma cancer cells, with both antibody mediated and cellular immune responses. Secondly, by using multiple whole cancer cell lines, our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy targets multiple tumor proteins simultaneously, which we believe increases the probability of stimulating an effective immune response to the heterogeneous cells that are present in cancer. 

&#8226; 

Favorable safety profile. We have not observed significant additional systemic toxicities when HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy has been added to standard chemotherapy or radiation regimens. Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology is designed to stimulate a strong or robust immune response to specific cancer cells while limiting the risks of off-target effects. 

&#8226; 

Broad applicability. We believe that the novel mechanism of action, good tolerability and favorable safety profile will enable our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates to have potential benefits across multiple disease stages and tumor types and in combination with other therapies. 

Our Product Pipeline 

The chart below summarizes our current product candidates and their stages of development. Our product candidate pipeline includes biologic and small molecule immunotherapy product candidates intended to treat a wide range of oncology indications. 

Algenpantucel-L, Our Lead HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Product Candidate 

Our lead HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidate, algenpantucel-L, is an investigational immunotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer. The product consists of two pancreatic cancer cell lines that have been genetically modified to express alpha-Gal carbohydrates on cell surface molecules. We believe that upon injection into the patient, the alpha-Gal stimulates an immune response against pancreatic cancer-specific antigens in the tumor cell lines. The patient&#8217;s immune system then targets the patient's own pancreatic cancer cells, destroying them. In the adjuvant setting, the immune response targets and eradicates residual tumor cells in conjunction with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and chemoradiation. 

Algenpantucel-L is currently being studied in combination with standard of care in two Phase 3 clinical trials: 

&#8226; 

IMPRESS &#32;(IMmunotherapy for Pancreatic REsectable cancer Survival Study) 

&#8226; 

PILLAR &#32;(Pancreatic Immunotherapy with Algenpantucel-L for Locally Advanced non-Resectable) 

Algenpantucel-L has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage I/II resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma in combination with adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy, and Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In May 2010, we initiated IMPRESS, our first Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with surgically-resected pancreatic cancer patients. We completed enrollment in September 2013 with 722 patients. The primary endpoint for our IMPRESS trial with algenpantucel-L for the adjuvant treatment of patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer is overall survival. The first interim analysis was conducted when 222 events (deaths) were reported for the clinical trial, which occurred during the first quarter of 2014. As part of this planned interim analysis, the independent data safety monitoring committee, or DSMC, met to review available patient data. As anticipated, following its review, the DSMC recommended that the clinical trial should proceed as planned, without modification. The second interim analysis was completed during the second quarter of 2015 following 333 events, which had occurred prior to February 26, 2015. For the second interim analysis, the DSMC reviewed available patient data and recommended the clinical trial proceed without modification to final analysis. We previously announced that concurrent with the second interim analysis, a Kaplan-Meier estimation of overall median survival calculated from the same data set determined that the estimated blended median overall survival in the trial from the time of randomization was 28.5 months for all patients. This compares with a long-standing Kaplan-Meier estimated survival of patients with resected pancreatic cancer of approximately 20 months. Median time from surgery to randomization was approximately 1.5 months. Therefore, median survival from surgery was estimated to be approximately 30 months for all patients in our IMPRESS clinical trial. The clinical trial is powered to show an improvement in overall survival after 442 events, and we expect to report primary results in 2016. 

In 2013, we initiated PILLAR, our second Phase 3 clinical trial for algenpantucel-L in patients whose pancreatic cancer is locally advanced. This trial was fully enrolled as of the end of 2015 with just over 300 patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic disease. The primary endpoint for the PILLAR study is overall survival after treatment with a regimen of chemotherapy (either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) with or without algenpantucel-L. 

We initiated these trials based on encouraging interim data from our Phase 2 clinical trial that was fully enrolled in March 2010. At the time of the interim analysis, all patients in this Phase 2 clinical trial had reached at least 24 months of follow-up with a median follow-up period of approximately 33 months. The study met its primary objective with an established median disease-free survival of 14.1 months. The secondary endpoint of overall survival showed one-year overall survival to be 86%. Efficacy data for the 26 patients receiving high dose therapy demonstrated median disease-free survival of 15.3 months and a one-year overall survival rate of 96 percent. Algenpantucel-L has demonstrated good tolerability and a favorable safety profile in the Phase 2 clinical trial. The most common treatment-related adverse reactions (reported by at least 5 percent of patients) for the product candidate included injection site reactions (40%), induration (19%), injection site pain (10%), pyrexia (9%), erythema (7%), fatigue (19%), nausea (6%), lymphopenia (6%) and pruritus (5%). All of these events were grade three or less. The common terminology criteria, or CTC, of the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, categorizes adverse events into five grades, where grade one is mild, grade two is moderate, grade three is severe, grade four is life-threatening and grade five is death. 

Market Opportunity 

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is one of the most difficult cancers to treat. Approximately 53,000 Americans are expected to be newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016, and the incidence rates have been increasing since 2004. A subset of these patients, which we estimate to be 25 to 30%, may be eligible for surgical resection under current practice in the United States. Adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy or chemoradiation is the standard of care post-resection. Despite improvements in treatments median overall survival is 14 to 19 months and the five-year survival rate for these patients remains low at 12 to 18%. 

Current treatment recommendations for locally advanced pancreatic cancer usually include combined modality treatments with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These treatments are rarely effective in shrinking a tumor to the point where it can be 

successfully resected. There is a trend toward using combination regimens that have shown benefits for conversion to resectability and increased survival. However, many of these regimens are associated with considerable toxicity. Treatment recommendations for advanced pancreatic cancer are primarily palliative in nature. There have been limited advances over the past 20 years with the most recent agents approved for use in the United States for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer offering modest survival benefits of approximately two months over previous approaches. There remains a critical need for novel therapies that can improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. 

Phase 3 Clinical Trial (IMPRESS) 

In May 2010, we initiated IMPRESS our first Phase 3 clinical trial for algenpantucel-L. This trial is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial, evaluating 722 patients with Stage I and Stage II surgically-resected pancreatic cancer classified according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification system, or AJCC system, who have no detectable disease by a CT scan. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is overall survival, with secondary endpoints of disease-free survival, safety, toxicity and immunological responses. In September 2013, we completed the enrollment of 722 patients in this clinical trial. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe this number of patients is adequate to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in overall survival at the end of the trial. 

Current adjuvant standard-of-care regimens for post-resection pancreatic cancer patients include gemcitabine alone or a combination of gemcitabine plus 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy. In our Phase 3 clinical trial, 50% of the patients receive standard adjuvant therapy with algenpantucel-L and 50% receive standard adjuvant therapy without algenpantucel-L. Data from our Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival at one year for the high dose (300 million cells) arm of the study. Therefore, we selected the 300 million cell dose as the treatment dose for our Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, considering the observed dose response, we believe a higher number of treatments might provide further benefit. We therefore modified the treatment schedule for all patients receiving algenpantucel-L to increase the number of immunotherapy treatments from 12 to up to 18 treatments given every two weeks over a period of approximately six months followed by six monthly injections. Patients in the study are being monitored with periodic imaging to check for recurrences for at least five years after surgery or until death occurs. 

The clinical trial included interim evaluations for overall survival when approximately one-half of the expected number of deaths had occurred and, again when approximately three-quarters of the expected number of deaths had occurred. The first interim analysis occurred in the first quarter of 2014, and the DSMC determined to continue. The second interim analyses of data from this study occurred in the second quarter of 2015, and the DSMC recommended the study proceed without modification until final analysis. We subsequently reported that the projected combined median overall survival of the IMPRESS trial was 28.5 months from randomization and approximately 30 months from surgery. The clinical trial is powered to show an improvement in overall survival after the anticipated 442 events, and we expect to report primary results in 2016. 

When initially diagnosed, patients eligible for our Phase 3 clinical trial had localized tumors that could potentially be completely removed based upon strict imaging criteria. In addition, the patients were generally strong enough to survive a major surgical procedure that involves an inherent significant risk of death. Patients were not eligible to participate in this trial until pathology and post-operative imaging studies indicate that they were without clinical evidence of residual tumor as observed by a CT scan. As a result, patients admitted to the trials had minimal residual tumor burden and possessed generally intact immune systems, characteristics that we believe may improve the likelihood of meaningful outcome. 

Phase 3 Clinical Trial (PILLAR) 

The recent emergence of combination therapy with FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, 5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) or gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel has been promising in the metastatic disease and both regimens are being tested extensively in the locally advanced disease setting. We believe that the addition of algenpantucel-L immunotherapy to FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy has the potential to improve survival of patients in this population. To assess this potential treatment combination we initiated PILLAR, our second Phase 3 clinical trial that will assess overall survival after treatment with a regimen of FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel with or without algenpantucel-L immunotherapy in subjects who have borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. In addition to overall survival, secondary endpoints include assessment of progression free survival and correlative scientific studies of subject samples to determine the mechanism of any observed anti-tumor effect. In these studies human humoral and cellular immune responses to algenpantucel-L will be evaluated. 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

We have completed an open-label, two-armed Phase 2 clinical trial, referred to as NLG-0205, in which algenpantucel-L was given in doses of either 100 million cells or 300 million cells approximately twice monthly for six months in combination 

with the standard-of-care treatment regimen, which consisted of gemcitabine chemotherapy plus 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy. We enrolled patients for this clinical trial at 16 different sites in the United States. Patients in this clinical trial had been diagnosed with Stage I and Stage II pancreatic adenocarcinoma, according to the AJCC system, and subsequently underwent surgical resection to remove all visible tumors with curative intent. There were no other exclusion criteria relative to pre-operative disease status. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial was to evaluate disease-free survival with secondary endpoints of overall survival and toxicity. We also wanted to determine if a superior dosing regimen could be identified. 

We enrolled 44 patients in the 100 million cell dose cohort, or low dose group, and 26 patients in the 300 million cell dose cohort, or high dose group. The baseline patient characteristics of both cohorts were similar in terms of age, gender and disease state. Patient enrollment was complete in March 2010. 

As of June 2012, all patients had reached at least 24 months of follow-up with a median follow-up period of approximately 33 months. To date, algenpantucel-L has demonstrated good tolerability and a favorable safety profile. The most common non-serious adverse events observed were fatigue, local injection site skin reactions and injection site pain. The nature and frequency of the adverse events observed in this clinical trial are consistent with the adverse events observed in all clinical trials for other HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies. The study met its primary objective with an established median disease-free survival (DFS) of 14.1 months. The analyses of the secondary endpoint of overall survival for the entire study showed one-year overall survival of 86 percent and a Kaplan-Meier estimate predicts a median overall survival at 24.1 months. Subgroup analysis showed that patients receiving 300 million cells/dose had a 12-month DFS of 81 percent while those receiving 100 million cells/dose had a 12-month DFS of 51 percent (p=0.02, Fisher's exact), and a one-year overall survival rate of 96 percent and 79 percent for the respective cohorts. 

These results compare favorably to the outcomes of prior clinical trials in surgically-resected pancreatic cancer patients. Of these clinical trials, we believe the study known as RTOG 97-04, a 538-patient (451 evaluable patients) clinical trial conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, is the most comparable with respect to baseline patient characteristics and treatment regimen even though our trial population had a higher frequency of lymphatic node invasion (68% vs. 81% in our trial). One treatment arm in RTOG 97-04 received gemcitabine chemotherapy plus 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy, which is the current standard-of-care treatment regimen, and we believe this treatment arm provides the best comparison to our NLG-0205 study. In RTOG 97-04, the 221 patients in the standard-of-care treatment arm had one-year disease-free survival of less than 50 percent and a one-year overall survival rate of 69 percent based on Kaplan-Meier analysis. 

Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Overall Survival in our Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

Kaplan-Meier analysis is a statistical method of predicting survival rates using study survival data. Nomogram analysis is a method for determining expected survival rates using patient baseline characteristics and other prognostic indicators. As shown in the graph below, the Kaplan-Meier-calculated overall survival in our Phase 2 clinical trial compares favorably to projected survival calculated by nomogram analysis. 

Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival for 

NLG-0205 Versus Expected Distribution 

The dotted line represents projected survival of patients enrolled in NLG-0205 based on the prognostic Brennan et al. Nomogram ( Brennan et al., Ann Surg, 2004, 240:293 ), also known as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram. The solid blue line represents the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curve for patients enrolled in NLG-0205 as of June 2012. At 12 months after surgery overall survival for the combined patient population in NLG-0205 is 86%. The observed median overall survival is 24.1 months for the combined patient population in NLG-0205 versus 16.6 months predicted by the Brennan et.al. Nomogram. 

Data from the NLG-0205 study has been stratified into high dose and low dose groups on the basis of statistically significant differential responses to algenpantucel-L immunotherapy. We believe 300 million cells is the largest practically attainable treatment dose based on clinician observation; however, we have tested a 100 million cell dose as a means to reduce the number of injections needed during therapy. The patterns of response in patients treated with these two doses have become distinct during the study. 

Patients in the high dose group of NLG-0205 demonstrated an improved disease-free survival compared to patients in the low dose group or the current standard-of-care RTOG 97-04 chemoradiotherapy protocol alone. The data from NLG-0205 demonstrate a statistically significant difference between high and low dose groups in terms of disease-free survival (p=0.02). 

In addition, an increased overall survival at one year for 300 million cell dose patients compared to low dose patients was observed (96% vs. 79%, p=0.053). These data demonstrate that patients in the high dose group have both a higher disease-free survival and a trend towards higher overall survival at one year compared to patients in the low dose group. Notably, patients treated at both dose levels in NLG-0205 compare favorably to the 63% one-year overall survival calculated by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram analysis of the NLG-0205 patient population. Furthermore, both dose levels in NLG-0205 compare favorably to the 69% one-year overall survival observed for the 221 patients who received gemcitabine plus 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy in the RTOG 97-04 study.

Disease-free survival at one year was not reported. However, from the median disease-free survival of 11.4 months, we have inferred that disease-free survival at one year is less than 50%. 

Analysis of Historical Controls 

Baseline patient characteristics are key factors to consider in reviewing clinical trials. Not all patients have an identical disease state and, in the context of surgically-resected pancreatic cancer patients, certain patient characteristics have been shown to have a significant impact on a patient's prognosis of disease progression and survival. Prognostic indicators for Stage I/II pancreatic cancer have been analyzed during the development of the AJCC system. The principal prognostic indicators have been validated and demonstrate that baseline data on tumors, nodal involvement and metastasis inform meaningful predictions of likely outcomes for patients. These characteristics include: 

&#8226; 

Nodal status: refers to the presence of cancer in the nearby lymph nodes. When cancer enters the lymph nodes, there is an increased risk that the cancer will spread, or metastasize, to other regions of the body via the lymphatic system. As such, nodal status is an indicator of disease progression and thereby a prognostic indicator of survival. A study completed by Hsu et al. and published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology in 2010 reported that resected pancreatic cancer patients who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with positive lymph nodes prior to resection had a median overall survival 8.5 months less than that of patients with negative nodes. Further, a study conducted by Lim et al. published in Annals of Surgery in 2003 demonstrated that patients with greater than four positive lymph nodes had median overall survival 9.4 months less than that of patients with no positive lymph nodes. 

&#8226; 

Degree of local invasion: refers to the extension of tumors into peripancreatic tissues including neural, vascular, or lymphatic structures or surrounding organs. Larger, higher-staged tumors are associated with a higher degree of local invasion, advanced disease and a poorer prognosis. As it relates to pancreatic cancer, patients with smaller, less invasive tumors have a greater median overall survival as reported by Gebhardt et al. in Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery in 2000. In the Gebhardt study, patients with pancreatic cancer that had invaded the lymph vessels, blood vessels and perineural tissues had a median overall survival of 16.8 months, 7.2 months and 4.8 months less, respectively, than patients with cancer that had not invaded these tissues. 

&#8226; 

Tumor stage: refers to the size and peripancreatic extension of pancreatic cancer. T1 is defined as less than two centimeters in diameter and limited to the pancreas; T2 is defined as greater than two centimeters in diameter and limited to the pancreas; T3 is defined as a tumor that has extended beyond the pancreas; and T4 tumors are defined as unresectable. The T3 tumor stage is associated with poorer prognosis and increased risk of death compared to T1-T2 tumors in resected pancreatic cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemoradiotherapy as reported by Hsu et al., where T3 patients had a median overall survival that was 8.3 months less than T1-T2 patients. 

&#8226; 

Tumor grade: refers to abnormalities of cancer cells relative to healthy cells. Tumor cells considered undifferentiated, or having a higher tumor grade, have little to no resemblance to the cells from which they originated (in this case pancreatic cells). Tumors classified as G1 or G2 are considered low grade tumors with well and moderately differentiated cells, respectively. Tumors classified as G3 or G4 are considered high grade tumors with poorly or undifferentiated cells, respectively. Many factors are considered in determining tumor grade, including the structure and growth pattern of the cells. Tumor grade is determined by a pathologist via biopsy of the tumor. Higher degrees of cancer cell abnormality are associated with a poorer disease prognosis; in fact, high tumor grade is an independent predictor of survival. The study conducted by Lim et al. referred to above showed that patients with poorly differentiated (G3), or higher grade, tumors of the pancreas had median overall survival of 22.8 months less than patients with well differentiated (G1), or lower grade, tumors. 

&#8226; 

Ca 19-9 markers: refers to the post-operative concentration of the tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9. The concentration of Ca 19-9 markers is associated with significant risk of early, distant metastasis. A study conducted by Kinsella et al. published in American Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2008 reported that pancreatic cancer patients with high post-operative Ca 19-9 levels, defined as greater than 70 units per milliliter, had a median overall survival 16.8 month less than patients with Ca 19-9 marker levels lower than 70 units per milliliter. 

Our Phase 2 clinical trial did not compare the outcomes of patients who received algenpantucel-L plus the standard-of-care treatment regimen to the standard-of-care alone. Therefore, we believe it is important to evaluate the patient characteristics and clinical results of NLG-0205 relative to those of prior clinical trials in surgically-resected pancreatic cancer patients.

U.S.-based comparator studies 

In terms of historical comparisons between NLG-0205 and other resectable pancreatic cancer trials with curative intent, we believe RTOG 97-04 represents the most appropriate comparator study. This clinical trial enrolled 538 patients at 164 U.S. and Canadian institutions from July 1998 to July 2002 with follow-up through August 2006. The objective of RTOG 97-04 was to determine if the addition of gemcitabine to adjuvant 5-FU chemoradiation would improve survival for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In their primary analysis of a 451 patient sub-population, 221 of which received gemcitabine, the RTOG 97-04 investigators determined that the addition of gemcitabine to adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiation was associated with a survival benefit for patients with resected pancreatic cancer, although this benefit was not statistically significant. Based on the subpopulation analysis of this study, we believe that this study demonstrated limited benefit. The results of RTOG 97-04 were presented at the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncologists, or ASCO, annual meeting and published in JAMA &#32;in March 2008. 

Because comparisons between specific studies can have limited validity, researchers have developed statistical tools to evaluate the likely impact of therapies on overall survival. One such tool is the Brennan et. al. Nomogram developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for surgically resected Stage I/II patients based on the interaction of baseline patient characteristics and other prognostic indicators. 

Among the U.S.-based comparator studies, RTOG 97-04 baseline patient characteristics are the most similar to NLG-0205 baseline patient characteristics; both studies enrolled patients primarily at major medical centers in the United States, and NLG-0205 incorporates the addition of algenpantucel-L to a chemoradiotherapy protocol highly similar to that used in RTOG 97-04. As calculated by applying Brennan et. al. Nomogram analysis to the patient characteristics and other prognostic indicators of the respective studies, the projected overall survival of patients in the RTOG 97-04 study is higher than the projected overall survival of patients in the NLG-0205 study. 

Tergenpumatucel-L HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Product Candidate 

Tergenpumatucel-L is our investigational HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC. The product candidate consists of three NSCLC cell lines that have been genetically modified to express alpha-Gal carbohydrates on cell surface molecules. Upon injection into the patient, the alpha-Gal is intended to stimulate a rapid and powerful immune response against NSCLC-specific antigens in the tumor cell lines. We believe the patient&#8217;s immune system then targets the patient's own NSCLC cancer cells, destroying them. In a Phase 2b clinical trial in progressive or relapsed NSCLC, two different dosing schedules of tergenpumatucel-L are currently being compared to docetaxel with a primary endpoint of overall survival. This study is also evaluating the potential for chemosensitization to salvage regimens post tergenpumatucel-L exposure. 

Market Opportunity 

According to the American Cancer Society, NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States, with more than 150,000 Americans expected to die from this devastating disease in 2016. Of more than 200,000 

newly diagnosed patients expected in 2016, approximately 57% will present with metastatic disease, for which there are significant limitations in treatment options. Despite advancements being made with new treatment strategies in NSCLC, survival outcomes remain poor. The five-year survival rate for Stage IIIA NSCLC is about 14%. For stage IIIB cancers the survival rate is about 5%. NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body is often hard to treat. Metastatic, or Stage IV NSCLC, has a five-year survival rate of about 1%, which underscores a need for innovative therapies. 

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial 

Tergenpumatucel-L was studied in a Phase 1/2, single-arm, open-label clinical trial that fully enrolled with 54 patients at the National Cancer Institute, or NCI. This clinical trial was for patients with refractory, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC. Its primary endpoint was to assess tumor response rate after administration of tergenpumatucel-L, and the secondary endpoint was to assess overall survival. For the Phase 1 portion of this clinical trial, a positive response included stable disease for 16 weeks in patients who had enrolled after having previously shown progressive disease. A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the Phase 1 portion and 37 patients in the Phase 2 portion. Of the 37 patients enrolled in Phase 2, only 28 were evaluated for clinical response. In Phase 1, four cohorts of patients each received injections of 3 million, 10 million, 30 million, or 100 million cells every four weeks for four doses, and one cohort of three patients received an initial dose of 500 million cells, followed by injections of 300 million cells every two weeks for up to seven doses. In Phase 2, the 28 patients evaluated received injections of 300 million cells every two weeks for up to eight doses. 

The Phase 1 results of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our tergenpumatucel-L immunotherapy reported a favorable safety profile, with no dose limiting toxicities at any of the five escalating dose levels. There have been no reported CTC grade four adverse events attributed to tergenpumatucel-L. The most common treatment-related adverse reactions (reported by at least 5% of patients) for tergenpumatucel-L, were injection site reaction (88%), induration (51%), fatigue (25%), urticaria (10%), anemia (5%), pruritus (7%), lymphopenia (7%), elevated serum amylase (5%), edema (5%), skin pain (5%) and dyspnea (5%). The clinical trial involved a dose escalation from approximately three million up to 300 million cells in repeat dosing. Only a single dose escalation has been required by the FDA in all subsequent clinical trials of our other HyperAcute candidates conducted to date. 

Results of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for tergenpumatucel-L, based on the analysis of 45 patients, were encouraging. As of January 2012, the results for the 28 patients evaluated in the Phase 2 clinical trial group showed a median progression-free survival of 3.4 months, median overall survival of 11.3 months, and a one-year survival rate of 46%. Median overall survival data from the Phase 2 clinical trial group was better than the Phase 1 clinical trial group (11.3 versus 7.6 months), a comparison that would be consistent with study drug dose dependency. 

Immunological studies showed that tergenpumatucel-L induced the increase of IFN-gamma secreted post immunization by peripheral blood lymphocytes in 11 of 18 tested patients. Patients that responded with increased IFN-gamma secretion post immunization had significantly increased overall survival when compared to non-responding patients (21.9 vs 7.2 months p=0.044). 

Prior Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that in the refractory, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC setting (second line therapy), the median overall survival of patients receiving best supportive care was 4.6 months and the median overall survival of patients receiving pemetrexed or docetaxel therapy was approximately eight months. The following table shows comparative results for second-line treatment in advanced NSCLC with pemetrexed, docetaxel and tergenpumatucel-L.

Data from NLG-0101 tergenpumatucel-L clinical trial, Patients 18-45 

Given the favorable safety profile of tergenpumatucel-L, and the 11.3 month median overall survival observed in the Phase 2 study, tergenpumatucel-L compares favorably to current standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy. 

In 2013, enrollment started on our Phase 2b clinical trial in NSCLC. Additionally, we have begun enrollment in a second trial evaluating tergenpumatucel-L. This Phase 1b/2 clinical trial is evaluating the combination of tergenpumatucel-L with indoximod and docetaxel for patients with advanced NSCLC. 

Dorgenmeltucel-L HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Product Candidate 

Dorgenmeltucel-L is our investigational HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy for patients with advanced melanoma. The product consists of three melanoma tumor cell lines that have been genetically modified to express alpha-Gal carbohydrates on cell surface molecules. Upon injection into the patient, the alpha-Gal stimulates a rapid and powerful immune response against melanoma-specific antigens in the tumor cell lines. We believe the patient&#8217;s immune system then targets the patient's own melanoma cancer cells, destroying them. Dorgenmeltucel-L was studied in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial in 25 patients with advanced melanoma. In this trial, dorgenmeltucel-L was administered intradermally with an eight-week course of PEG-Intron, a man-made immune modulator that has been tested for the treatment of melanoma. 

Market Opportunity 

According to the American Cancer Society, the incidence of melanoma in the United States has been increasing for the last 30 years. Most cases of melanoma (84%) are diagnosed at an early stage, when curative treatment with surgical excision is possible. However, melanoma can recur after surgery, and about 13% of patients present with regionally advanced or metastatic disease. For patients with stage IIIC disease, five-year survival has been reported to be 40%. Only 15-20% of patients with metastatic disease will survive for five years or more. 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial 

We provided drug and financial support for a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical trial studying the combination of dorgenmeltucel-L with an eight week course of PEG-Intron for patients with advanced melanoma. The trial completed enrolling 25 patients in September 2010. The treatment consisted of 12 weekly intradermal injections of dorgenmeltucel-L at 150 million cells per dose with PEG-Intron co-administered in weeks five through 12. This was the first time that one of our HyperAcute immunotherapies was combined with another approved immunotherapy, in this case PEG-Intron. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to conduct correlative scientific studies of patient tumor and peripheral blood samples to determine the mechanism of any observed anti-tumor effect involving the innate and cell-mediated host immune response to dorgenmeltucel-L alone and combined with PEG-Intron. Although the number of patients in this clinical trial is modest, the results to date are encouraging. 

As of June 2012, vitiligo had been observed in four out of 25 (16%) patients. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the patients immune system attacks melanoctyes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation and potential melanoma cancer cells. Two prior clinical trials of immunotherapies conducted by others suggest that the development of vitiligo was correlated with a favorable response to therapy in melanoma patients. All patients evaluated developed autoimmune antibodies. Other than vitiligo, no other clinically apparent autoimmune disorder has been reported in any patient to date. These observations suggest an immunological response to the dorgenmeltucel-L. Dorgenmeltucel-L has been reported as well tolerated, with no systemic, drug-related serious adverse events characterized by the investigators as possibly or probably attributable to our product candidate. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported, regardless of relationship to drug, included injection site reactions (92%), induration (76%), pruritis (16%), fatigue (52%), fever (32%), diarrhea (52%), nausea (44%), vomiting (8%), rigors or chills (8%), head pain (52%), muscle pain (52%) and anorexia (28%). By Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST criteria, of 16 stage IV melanoma patients, there were two complete responders (CR), two with stable disease (SD) and two with no evidence of disease (NED) after resection. For the one stage II and eight stage III patients, three of nine (3/9) remain NED, with one patient with slowly progressive disease remaining alive at 30 months. The median overall survival is 29 months, with 50% of the patients surviving for two years. In conclusion, combination immunotherapy with dorgenmeltucel-L plus PEG-Intron shows signs of clinical efficacy with tumor regression and concomitant immune activation. 

We are currently enrolling a Phase 2 clinical trial of dorgenmeltucel-L in combination with commercially available checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab for patients with advanced melanoma. The design is a randomized Phase 2 design that compares dorgenmeltucel-L combined with the current standard of care checkpoint inhibitors to checkpoint inhibitors alone. We used the statistically significant improvements in outcomes resulting from higher doses in our Phase 2 clinical trials with algenpantucel-L to inform our Phase 2 combination trial. Specifically, in the Phase 2 clinical trial of dorgenmeltucel-L, we employed a weekly dose of 150 million cells for 12 weeks during the course of the treatment. Due to the statistically significant improvement in disease free survival reported with high versus low dose in our trials of algenpantucel-L for patients 

with resected pancreatic cancer, we are now using a higher dose and a longer treatment duration in our current dorgenmeltucel-L clinical trials. 

Other HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy Product Candidates and Indications 

We believe we have developed a process to efficiently discover and develop new tumor-specific HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies for patients with other solid tumor types. We initiated development for our HyperAcute Prostate, HyperAcute Breast and HyperAcute Renal product candidates and are developing our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology for other indications. 

IDO Pathway Inhibitor Product Candidates 

We have an active drug discovery and clinical development program focused on the IDO and TDO pathways. Our IDO/TDO pathway inhibitors represent a key class of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are regarded as potential breakthrough approaches to cancer therapy. In October 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Genentech, for the development and commercialization of GDC-0919, and a research collaboration for the discovery of next generation IDO and TDO pathway inhibitors. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $150 million. We may be eligible to receive in excess of $1 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain predetermined milestones as well as escalating royalties on potential commercial sales of multiple products by Genentech. We did not license indoximod under the Genentech Agreement, and we expect to continue its development. Indoximod is in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of patients with breast, prostate, pancreas and brain cancers. 

Phase 1B/2 Clinical Trials 

I ndoximod has successfully completed initial Phase 1 development. Phase 1 studies evaluating indoximod were done in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis and enrolled a total of 65 patients. Indoximod was well tolerated and a Ready for Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was determined. No dose limiting toxicities were observed. Under the same partnership, a Phase 1b clinical trial of indoximod in combination with docetaxel for patients with advanced solid tumors was performed. The combination was well tolerated, a Phase 2 dose for the combination was determined, and clinical responses were observed. 

Currently, indoximod is in being developed by us in a variety of combinations across several cancer indications: 

&#8226; 

NLG2101 Phase 2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with taxane chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer was fully enrolled as of the end of 2015. We expect to report additional progress in 2016. 

&#8226; 

NLG2102 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with temozolomide for patients with refractory malignant brain tumors. 

&#9702; 

Phase 1b portion results were reported in 2015 and confirmed the combination has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrated preliminary clinical activity of the combination therapy. 

&#9702; 

Phase 2 portion is currently enrolling. We expect to report additional progress in 2016. 

&#8226; 

NLG2103 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma. 

&#9702; 

Phase 1b portion results were reported in 2015 and confirmed the combination has an acceptable safety profile. 

&#8226; 

NLG2014 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 

&#9702; 

Phase 1b portion results were reported in 2016 and confirmed the combination has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrated preliminary clinical activity. 

&#8226; 

NLG2105 Phase 1 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with temozolomide for pediatric patients with refractory malignant brain tumors. 

Infectious Disease 

Our infectious disease program is based upon two core technologies, each of which can be leveraged into the infectious disease or biodefense fields. The first technology is replication competent recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, or rVSV, an advanced vaccine technology developed for the Ebola and Marburg viruses and licensed from the Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC. In November 2014, we entered into the Merck Agreement to develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. We received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in 2014, and a milestone payment of $20.0 million in 2015 and we have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and Merck successfully commercializes it. The Company announced on July 31, 2015 that 

the international partnership studying the rVSV-EBOV vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola in a large Phase 3 clinical trial. According to the announcement, the interim results suggest that the vaccine candidate demonstrates efficacy within about 10 days of administration to a person without the infection. The rVSV-EBOV product candidate will continue to be studied in clinical trials. 

The second technology is our HyperAcute immunotherapy technology, which is currently focused on enhancing vaccines for influenza. We have been investigating HyperAcute recombinant vaccine product candidates using H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses in animal experiments. Other HyperAcute recombinant infectious disease vaccines are currently under investigation. 

In February 2016, we announced our initiative to develop for a vaccine against the Zika virus. The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. In January 2016, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus an international public health emergency. There is no current vaccine and no course of treatment for the Zika virus. 

Grants and Contracts with the United States Government 

Other than the upfront payments received in 2014 from Genentech and Merck, grants and contracts with the United States Government accounted for substantially all of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years. In December 2014, we announced that &#32; BARDA had awarded us a contract, as the prime contractor, in the amount of $30 million to support the manufacturing and development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate, including clinical development through a new 330-person Phase 1b clinical trial. In October 2015, we announced that BARDA had exercised an $18 million option on our existing contract to support the scale-up of the manufacturing process related to our Ebola vaccine product candidate. We have also received funding from the United States Department of Defense to support the development of contract manufacturing for the vaccine product candidate for clinical trials. We were awarded funds of $6.4 million from DTRA under the initial base contract and additions to this contract during 2014. In September 2015, DTRA awarded us another $8.1 million base contract with future options totaling $5.2 million to support various development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate. 

Manufacturing 

We manufacture our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies at our facilities in Ames, Iowa. We believe this facility is adequate to supply all of the Phase 3 clinical trial drug requirements for at least two HyperAcute product candidates. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with WuXi to produce algenpantucel-L in bulk quantities for the commercial market. When and if algenpantucel-L is approved, we expect to manufacture it in bulk quantities at our Ames facility. WuXi is building capacity and working with us to validate its processes and equipment in the event that clinical data will support an application to FDA for approval of algenpantucel-L. We have established our own facility in Ankeny, Iowa to manage the final production steps, including irradiation and packaging, and to distribute our potential vaccine drug products, if any are approved. 

We currently contract with Regis Technologies, Inc. and with University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals for the manufacture of our indoximod drug substance and drug product, respectively. We believe that many suppliers would be available for the production of this product, if required. We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing capacity to support this product. 

Genentech will be responsible for the manufacturing of GDC-0919 and any other drug candidate developed in accordance with the Genentech Agreement. 

We have entered into an agreement with an established contract manufacturing organization to produce our Ebola vaccine product candidate. After a transition period and subject to conditions, Merck will assume responsibility for manufacturing the Ebola vaccine product candidate in accordance with the Merck Agreement. 

Sales and Marketing 

We currently own exclusive worldwide commercial rights to our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy and indoximod product candidates. We are currently building a commercial infrastructure to support any of these products, should they receive FDA authorization for marketing and sales in the United States. In 2014, we established an office in Austin, Texas to serve as the headquarters for our commercial organization. In addition, we may pursue collaborations or co-promotion arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to complement these efforts or for particular indications or in specific territories. 

We intend that our commercial infrastructure will be a fully integrated and highly experienced team, consisting of sales, marketing, medical affairs, market access and other positions necessary for a successful product launch in the U.S. market. Our 

lead product candidate, algenpantucel-L is anticipated to be approved for patients with resected pancreatic cancer. We anticipate that a moderately sized, focused and highly experienced sales team will be sufficient to reach key institutions and cancer centers treating this subset of patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Additional support for our commercialization efforts may be provided by both medical affairs and market access professionals, who will provide the needed medical education, reimbursement support and other key functions needed to support an oncology product launch in the United States. We anticipate the need to hire personnel in advance of the approval of any of our product candidates and in 2015, hired key personnel in medical and clinical affairs, market access, and marketing to prepare for a possible launch of algenpantucel-L. 

Outside the United States we will either commercialize and distribute approved products independently or establish partnerships to address specific needs as we have with Genentech and Merck for our other product candidates. 

Competition 

The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Given the significant unmet patient need for new therapies, oncology is an area of focus for many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of products for cancer. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new oncology products. In addition, there are a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same cancer indications as our product candidates. 

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 

We also face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and developing and acquiring technologies, obtaining patent protection, and securing sufficient capital resources for the often lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sales. Moreover, technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors, thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We will also compete for the services of third parties that may have already developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies to target the diseases on which we have focused both inside and outside of the United States. 

Immunotherapy Products for Cancer 

The cancer immunotherapy landscape is broad but still in the early stages of development as compared to more established approaches like cytotoxic chemotherapy. Several immunotherapy approaches to cancer have been approved in recent years. As a class of therapeutics, only one FDA-approved active cellular immunotherapy product has been approved to date. Three drugs classified as checkpoint inhibitors have been approved since 2011 targeting either CTLA-4 or PD-1 via antibody blockade. Additionally, one oncolytic virus therapy has been approved. The indications for which these agents have been approved include some indications which we are pursuing such as melanoma and NSCLC. Other indications, such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and malignant brain tumors, do not currently have any FDA approved immunotherapy approaches. 

We face intense competition in our development activities. We face competition from many companies in the United States and abroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, firms specialized in the development and production of vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and other immunotherapies, and major universities and research institutions. The competitors of which we are aware that have initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial or have obtained marketing approval for a potentially competitive drug to our lead product candidate, algenpantucel-L for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected pancreatic cancer, include Astra-Zeneca, Celgene Corporation, Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and Aduro Biotech. Our competitors in the field of immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines include AdaptImmune LLC, Aduro Biotech, Advaxis, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., Incyte Corporation, Merck &#38; Co., Inc., Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd, and Sanofi SA, among others. Many other companies are developing or commercializing products in areas that we have targeted for product development. Some of these products use therapeutic approaches that may compete directly with our drug candidates. Most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our competitors have 

significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of drug candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our drug candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience. 

Strategic Collaborations 

Genentech Agreement 

In October 2014, we entered into the Genentech Agreement for the development and commercialization of GDC-0919, our clinical stage IDO pathway inhibitor, and a research collaboration for the discovery of next generation IDO/TDO inhibitors to be developed and commercialized under the Genentech Agreement. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $150 million. We may be eligible to receive in excess of $1 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain predetermined development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as escalating royalties on potential commercial sales of multiple products by Genentech. The rates of such royalties will vary based on the stage of the compound at the signing of the Collaboration Agreement, regulatory exclusivity, intellectual property status, and other considerations. 

Genentech will be responsible for and will fund future research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of GDC-0919 and next generation IDO/TDO compounds. Genentech will also provide us with funding to support our participation in the research collaboration. We have the right to continue to pursue development activities associated with the combination of GDC-0919 with our novel HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform. Additionally, we have retained the option under the Genentech Agreement to co-promote GDC-0919 and next generation IDO/TDO products with Genentech in the United States, subject to certain conditions, if and when such products are approved for sale. 

Under the Genentech Agreement, we granted to Genentech an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain of our patents and know-how relating to IDO/TDO, and we have agreed to work exclusively with Genentech with respect to IDO/TDO compounds for a specified number of years. 

Unless earlier terminated, the Genentech Agreement will continue in effect for as long as Genentech has payment obligations to us. Each party may terminate the Genentech Agreement for the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach of the Genentech Agreement or the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or insolvency. After the end of the research collaboration, Genentech may terminate the Genentech Agreement for convenience upon 180 days written notice. 

We have retained all rights to indoximod, our proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor, including the ability to develop, commercialize, license and divest indoximod in our discretion. 

Merck Agreement 

In November 2014, we entered into the Merck Agreement to research, develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. The Ebola vaccine product candidate was originally developed by PHAC. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30 million in 2014 and a milestone payment of $20 million in 2015, and we have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and if Merck successfully commercializes it. In July 2015, we announced that the international partnership studying the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola) vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola in a large Phase 3 clinical trial. According to the announcement, the interim results suggest that the vaccine candidate demonstrates efficacy within about 10 days of administration to a person without the infection. The rVSV-ZEBOV product candidate will continue to be studied in clinical trials. 

Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, Merck is granted the exclusive rights to the Ebola vaccine product candidate, as well as any follow-on products. The Ebola vaccine product candidate is under an exclusive licensing arrangement with BioProtection Systems, our wholly owned subsidiary and a licensee of PHAC. Under these license arrangements, PHAC retains non-commercial rights pertaining to the vaccine candidate. 

Unless earlier terminated, the Merck Agreement will continue in effect for as long as Merck has royalty payment obligations to us. Merck may terminate the Merck Agreement for convenience upon a specified period of notice or for certain safety reasons with immediate effect. In the event of Merck&#8217;s uncured material breach of its obligations under the Merck Agreement with respect to a particular product, we may terminate the Merck Agreement with respect to that product. We may also terminate the Merck 

Agreement with respect to certain products in the event Merck pursues an alternate product under certain circumstances. Each party may terminate the Merck Agreement for the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or insolvency. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that patent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain our technology licenses, maintain trade secret protection, obtain and maintain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. We believe that obtaining identical patents and protection periods for a given technology throughout all markets of the world will be difficult because of differences in patent laws. In addition, the protection provided by non-U.S. patents, if any, may be weaker than that provided by U.S. patents. We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for our HyperAcute technology and our IDO pathway inhibitor technology in the United States and abroad. As of December 31, 2015, our patent portfolio included ten patent families relating to our HyperAcute technology and twenty-two patent families relating to our IDO pathway inhibitor technology. 

There is one principal family of patents and patent applications relating to our HyperAcute product candidates and HyperAcute technology. That patent family is exclusively licensed from Central Iowa Health System and includes two pending patent applications and 23 registered U.S. and foreign patents related to the HyperAcute technology. This patent family is expected to provide basic composition of matter patent protection and methods of manufacturing and use of such compositions extending until 2024 and has already resulted in granted patents in U.S. (US 7,763,641, US 8,551,474 and US 8,535,658), Europe (EP 1549353 B1), Mexico (278681), Japan (4966496) and Canada (2501744), all covering pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting pre-established tumor growth comprising attenuated allogeneic tumor cells modified with alpha-Gal. Similar composition claims as well as methods of use for treating pre-established tumors are currently being further pursued in the U.S. and China. 

We exclusively license from Central Iowa Health System or own several other patents relating to alpha-Gal technology, which we believe provide additional barriers to entry in the space occupied by our HyperAcute technology. Additional coverage includes issued patents relating to gene therapy technology and the use of xenogeneic cells having alpha-Gal expiring in 2016 (US 7,005,126); and four applications issued in the United States (US Patents No. 7,998,486, 8,357,777, 8,916,169 and 9,090,643) and two pending applications in both the United States and Europe covering isolated tumor antigens comprising alpha-Gal residues. The issued United States patents expire in 2029, 2027, 2028 and 2017, respectively, while the pending applications are projected to expire in 2027. Additional patent applications have been filed covering the use of carbohydrate-modified glycoproteins (PCT/US2014/025702, PCT/US2013/026271) and US 13/463,420, and correlates of efficacy to tumor vaccine (PCT/US2014/038231). 

A family of patents, which relate to the use of alpha-Gal in viral and cancer vaccines and which was previously a second principal family of patents for our HyperAcute product candidates and HyperAcute technology, has mostly expired. The last remaining patent in such family, U.S. Patent No. 5,879,675, will expire in March 2016 and our exclusive license from Drexel University to such patent family will automatically terminate at such time. 

Our IDO pathway inhibitor technology patent portfolio contains several key U.S. patent families exclusively licensed from Augusta University Research Institute, formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. and the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute. The first patent family contains five issued U.S. patents expiring in 2018, 2019 and 2021. This family contains patents having claims to pharmaceutical compositions of 1-methyl-tryptophan (US 8,198,265), methods of increasing T cell activation (US 6,451,840) and methods of augmenting rejection of tumor cells (US 6,482,416) by administering an IDO inhibitor. The second patent family contains three issued U.S. patents directed to pharmaceutical compositions of indoximod (US 8,232,313, expires in 2024) and to methods of using indoximod to treat cancer (US 7,598,287 and US 8,580,844 expires in 2027and 2025, respectively). Related applications directed to the use of indoximod to activate T cells are granted in Australia and Canada (AU 2008200315 B2 and CA 2483451 C). 

We believe that significant barriers to entry in the IDO space are provided by three key patent families covering compositions of matter and methods of use of different classes of IDO inhibitor compounds are fully owned by us: 1) PCT/US2008/085167 with granted applications in Europe (EP2227233), China, Japan and Hong Kong; 2) PCT/US2010/054289, with granted patents in the US (8,722,720), and pending in Europe and Canada; and 3) PCT/US2012/033245, which covers the IDO inhibitor compound GDC-0919, currently in clinical development, and its national counterparts are set to provide protection at least until 2032. This patent has been granted in Australia, New Zealand and Japan and allowed in US, Europe and Israel with multiple applications pending in other countries. Additional barriers to entry are provided through exclusive licenses with Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, or LIMR, and various NewLink-owned inventions, in which we are pursuing patent protection for specific combination therapies targeting the IDO pathway, as well as protection for novel families of inhibitor compounds and second generation products. Four patent families that cover different classes of IDO inhibitor compounds and methods of treatment of cancer have been licensed from LIMR and are represented by several international pending cases and the issued patents US 7,714,139, US 8,476,454, CA 2520586, US 7,705,022, US 8,008,281, JP 4921965, CN ZL200480014321.1, CA 2520172, US 

8,383,613, US 8,389,568. An additional patent family co-owned by us and LIMR covers compositions and methods of use of another family of IDO inhibitor compounds (PCT/US2009/041609, with issued patents US 8,748,469, China 102083429 and pending applications in Europe and Japan). 

In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of confidential information. The agreements also oblige our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign or license to us ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. We cannot be sure that these agreements will maintain confidentiality, will prevent disclosure, or will protect our proprietary information or intellectual property, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property. 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products or new technologies that may be competitive with those being developed by us. Therefore, any of our product candidates may give rise to claims that it infringes the patents or proprietary rights of other parties now or in the future. Furthermore, to the extent that we, our consultants, or manufacturing and research collaborators, use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to such intellectual property or in related or resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. A license required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be available to us, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that we are prevented from the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in legal proceedings instituted before patent and trademark offices in the United States, the European Union, or other ex-U.S. territories, or in a suit brought against us by a private party based on such patents or proprietary rights, or in a suit by us asserting our patent or proprietary rights against another party, even if the outcome is not adverse to us. 

Licensing Agreements 

Following are licensing agreements covering technologies and intellectual property rights useful to our HyperAcute product candidates and technologies: 

Central Iowa Health System License Agreement 

We are a party to a license agreement, or the CIHS Agreement, dated August 2, 2001, as amended on December 30, 2013 with the Central Iowa Health System, or CIHS. The CIHS Agreement grants to us an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products that are covered by certain CIHS patent rights, proprietary information or know-how relating to our HyperAcute immunotherapy technology. The license is subject to CIHS's retained right to use, and to permit other academic and research institutions to use, the CIHS patent rights and information for non-commercial bona fide research purposes. The license is also subject to certain rights of and obligations to the United States government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a United States federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under the license, so long as the sublicense is subordinate to, and complies with, the CIHS Agreement. 

In partial consideration of the license under the CIHS Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with CIHS, under which we issued to CIHS shares of our common stock and granted CIHS certain rights related to ownership of such shares. In addition, we must reimburse CIHS for out-of-pocket costs incurred for patent prosecution and maintenance. If we or our sublicensees commercialize a licensed product, we also have the obligation to pay CIHS royalties as a low single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed product, subject to annual minimum royalties and a reduction for any royalty payments we must make to third parties. If we grant a sublicense under the licenses granted by CIHS, we must pay to CIHS, in addition to the royalties described above, a percentage of certain consideration paid by the sublicensee to us. We have no obligation to pay fees to CIHS as a result of payments between us and our affiliates. 

Under the CIHS Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and to launch and market such products in specified markets. As part of such efforts, we must deliver to CIHS certain information including an annual progress report detailing our progress towards commercial use of licensed products. At specific dates after the effective date we must satisfy certain obligations to conduct specified development on the licensed product, expend specified amounts on development of the licensed technology, or raise specific minimum amounts of equity capital. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate appropriate sponsored research programs with researchers at CIHS. If CIHS concludes that we have not met any of these obligations, and we fail to cure such failure, CIHS may either terminate the agreement or convert the license to a non-exclusive license. In addition, if CIHS determines that we have 

failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to, or to grant sublicenses to, develop or commercialize a licensed product in a particular field within the licensed field of use and we fail to cure such failure, CIHS may terminate, or convert the license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such particular field. 

Unless terminated earlier, the CIHS Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations under the agreement. Our royalty obligations expire on a country-by-country and a licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (1) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering a licensed product in a country or (2) 12 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect that the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2023, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. Upon expiration of the CIHS Agreement we will retain a fully-paid, nonexclusive license under the licensed technology to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import licensed products. We may terminate the agreement, or specific patents covered by the agreement, after written notice to CIHS or for CIHS' uncured material breach of the agreement. CIHS has the right to terminate for our uncured material breach of the agreement after written notice. Upon termination of the agreement we may sell our existing inventory of licensed products for a period of three months after such termination. We have the right to assign the CIHS Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets relating to the agreement, but any other assignment requires CIHS' written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

On December 30, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the CIHS Agreement, or the CIHS Amendment. Under the terms of the CIHS Amendment, certain provisions of the CIHS Agreement were amended, in part to clarify that we are not obligated to pay fees to CIHS as a result of payments between us and our affiliates with respect to the intellectual property rights licensed by CIHS to us pursuant to the CIHS Agreement. The CIHS Amendment includes, without limitation, clarifications to (1) the definitions of &#8220;Third Party(ies)&#8221; and &#8220;Net Sales&#8221;, (2) provisions with respect to our obligations to take actions to enable CIHS to meet its obligations under certain federal statutes and (3) provisions with respect to the sublicensing fee payable by us to CIHS. In addition, the CIHS Amendment updates the list of patents that are licensed to us under the CIHS Agreement. We entered into the CIHS Amendment in connection with our sublicensing of certain intellectual property to our wholly owned foreign subsidiary. 

Drexel University License Agreement 

Our license agreement, or the Drexel Agreement, dated October 13, 2004 with Drexel University, or Drexel,will automatically terminate in March 2016 upon the expiration of the last of the Drexel patent rights licensed to us pursuant to the Drexel Agreement. While the Drexel Agreement remains in force, we and our affiliates have an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified Drexel patent rights relating to compositions and methods for vaccines based on alpha-Gal epitopes, to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale vaccine products that are covered by such patent rights, or that use related Drexel technical information, for use in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, viral and other infectious disease. Upon termination of the Drexel Agreement, this license will terminate, and we and our affiliates will not have any right to use the Drexel technical information or to make, have made, use, import, sell or offer for sale products that use the Drexel technical information. 

Following are licensing agreements covering technologies and intellectual property rights useful to our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and product candidate: 

LIMR Exclusive License Agreement (IDO-1) 

We are a party to a license agreement dated July 7, 2005, as amended May 22, 2006 and September 11, 2007, or the IDO-1 Agreement, with Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, or LIMR. The IDO-1 Agreement grants us an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified LIMR patent rights relating to inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, or IDO-1, and related LIMR technology, to make, have made, use, and sell products that are covered by such patent rights for use in the field of animal and human therapeutics and diagnostics. Such license is subject to LIMR's retained right to use such LIMR patent rights and technology for its non-commercial educational and research purposes, and LIMR agrees to notify and provide us with a first look at any additional research findings that directly result from such use of the technology. We may grant sublicenses under the LIMR Licenses, provided that each sublicense materially conforms to the IDO-1 Agreement and is expressly subject to its terms. 

In consideration of such license grant, we are obligated to pay to LIMR specified license fees, annual license maintenance fees, reimbursement of past patent prosecution costs, potential one time milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $1.36 million, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products if a licensed product is commercialized, subject to reduction for our royalty payments to third parties. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the IDO-1 Agreement, we must to pay to LIMR a percentage of the consideration received by us from the sublicensee. 

Under the IDO-1 Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products, and to achieve certain milestones by agreed-upon deadlines. If we breach our obligations and fail to cure such breach, LIMR may reduce our license to a non-exclusive license or revoke the license in its entirety. We have the responsibility, at our expense, to conduct the prosecution and maintenance of the LIMR patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. 

Unless terminated earlier, the IDO-1 Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration of the last licensed LIMR patents. Pending the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2024, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. LIMR may terminate the agreement for our failure to make payments due, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, and we may terminate the agreement upon a specified period of notice. Upon termination of the agreement, we may sell our current inventory of licensed products and those licensed products in the process of manufacture, subject to the terms of the agreement. We have the right to assign the IDO-1 Agreement in connection with an acquisition, merger, consolidation, operation of law or the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets or equity relating to the agreement, but any other assignment requires the express prior written consent of LIMR, not to be unreasonably withheld. 

Augusta University Research Institute License Agreement 

We are a party to a License Agreement dated September 13, 2005, or the AURI Agreement, with Augusta University Research Institute, or AURI, which was formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, the Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. and the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute. The AURI Agreement was amended on March 28, 2006, April 27, 2006, February 13, 2007, July 12, 2013 and July 10, 2014. The AURI Agreement grants us, including our affiliates, an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified AURI patent rights and related technology to make, use, import, sell and offer for sale products that are covered by licensed patent rights or incorporates or uses licensed technology in all medical applications. 

Such license is subject to AURI's retained right to use, and to permit its academic research collaborators to use, such AURI patent rights and technology for research and educational purposes. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under such license, subject to the prior approval of AURI, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

In consideration of such license grant, we are obligated to pay to AURI specified license fees (including issuing shares of our common stock), annual license maintenance fees, reimbursement of patent prosecution costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $2.8 million per licensed product, and royalties as a single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products, subject to minimum royalty payments and royalty rates depending on the type of license product. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the license granted by AURI, we must pay to AURI a percentage of the consideration we receive from the sublicensee. 

Under the agreement, we are obligated to make certain investments toward the further development of licensed products within specified time periods. If we fail to make the required investment, AURI may convert our license in the oncology field to a non-exclusive license. In addition, if we fail to develop the licensed products in a non-cancer field, specifically infectious disease or diagnostics, AURI may convert our license in such field to a non-exclusive license. 

Unless terminated earlier, the AURI Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last licensed AURI patents. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2027, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. AURI may terminate this agreement for our uncured material breach, bankruptcy or similar proceedings. We may terminate this agreement for AURI&#8217;s uncured material breach or upon written notice to AURI. For a period of one year following the termination of the agreement, we may sell our licensed products that are fully manufactured and part of our normal inventory at the date of termination. We have the right to assign the AURI Agreement to our affiliates or in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets relating to the agreement, but any other assignment requires the prior written consent of AURI. 

LIMR Exclusive License Agreement (IDO-2) 

We are a party to a license agreement, or the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, executed December 21, 2007 with LIMR. The LIMR IDO-2 Agreement grants us an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified LIMR patent rights relating to inhibitors of the target Indoleamine 2,3 Dioxygenase-2, or IDO-2, and under related LIMR know-how or technology, to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products and services that are covered by such patent rights, for all uses. Such license is subject to LIMR's retained non-exclusive right to use such LIMR patent rights and technical information for internal non-commercial, educational and research purposes only. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government 

under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under the LIMR IDO-2 license, provided that each sublicense complies with the terms of the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement. 

In consideration of such license grant, we have paid to LIMR an upfront license fee and annual license maintenance fees, and are obligated to pay LIMR annual license maintenance fees, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $1.52 million per licensed product, subject to reductions if milestones also qualify under the IDO-1 Agreement, and, if a licensed product is commercialized, royalties as a low single-digit percentage of &#8220;net sales&#8221; of the licensed product, subject to reduction for our royalty payments to third parties. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the licenses granted by LIMR, we must pay to LIMR a percentage of the consideration paid by the sublicensee to us. The payment provisions of the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement provide that, in the event a product for which we have payment obligations under the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement is also covered by payment obligations under the LIMR IDO-1 Agreement, we will not be obligated to pay both such obligations but rather will pay to LIMR the higher of the amounts owed under the two agreements. 

Under the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and exploit products covered by the license. We have the obligation, at our expense and in our reasonable discretion, to conduct the prosecution and maintenance of the LIMR patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. In addition, LIMR granted us the exclusive option to obtain exclusive, worldwide licenses on commercially reasonable terms to future inventions and discoveries of LIMR related to IDO-2 or inhibitors of IDO-2. 

Concurrently with, and as an obligation under, the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with LIMR, or the CRADA Agreement. Under the CRADA Agreement, we agreed to provide funding to LIMR in support of IDO research for one year and renewable at our option. 

Unless terminated earlier, the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement shall continue until the expiration of the last valid LIMR patent licensed under the agreement. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2027, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. We may terminate the Agreement on written notice to LIMR. LIMR has the right to terminate for our uncured breach, bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Upon termination of the agreement, we may sell our current inventory of licensed products and those licensed products in the process of manufacture, subject to the terms of the agreement. We may assign the LIMR Agreement in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets or equity, or by reason of acquisition, merger, consolidation or operation of law, but any other assignment requires LIMR's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

LIMR Exclusive License Agreement (IDO) 

We are a party to a license agreement, or the LIMR IDO Agreement, dated April 23, 2009 with LIMR. The LIMR IDO Agreement grants us an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified LIMR patent rights relating to IDO inhibitors, and under related LIMR know-how or technology, to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products and services that are covered by such patent rights, for all uses. Such license is subject to LIMR's retained non-exclusive right to use such LIMR patent rights and technical information for internal non-commercial, educational and research purposes only. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under the LIMR IDO license, provided that each sublicense complies with the terms of the LIMR IDO Agreement. 

In consideration of such license grant, we are obligated to pay LIMR potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $610,000 per licensed product, subject to reductions if milestones also qualify under the IDO-1 Agreement or LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of &#8220;net sales&#8221; of the licensed product, subject to reduction for our royalty payments to third parties and to LIMR under the IDO-1 Agreement or LIMR IDO-2 Agreement. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the licenses granted by LIMR, we must pay to LIMR a percentage of the consideration paid by the sublicensee to us. 

Under the LIMR IDO Agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and exploit products covered by the license. We have the right and responsibility, at our expense and in our reasonable discretion, to conduct the prosecution and maintenance of the LIMR patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. 

Unless terminated earlier, the LIMR IDO Agreement shall continue until the expiration of the last valid LIMR patent licensed under the agreement. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2029, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. We may terminate the Agreement on written notice to LIMR. LIMR has the right to terminate for our uncured breach, bankruptcy or similar

Bresagen also has the right to terminate for our uncured breach, repeated breach, or insolvency, change of control without consent or similar proceedings. Upon termination of the agreement, all of our rights under the license are terminated. We may assign the Bresagen Agreement to an affiliate, but any other assignment requires Bresagen's written consent. 

Following are licensing agreements to which BPS is a party covering technologies and intellectual property rights applicable to BPS&#8217;s development of vaccines for the biodefense field: 

The Ohio State University License Agreement 

We are a party to a license agreement dated June 28, 2013 with The Ohio State University, or OSU. This agreement grants us exclusive rights in the United States and its territories, in all fields of use, to patents related to pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines comprising antigens associated with L-Rhamnose and Forssman epitopes, including patent application US 13/463,420, which is co-owned by us and OSU. 

In consideration of the license grant, we are obligated to pay OSU specified license fees and are obligated to pay to OSU specified annual license maintenance fees, patent prosecution and maintenance costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $2.75 million for the first licensed product, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products if a licensed product is commercialized, with minimum royalties for the first three years in which a licensed product generates revenue. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under this agreement, we must also pay to OSU a percentage of certain consideration received by us from the sublicensee. Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products and to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain milestones by agreed-upon deadlines. 

Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will continue until the expiration of the last licensed patent rights which extend until 2024. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any reason with 90 days prior written notice. OSU may immediately terminate the agreement if we materially breach our obligations to OSU and do not cure the breach within the specified period, or if we or our affiliates or sublicensees participates in a challenge to the validity, enforceability or scope of the licensed patents. The agreement will also terminate if we agree with OSU that the agreement should be terminated or if we cease business operations or become involved in any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation-related activities. If the agreement is terminated, we will lose our license from OSU to the licensed patents but we will retain our rights as owners of all licensed patents that are co-owned by us and OSU. 

Public Health Agency of Canada License Agreement 

BPS is a party to a license agreement dated May 4, 2010, with PHAC, or the PHAC License. The PHAC License grants BPS a worldwide, personal, non-transferable, sole, revocable, royalty-bearing license for commercialization of specified Canada patent rights relating to technology based on rVSV. The license is subject to Canada's retained right to use the PHAC patent rights and technology to improve the patent rights, carry out educational purposes, and development of the patent rights where BPS cannot obtain regulatory approval or meet demand. BPS may grant sublicenses under the PHAC License, provided that each sublicense is consistent with the terms and conditions of the PHAC License and contain certain mandatory sublicensing provisions. 

In consideration of the license grant, BPS must pay to Canada specified patent and signing fees, annual license maintenance fees, patent prosecution costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately C$205,000 per licensed product, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of the sales price of the licensed products sold by BPS, which royalty rate varies depending on the type of licensed product. In addition, if BPS grants a sublicense under the licenses granted by Canada, 

BPS is required to pay to Canada a percentage of certain consideration BPS receives from the sublicensee. BPS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products. If BPS breaches its obligations and fails to cure the breach, PHAC may terminate the PHAC License. 

In November 2014, we entered into a licenses and collaboration agreement with Merck to develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The Merck Agreement includes a sublicense of the patents subject to the PHAC License. 

Unless terminated earlier, the PHAC License will remain in effect until the expiration of the last of the PHAC patent rights. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we currently expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2023, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. Canada may terminate this agreement for BPS's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize, failure to pay, breach of confidentiality, cessation of business, criminal conviction or other breach of its obligations under the agreement. BPS may not assign the PHAC License to a third party without the prior written consent of Canada, not to be unreasonably withheld. This agreement will terminate automatically if we assign the PHAC License without prior written consent or if BPS files for bankruptcy or similar proceedings. 

Government Regulation 

We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, among others. 

The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. 

FDA Approval Process 

In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 

Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. We have been informed that one of the approximately 70 clinical trial sites participating in the IMPRESS trial may not be in compliance with certain GCP requirements. The site in question self-reported certain violations to both us and the FDA. The site is conducting an internal investigation, and is implementing a plan to remediate the violations. There can be no assurance that the site will complete such remediation to the satisfaction of the FDA and us, or that the FDA will not ultimately require that some or all of the patients from such site enrolled in the IMPRESS trial be excluded from the final analysis of the study. Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. 

If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Before proceeding with a Phase 3 clinical trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding if new circumstances arise. In addition, even if an SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations. 

In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1B clinical trials. Additionally, when product candidates can do damage to normal cells, it is not ethical to administer such drugs to healthy patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. Submission of an NDA or BLA also requires the payment of a substantial user fee, unless a waiver applies. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within ten months of their acceptance for filing, and for priority designated applications, within six months of their acceptance for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. The FDA may also inspect one or more non-clinical study sites to assurance compliance with GLP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the proposed facility or the facilities at which the drug substance or drug product is manufactured, tested, packaged or labeled. The FDA will not approve the product unless it has compliance with GCP, GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the marketing application (the NDA or, in the case of biologics, the BLA) contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication or indications studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA's general biological product standards to demonstrate that the product is safe, pure and potent. 

After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an Approval Letter, or a Complete Response letter. A Complete Response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been 

addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an Approval Letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a Complete Response letter because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. 

An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indication or indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

Fast Track Designation 

A Fast Track product is a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. Under the FDA's Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request that the FDA designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product, prior to a new drug or biologic license application submission. Fast Track designation enables a company to file their application for approval on a rolling basis and potentially qualify for priority review. 

The FDA may condition approval of an application for a Fast Track product for accelerated approval on a commitment to do post-approval studies to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint and require prior review of all promotional materials. In addition, the FDA may withdraw approval of a Fast Track product in an expedited manner on a number of grounds, including the sponsor's failure to conduct any required post-approval study in a timely manner. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

The FDA grants Orphan Drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which for this program is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. 

Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process for an orphan drug, nor does it give that drug any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives the first approval for the indication for which it has designation, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the United States. Orphan Drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA determines that our request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantity of our drug. 

Additional benefits of Orphan Drug designation include clinical tax research incentives and exemption from application filing fees. Although obtaining approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may be advantageous, we cannot be certain: 

&#8226; 

that we will be the first to obtain approval for any other drugs or indications for which we obtain Orphan Drug designation; 

&#8226; 

that Orphan Drug designation will result in any commercial advantage or reduce competition; or 

&#8226; 

that the limited exceptions to this exclusivity will not be invoked by the FDA. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act 

In seeking approval for marketing of a drug or biologic through an NDA or BLA, respectively, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or FDA approved method of using this product. Upon approval of a product, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA applicant and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA applicant and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug. 

Ongoing Regulatory Requirements 

Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. 

Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indication or indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, or in the case of biologics, a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all. 

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced, routine or for-cause inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 

Federal and State Healthcare Laws 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to increase the transparency of and restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws include the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. 

Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, are also applicable to our business. We could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. There are also state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Regulation Outside the United States 

Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain approval in the United States, we will be subject to separate regulatory approval standards in foreign countries. In the E.U., for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the E.U. (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the E.U. can be used to obtain approval in another country of the E.U. under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After regulatory approval is received through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. 

Similar to the United States, a system for Orphan Drug designation exists in the E.U. Orphan designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process for an orphan drug, nor does it give that drug any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for ten years in the E.U. 

Price Controls 

In many of the markets where we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, the Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS and pursuant to CMS's subregulatory coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict how CMS may apply those regulations and subregulatory determinations to newly approved products, especially novel products, and those regulations and interpretive determinations are subject to change. Moreover, the methodology under which CMS makes coverage and reimbursement determinations is subject to change, particularly because of budgetary pressures facing the Medicare program. Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services. 

In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 

Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that are expected to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 we had approximately 210 employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Facilities 

Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in the Iowa State University Research Park in Ames, Iowa. In June 2010, we completed the expansion of approximately 23,500 square foot facility, which includes executive offices as well as approximately 14,000 feet dedicated to manufacturing, testing and product storage. The manufacturing portion of the facility became operational on October 17, 2010. The lease expires January 31, 2020, and we have the option to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods upon the same terms as the base lease. In addition, we continue to occupy a small pilot manufacturing and office facility in the same research park under the terms of a lease that expires October 31, 2016. 

On November 14, 2011, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, or the Memorandum, with Iowa State University Research Park Corporation, or ISURP. The Memorandum is an addendum to the lease, or the Lease, dated September 30, 2009 between us and ISURP covering our facilities in Ames, Iowa. The Memorandum added approximately 26,600 square feet of additional space to the Lease. During 2012 operating rents to ISURP increased by $211,000. During 2012, ISURP provided a building allowance of $622,000 and assisted in securing an additional $456,000 in debt financing for us. This lease expires on February 28, 2017. 

On December 29, 2014, we added an additional 6,770 square feet of offices located in the Iowa State University Research Park in Ames, Iowa. On July 9, 2015 we added 2,070 square feet of offices adjacent to the 6,770 square feet. Both leases expire January 31, 2018. 

On February 24, 2014, we signed a lease for a 6,430 square foot commercial facility and additional executive offices in Austin, Texas and amended the lease in February 2015. We anticipate conducting activities at this location associated with expansion of our commercialization efforts as well as supporting the continued growth of our clinical operations activities. On February 16, 2015, we added an additional 3,468 square feet to the Austin facility. The lease expires September 30, 2016. 

On August 25, 2014, we entered into a lease for 47,250 square feet of space in Ankeny, Iowa where we plan to manage the final production steps, including irradiation and packaging, and to distribute our potential vaccine drug products, if any are approved. The lease expires October 31, 2017. 

On December 15, 2014, we entered into a lease for 1,310 square feet of office space in Devens, Massachusetts to support our development efforts related to our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The lease expired December 14, 2015 and we are in discussions to renegotiate the terms of the renewal.
