 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

As used in this Annual Report, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Broadwind&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Broadwind Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Cicero, Illinois, and its wholly &#8209;owned subsidiaries (the &#8220;Subsidiaries&#8221;). Dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated. 

Business Overview 

We provide technologically advanced high &#8209;value products to energy, mining and infrastructure sector customers, primarily in the United States of America (the &#8220;U.S.&#8221;). Our most significant presence is within the U.S. wind energy industry, although we have diversified into other industrial markets in order to improve our capacity utilization and reduce our exposure to uncertainty related to favorable governmental policies currently supporting the U.S. wind energy industry. The recent multi-year extension of the federal Production Tax Credit (the &#8220;PTC&#8221;) for new wind energy development projects is expected to help stabilize wind energy markets. Within the U.S. wind energy industry, we provide products primarily to wind turbine manufacturers. Outside of the wind energy market, we provide precision gearing and specialty weldments to a broad range of industrial customers for oil and gas (&#8220;O&#38;G&#8221;), mining, steel and other industrial applications. The market for O&#38;G equipment and mining equipment was extremely weak in 2015 and is not expected to recover in the near term. 

In September 2015, our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved a plan to divest or otherwise exit our Services segment. The divestiture was substantially completed in December 2015; consequently, this segment is now reported as a discontinued operation and we have revised our segment presentation to include two reportable operating segments: Towers and Weldments, and Gearing. All current and prior period financial results have been revised to reflect these changes. 

&#160;

In 2015, 84% of our sales were linked to new wind energy installations, predominantly for towers used for new wind turbines. The market for new U.S. wind energy installations is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) economic growth and the associated demand for new electricity generation; (ii) the cost of competing energy sources, primarily natural gas; (iii) federal and state &#8209;level wind energy development incentives; (iv) available transmission infrastructure and the proliferation of smart grid technology; (v) improvements in wind energy cost competitiveness resulting from the maturation of technologies and services within the wind energy industry; and (vi) state and federal government actions relating to regulation of carbon emissions. 

The highest impact development incentive has been the PTC for new wind energy projects. Legislative support for the PTC has been intermittent in the past, which has caused volatility in the demand for new wind energy projects. For example, after the PTC was allowed to expire briefly in 2013, new installations at wind farms fell 92%, causing significant disruption in the industry. In December 2015, the PTC was extended for an additional five-year period, which is expected to help stabilize wind energy markets and attract new investment. The 2015 extension phases-out the amount of the credit allowed over time based on the year when construction of the wind project is started. The phase-out schedule provides for: 100% extension of the credit for projects commenced in 2015 and 2016, 80% in 2017, 60% in 2018 and 40% in 2019. Although the clearer investment horizon provided by the long-term extension is expected to stabilize the market for our products, it may also attract new competition in our industry. The new PTC extension also provides a longer time period to begin construction of qualifying wind projects than the previous legislation, which has caused some short-term delay in the commencement of wind farm development projects. 

The market for wind towers is broadly correlated to the demand for new wind turbines. However, demand for our products is also reflective of the level of market competition, the strength of our customer relationships and the proximity of our plants to wind farm development sites, as well as other factors. During 2015, sales of our wind towers were strong because of a number of factors: several domestic competitors exited the market in 2012, the 2013 PTC extension was in place to support new wind energy installations, foreign competition from China and Vietnam was limited by U.S. Department of Commerce (&#8220;USDOC&#8221;) antidumping and countervailing duty orders, and we continued working with large customers representing a significant portion of the U.S. market. 

Outside of the market for new wind energy installations, we serve a number of other industrial markets, including O&#38;G exploration and extraction, mining, compressed natural gas (&#8220;CNG&#8221;) distribution and steel production, as well as gearing for the installed wind energy base. The market for O&#38;G equipment and mining equipment was extremely weak in 2015 and is not expected to recover in the near-term. We have reduced our workforce and other costs, and are selling excess gear cutting and grinding equipment in order to further scale back production capacity and costs in response to these depressed market conditions. Our products sold into these markets include gearboxes (both new and rebuilt), loose gearing and large industrial weldments, including CNG equipment. The following table details the percentage of our revenue generated in each sector for the past two years:

Business and Operating Strategy 

We intend to capitalize on the markets in wind energy, O&#38;G, mining, CNG distribution and other industrial verticals in North America by leveraging our core competencies in large precision gearing and drivetrains and industrial welding. Our strategic objectives include the following: 

&#183; 

Improve our commercial efforts and expand and diversify our customer base. In 2015, sales derived from our top five customers represented 92 % of total sales , up from 91% in 2014. To reduce the concentration of sales and our wind energy industry concentration, we have focused our market research activities and our sales force in support of expanding and diversifying our customer base. We began producing CNG equipment for several customers in 2015 and plan to expand our presence in this market in 2016. 

&#183; 

Improve capacity utilization and profitability. We are working to improve our capacity utilization and financial results by leveraging our existing manufacturing capacity and adjusting capacity where we can, in 

&#160;

response to changing market conditions. Tower and gear manufacturing and drivetrain remanufacturing all require significant capital investments. As a result of significant capital expenditures made in 2008 and 2009, we have manufacturing capacity available that may allow us to significantly increase our annual revenues. We seek to broaden our wind tower customer base, and in January 2016, we booked an order with a wind tower customer for whom we last produced towers in 2013. We still have unsold 2016 capacity in our wind tower operations, and believe that the recent PTC extension will facilitate improved utilization. In our Gearing segment, we have reduced our workforce and are selling excess gear cutting and grinding equipment in order to further scale back production capacity and costs in response to the depressed market conditions. 

&#183; 

Improve production technology and operational efficiency. We believe that the proper coordination and integration of the supply chain plus &#8220;Continuous Improvement&#8221; initiatives are key factors that enable high operating efficiencies, increased reliability, better delivery and lower costs. As customer specifications have become increasingly stringent, the supply chain has globalized and the tower industry has matured, we have experienced difficulties maintaining consistent output in our manufacturing facilities. We are developing better supply chain expertise, working with lean enterprise resources, upgrading and improving systems utilization and investing capital to help enhance our operational efficiency and flexibility. These investments are expected to correct the significant operating problems and reduce or eliminate the associated costs we experienced in 2015. We have staffed our operations with Continuous Improvement experts in order to optimize our production processes to increase output, leverage our scale and lower our costs while maintaining product quality. 

Restructuring Activities 

In 2011, we concluded that our manufacturing footprint and fixed cost base were too large and expensive for our medium term needs. We executed a plan to reduce our facility footprint by approximately 40% through the sale and/or closure of facilities comprising a total of approximately 600,000 square feet. Of the $14,200 total restructuring costs incurred, approximately $4,800 were non-cash charges. 

As a result of recent weakness in some of our markets as described above and in addition to discontinuing our Services segment, we took a number of cost reduction actions in 2015. These actions included idling two facilities, reducing headcount and eliminating positions totaling approximately 10% of our workforce. We have also consolidated our industrial weldment production into our Abilene, Texas facility, and have reduced capital and discretionary spending in all areas to conserve cash. We continue to monitor these markets and our spending. 

COMPANY HISTORY 

We were incorporated in 1996 in Nevada as Blackfoot Enterprises, Inc., and through a series of subsequent transactions, became Broadwind Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in 2008. Through several acquisitions in 2007 and 2008, we focused on expanding upon our core platform as a wind tower component manufacturer, established our Gearing segment, and developed our industrial weldment capabilities. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

We market our towers, gearing and industrial weldments products primarily through our direct sales force (supplemented with independent sales agents in our Gearing segment). Our sales and marketing strategy is to develop and maintain long &#8209;term relationships with our energy and infrastructure sector customers. Within the wind energy industry, our customer base consists primarily of wind turbine manufacturers who supply end &#8209;users and wind farm operators with wind turbines. Within the O&#38;G and mining industries, our customer base consists of manufacturers of hydraulic fracturing and mud pumps, mining equipment, CNG equipment and off &#8209;highway vehicles. To support the efforts of our sales force, we utilize a number of marketing tactics to build our brand and position and promote our products. Our efforts include participation in industry conferences, media relations, use of social media and other channels and use of our website to connect with customers. 

COMPETITION 

Each of our businesses faces competition from both domestic and international companies. The recent extension of the PTC may attract additional investment and competition in the wind energy industry. The industrial gearing industry has experienced consolidation of producers and acquisitions by strategic buyers in response to strong international competition and reduced O&#38;G and mining demand. 

&#160;

For our Towers and Weldments segment, the largest North American based competitor is Trinity Industries. Other competitors include Vestas Wind Systems, which has periodically produced towers for third party customers in addition to meeting its own captive tower requirements, and Marmen Industries, a Canadian manufacturer that has recently expanded into the U.S. market. We also face competition from imported towers, primarily from Asian manufacturers. However, imports from China and Vietnam have substantially ceased following a determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission in 2013 that wind towers from those countries were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. As a result of the determination, the USDOC issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of wind towers from China and an antidumping duty order on imports of towers from Vietnam. We continue to monitor wind tower imports. 

In our Gearing segment, which is focused on the O&#38;G, wind energy, mining and steel markets, our key competitors in a fragmented market include Overton Chicago Gear, Cincinnati Gearing Systems, Merit Gear, Milwaukee Gear and Horsburgh &#38; Scott. In addition, we compete with the internal gear manufacturing capacity of relevant equipment manufacturers and face growing competition from foreign competitors. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although it is our objective to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, it may not be possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. Several of our facilities have a history of industrial operations, and contaminants have been detected at some of our facilities. 

BACKLOG 

We sell our towers under either supply agreements or individual purchase orders, depending on the size and duration of the purchase commitment. Under the supply agreements, we typically receive a purchase commitment for towers to be delivered in future fiscal quarters, then receive purchase orders on a periodic basis based upon the customer&#8217;s forecast of production volume requirements within the contract terms. For our Gearing segment, sales are generally based on individual purchase orders. As of December 31, 2015, the dollar amount of our backlog believed to be firm under our supply agreements and purchas e orders awarded was approximately $94 million. This represents a 53% decrease from the backlog at December 31, 2014, which reflected a surge in tower orders related to a tight supply market and the timing of the PTC renewal and a decline in O&#38;G and mining industry demand for gearing and weldments. 

SEASONALITY 

The majority of our business is not affected by seasonality. 

EMPLOYEES 

We had 680 employees at December 31, 2015, of which 619 were in manufacturing related functions and 61 were in administrative functions. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 14% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with local unions in our Cicero, Illinois and Neville Island, Pennsylvania locations. The current collective bargaining agreement with the Cicero union is expected to remain in effect through February 2018. The current collective bargaining agreement with the Neville Island union is expected to remain in effect through October 2017. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally good. 

RAW MATERIALS 

The primary raw material used in the construction of wind towers and gearing products is steel in the form of plate, bar stock, forgings or castings. The market for tower steel has become increasingly globalized. Although we are generally responsible for procurement of the raw materials, our global tower customers often negotiate the prices and terms for steel purchases, and we purchase under these agreements. We then pass the steel cost through to our end customer plus a conversion margin. 

Outside of these &#8220;directed buys&#8221;, we operate a multiple supplier sourcing strategy and source our raw materials through various suppliers located throughout the U.S. and abroad. We generally do not have long &#8209;term supply agreements with our raw materials suppliers and closely match terms with those of our customers to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of steel and other raw materials to meet our manufacturing requirements, although from time to time we have faced shortages of specific grades of steel. Additionally, due to the globalization of the supply chain for tower steel prompted by the increasing use of &#8220;directed buys&#8221;, we faced 

&#160;

supply disruptions during 2015 associated with the West Coast port labor slowdowns. Such shortages have periodically limited our ability to meet customer demand and caused manufacturing inefficiencies. We have made modifications to our supply chain management practices to deal more effectively with disruptions arising from the practice of &#8220;directed buys&#8221;. 

QUALITY CONTROL 

We have a long &#8209;standing focus on processes for ensuring the manufacture of high &#8209;quality products. To achieve high standards of production and operational quality, we implement strict and extensive quality control and inspections throughout our production processes. We maintain internal quality controls over all core manufacturing processes and carry out quality assurance inspections at the completion of each major manufacturing step to ensure the quality of our products. The manufacturing process at our Gearing operation, for example, involves transforming forged steel into precision gears through cutting, heat treating, testing and finishing. We inspect and test raw materials before they enter the assembly process, re &#8209;test the raw materials after rough machining, test the functioning of gear teeth and cores after thermal treatment and accuracy test final outputs for compliance with product specifications. We believe our investment in industry &#8209;leading heat treatment, high precision machining, specialized grinding technologies and cutting &#8209;edge welding has contributed to our high product reliability and the consistent performance of our products under varying operating conditions. Our Gearing segment is ISO 9001:2008 certified. Our tower manufacturing plants in Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Abilene, Texas are ISO 9001:2010 certified. Our Abilene tower plant experienced operating inefficiencies, high labor costs and inventory adjustments in 2015 related to difficulties experienced in meeting the quality specifications associated with one significant tower order. We are making changes to our operating practices and our capital base to minimize future production disruptions. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for further discussion of the effects of the deficiencies. 

CUSTOMERS 

We manufacture products for a variety of customers in the wind energy, O&#38;G, mining and other infrastructure industries. The majority of our wind energy industry customer base consists of wind turbine manufacturers who supply wind farm operators and wind farm developers with completed wind turbines. In the other industrial sectors, we sell our products through our trained sales force or through manufacturers&#8217; representatives to a wide variety of customers. The wind turbine market is very concentrated. According to American Wind Energy Association 2015 industry data, the top three wind turbine manufacturers constituted approximately 88% of the U.S. market. As a result, although we have historically produced towers for most of these global wind turbine manufacturers, in any given year a limited number of customers have accounted for the majority of our revenues. Sales to each of Siemens and General Electric represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The loss of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result, we are seeking to diversify our customer base. 

WORKING CAPITAL 

Our primary customers are wind turbine manufacturers and wind farm operators. The industry has historically entered into customized contracts with varying terms and conditions between suppliers and customers, depending on the specific objectives of each party. As such, we produce to order rather than to stock. Our practices mirror this historical industry practice of negotiating agreements on a case &#8209;by &#8209;case basis. As a result, working capital needs, including levels of accounts receivable (&#8220;A/R&#8221;), customer deposits and inventory, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the contractual terms associated with each quarter&#8217;s sales, such as whether and when we are required to purchase and supply steel pursuant to such contractual terms. 

In analyzing our liquidity, we focus on operating working capital in relationship to revenue. Operating working capital is comprised of A/R and inventories, net of accounts payable (&#8220;A/P&#8221;) and customer deposits. Our operating working capital at December 31, 2015 was $10,241 or 7% of trailing three months of sales annualized. This is an increase of $1,998 from December 31, 2014, when operating working capital was $8,243, or 4% of trailing three months of sales annualized. The increase reflects reduced levels of A/P due in part to a shift in steel suppliers.
