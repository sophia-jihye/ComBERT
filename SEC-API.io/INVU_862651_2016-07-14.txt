Recent Developments 

&#160;

On December 2, 2014, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the &#34;Purchase Agreement&#34;) with CertusHoldings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire CertusSecurities, Inc., a Georgia Corporation (&#8220;CSI&#8221;), and CertusInvestment Advisers, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (&#8220;CIA&#8221;). The aggregate purchase price was $190,000 plus 1,600,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for the option to acquire from third party. On March 13, 2015, in connection with the sale of GGI, Inc., 1,350,000 previously issued common shares for the right to acquire CertusHoldings, Inc. were returned and cancelled. The fair value of the net common shares issued of $512,500 (250,000) was charged to current period operations as indirect acquisition costs. The closing is subject to board and regulatory approval.

&#160; 

In June of 2015, we informed the Financial Regulatory Authority, (FINRA), that we would withdraw our application requesting change in ownership of Certus Securities and certain other CSI assets.

&#160;

After continued due diligence, we discovered that CSI was closing key branch office locations and its designated financial planning offices. These closures drastically diminished the value of the asset being purchased and the integrity of the business plan. Subsequently, we were unable to secure financing to meet the capital requirements for Broker Dealer organizations as required by FINRA. Upon withdrawal from FINRA, we terminated a Letter of Intent that had been entered into between the parties and withdrew from the Purchase Agreement effectively terminating our pending purchase of the CSI assets.

&#160;

our LOI and withdrew from the purchase agreement terminating our pending purchase of CSI assets.

&#160;

In August 2014, the Company formed Vickrey Brown Investments, LLC, a limited liability company under the laws of California with 51% membership interests specializing in investment strategies which combine quantitative strategies, forensic accounting and volatility controls. At formation, the minority members paid an aggregate of $1,000 as equity in their collective contribution. The Company contributed $120,000 as its equity contribution and is contingently obligated to issue 500,000 shares of common stock upon achieving certain milestones (as defined). Prior to all distributions, the Company is to receive 25% of all revenue generated until at which time the $120,000 equity contribution of the Company has been paid.

&#160;

On December 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement whereby the Company surrendered its equity ownership in Vickrey Brown Investments LLC and transferred ownership of SAFE Management LLC (&#8220;Safe&#8221;) in exchange for 25% of all revenue generated by Vickrey Brown Investments, LLC until an aggregate of $120,000 has been paid and 30.6% of remaining and future revenue.

&#160;

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Investment Tools &#38; Training, LLC (&#34;ITT&#34;) and Razor Data Corp (&#34;Razor&#34;). All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The Company faces competition for subscribers from all forms of financial news and information sources, including print publications, television and radio, and other internet information services providers. The financial services sector is diverse, growing and characterized by rapid change where there are no dominant players. Competitors in this sector have unique attributes and a dominant player has yet to emerge. Despite rapid expansion, the broad sector penetration is still relatively in the early stages, competitors offer different products and services and success is characterized by speed to market and uniqueness of its offering. There are a multitude of providers for online financial information, each using their own analysis methods and research tools. Our competitors include Edgar Online, BankRate.com, TheStreet.com and Morningstar. In addition, the major on-line brokerages provide a similar service to their best clients free of charge. The large on-line brokers have acquired similar companies and those companies now are associated with firms that have far greater resources. Competition may result in price reductions, decreased gross margins and loss of market share. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. Although the internet is ubiquitous, we believe we primarily serve clients in North America. We also do not provide our services other than in English.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and know-how. To a great degree it also depends on our ability to broadly market our products to our potential customers, gain their acceptance of those products and then renewed subscription of those products. The Company owns, through its acquisitions of Investment Tools &#38; Training and Razor Data (1) all the financial education products and education and teaching modules in both on-line and physical forms which it markets, sells and delivers through its businesses, (2) all technical tools, presentations, charts, analyses, strategies, customer teaching and support methodologies, subscription services delivery content and systems, and (3) all marketing know-how, product names and brands, logos, names descriptors, url&#8217;s and private labeling capability.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We have positioned the Company as a knowledge provider and educator, which seeks to augment a user&#8217;s informed decision-making process, rather than act as a conductor of investment decisions or a representative of investment services. As such, our activities do not fall within the scope of securities industry regulation. We do not provide securities brokerage or investment advisory services. Our products and services also do not require that any representative distributing the services of Investview conduct themselves as an investment advisor or broker. We in fact encourage all representatives and users of our information services to seek unrelated investment professionals for securities related activities.

&#160;

We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to government regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations adopted at the local, state, national and international levels and taxes levied at the state level. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, enforcement of existing laws, such as consumer protection regulations, in connection with Web-based activities has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could inhibit the growth in use of the Internet and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, which could in turn decrease the demand for our services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
