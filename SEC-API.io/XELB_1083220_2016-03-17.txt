 Item 1. Business &#160;

Overview of the Business 

&#160;

Xcel Brands, Inc. (&#8220;Xcel,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a brand development and media company engaged in the design, production, licensing, marketing, and direct to consumer sales of branded apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home goods, and other consumer products, and the acquisition of dynamic consumer lifestyle brands. Presently, our brand portfolio consists of the Isaac Mizrahi, Judith Ripka, H Halston, C Wonder, and Highline Collective brands. We also manage and design the Liz Claiborne New York brand (&#8220;LCNY Brand&#8221;) through July 31, 2016. Going forward, our focus shall be on our wholly owned brands.

&#160;

Our objective is to build a diversified portfolio of lifestyle consumer brands through organic growth and the strategic acquisition of new brands. To achieve growth under our brands, we are focused on two primary licensing and design activities:

&#183; licensing our brands for distribution through direct-response television (i.e. QVC and The Shopping Channel); and &#183; licensing our brands to manufacturers and retailers for promotion and distribution through e-commerce, social commerce, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. &#160;

We believe that Xcel offers a unique value proposition to its licensors and customers for the following reasons:

&#183; our management team, including our officers&#8217; and directors&#8217; historical track records and relationships within the industry; &#183; our brand management platform, which has a strong focus on design, production, marketing, and social media; and &#183; our operating strategy of licensing brands with significant media presence and driving sales through our omni-channel retail sales strategy across direct-response television, internet and traditional retail channels. &#160;

We license our brands to third parties, provide certain design, production, and marketing services, and generate royalty design and service fee revenues through licensing and other agreements with manufacturers and retailers. This includes licensing our own brands for promotion and distribution through an omni-channel retail sales strategy, which includes distribution through direct-response television, the internet, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. We believe that this strategy distinguishes us from other brand management companies that rely primarily on their licensees for design, production and distribution, and enables us to leverage the media reach of our direct-response television partners, including through television, digital and social media, to drive sales of products under our brands across distribution channels.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our vision is intended to reimagine shopping, entertainment, and social as one. By leveraging digital and social media content across all distribution channels, we seek to drive customer (follower) engagement and generate retail sales across our brands. Our strong relationships with leading retailers and direct-response television companies, such as QVC and The Shopping Channel, enable us to reach consumers in over 350 million homes worldwide.

&#160;

We believe our &#8220;virtual vertical&#8221; business model provides significant competitive advantages compared with traditional wholesale apparel companies that design, manufacture, and distribute products. We remain focused on our core competencies of licensing, production, design, marketing and brand development, while outsourcing manufacturing and the related inventory ownership to best-in-class partners. We believe our platform is highly scalable due to our business model&#8217;s low overhead and working capital requirements, coupled with minimum guaranteed income levels through our multi-year licensing contracts. Additionally, we believe we can quickly integrate additional brands into our platform in order to leverage our design, production oversight, and marketing capabilities and retail and licensee relationships.

&#160;

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Our vision is intended to reimagine shopping, entertainment, and social as one. To fulfill this vision, we plan to continue to grow the reach of our brand portfolio by leveraging our own internal design, production and marketing expertise and our relationships with key licensees and retailers, and to market our brands through our innovative omni-channel retail sales strategy. Our omni-channel strategy includes distribution through direct-response television, the internet, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. By leveraging the reach and media presence of our direct-response television partners, such as QVC, and by developing rich online video and social media content under our brands, our strategy is to drive increased customer engagement and generate sales across our channels of distribution. Key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#8226; Expand Wholesale License Relationships . Since acquiring the Mizrahi brands in September 2011, we have entered into numerous license agreements for various product categories. We intend to enter into additional license agreements for new product categories for our existing brands, and any other brands we may acquire. &#160;

&#8226; Expand Brand and Retail Partnerships. We have entered into promotional collaborations and/or marketing agreements with large global companies such as General Motors, Johnson &#38; Johnson, and Kleenex and have developed exclusive programs through certain licensees for specialty retailers such as Best Buy and Michaels. We plan to continue to develop strategic relationships under our brands that can leverage our media reach through direct-response television and social media to drive traffic and sales for our brands and retail partners and enhance the visibility of our brands. &#160;

&#8226; Expand Internationally . In 2014, we launched the Ripka brands on The Shopping Channel in Canada, and brought the Mizrahi brand to the United Kingdom through QVC. In 2015, we expanded the Mizrahi brand into Italy, France, and Germany on QVC; began selling the Ripka brands through QVC in Germany and Japan; and launched the H by Halston brand on QVC in the United Kingdom. We plan to continue to expand our brands internationally through QVC and to license to certain international licensing partners the right to distribute products under our brands through department stores and other retailers in such international markets. &#160;

&#8226; Deliver Quality Product Offerings . We employ a design team to provide design and other services to our licensees to ensure that our products adhere to stringent quality standards and design specifications that we have developed. We intend to continue to invest in our design and marketing capabilities in order to differentiate our services to our licensees and our brands in the marketplace. &#160;

&#8226; Deliver Short Lead-Time Production Capabilities through a QTR Platform . In 2015 we developed a quick-time response (QTR) production platform in order to be able to deliver short lead-time production capabilities of between four to eight weeks to our licensed retail partners, which currently include Lord &#38; Taylor and The Bay. Given some of the challenges facing the department store industry today, including declining customer traffic, aggressive mark-down cadence and inability to respond quickly to customer demands, we developed this QTR platform with the help of the former CPO of one of the leading global fast fashion retailers in order to be able to deliver a full 360-degree solution to our licensees including design, marketing, and production and sourcing advice and to try to address some of these challenges. We provide the platform to our licensees and in certain cases manage the supply chain on their behalf; however, the licensees are responsible for purchasing products directly from the factories. In connection with developing the QTR platform, we have hired experienced production experts and personnel to set up and manage the platform. While we continue to evolve and develop the QTR platform, we intend to leverage the platform across additional brands and/or retailers, and believe that it provides us with a value-added service that differentiates us from our peers. 

&#160;

&#8226; Acquire or Partner with Strategic Brands . We plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of additional brands or the rights to brands which we believe are synergistic and complementary to our overall strategy. Our brand acquisition strategy is focused on dynamic brands that we believe: &#160;

&#160; &#8226; are synergistic to our existing portfolio of brands; &#160; &#8226; are leverageable onto our proprietary product development and brand management platform; &#160; &#8226; exhibit meaningful organic growth potential; and &#160; &#8226; are expected to be accretive to our earnings. &#160;

From time to time we enter into letters of intent or offer letters with respect to the acquisitions of additional brands. There can be no assurance that we will complete any brand acquisition under a letter of intent on favorable terms or at all.

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Licensors are typically brand owners who invest and manage their intellectual property, but leave much of the expense and operational heavy lifting, such as sourcing and distribution, to third party licensees. Licensors maintain control over their brand image while extracting a percentage royalty from licensees in exchange for the use of the trademark in strategically segmented categories and channels. This strategy minimizes operational risk while generating healthy margins and free cash flow relative to traditional wholesale apparel companies.

&#160;

Brand management and licensing is a large and rapidly-growing global industry that in 2014 generated over $241 billion in retail sales and $13.4 billion in royalty revenues worldwide, according to the 2015 Annual Licensing Industry Survey by the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers&#8217; Association (&#8220;LIMA&#8221;). The United States and Canada, which is where the Company primarily operates, was reported by LIMA to be the most dominant region in the brand management and licensing industry, with more than $144 billion in retail sales, nearly 60% of the worldwide total. LIMA indicated that fashion was one of the top three largest categories or sectors in licensing, representing $29 billion in estimated retail sales or 12% of the worldwide total in 2014, and $16.9 billion in estimated retail sales or 12% of the United States and Canada.

&#160; 

Design, Production, Marketing and Licensing Business 

&#160;

We license our brands to third parties, provide certain design, production and marketing services, in certain cases provide production advisory services and oversight, and generate royalty design and service fee revenues through licensing and other agreements with wholesale manufacturers, sourcing and design companies, and retailers. This includes licensing our own brands for promotion and distribution through an omni-channel retail sales strategy, which includes distribution through direct-response television, the internet, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. We believe that this strategy distinguishes us from other brand management companies that rely primarily on their licensees for design and distribution and enables us to leverage the media reach of our direct-response television partners, including through television and social media, to drive sales of products under our brands across distribution channels.

&#160;

QVC is an important strategic partner in our design, marketing and licensing business, and is our largest licensee for each of our Mizrahi, Ripka, H Halston, C Wonder, and LCNY brands. QVC&#8217;s business model is to promote and sell products through its direct-response television programs and related internet and mobile platforms. We leverage both our brand celebrity hosts as well as alternate brand hosts to promote products under our brands on QVC. According to QVC, QVC had global revenues of approximately $8.7 billion in 2015. QVC&#8217;s majority stockholder acquired the e-commerce platform Zulilly in 2015, which generated $1.2 billion of retail sales in 2014 according to QVC. Additionally, according to QVC, QVC&#8217;s customer engagement and reach increased to approximately 350 million homes worldwide in 2015, which helped QVC grow its e-commerce sales to $3.1 billion (approximately half of which QVC shows come from mobile, causing it to be the number three mobile multi-category retailer in Internet Retailer Mobile 500 (August 2014)). Also according to QVC, QVC was tied for second in the ForeSee Experience Index and QVC/Liberty Interactive was ranked sixth in the 2014 Internet Retailer eCommerce Top 500. Additionally, our agreements with QVC allow our brand celebrity hosts and spokespersons to promote our non-QVC product lines and strategic partnerships under the Mizrahi, Ripka, H Halston, and C Wonder brands through QVC&#8217;s programs, subject to certain parameters including the payment of a portion of our non-QVC revenues to QVC. We believe that our ability to continue to leverage QVC&#8217;s media platform, reach, and attractive customer base to cross-promote products in and drive traffic to our other channels of distribution provides us a unique advantage.

&#160;

In our licensing agreements, our licensing partners are responsible for manufacturing, selling, and distributing our licensed products, subject to our oversight and marketing support. Our business model allows us to focus on our core competencies of designing, marketing and managing brands without much of the risk and investment requirements associated with traditional apparel companies. The Mizrahi brands and the LCNY brand are licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, IM Brands, LLC or IM Brands, the Ripka brands are licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, JR Licensing, LLC or JR Licensing, the H Halston brands are licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, H Licensing, LLC or H Licensing, and the C Wonder brands are licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, C Wonder Licensing, LLC or CW Licensing.

&#160;

In connection with the aforementioned licensing activities, we provide design support and in certain cases production oversight support to third party licensees for our brands where required and coordinate merchandising and sales efforts for those parties in each case where appropriate. We also conduct marketing, advertising, public relations, and social media marketing campaigns for our brands, and coordinate such activities with our licensees.

&#160;

In 2013, we began offering the Mizrahi brands through direct-response television on The Shopping Channel (TSC) in Canada. In 2014, we launched the Ripka brands on TSC in Canada, and launched the IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand on QVC in the United Kingdom. In 2015, we commenced sales through QVC of our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand in Italy, France, and Germany; the Ripka brands in Germany and Japan; and the H by Halston brand in the United Kingdom. In 2016, we are scheduled to launch the C Wonder brand on QVC both domestically as well as internationally in the United Kingdom, Italy, and France, and expand the H Halston QVC sales to Italy and Germany. We plan to continue to expand our brands internationally through QVC, and through other direct-response television networks where QVC grants us the right to do so. We also plan to license to certain international licensing partners the right to distribute products under our brands through department stores and other retailers and/or the right to open and operate retail stores under our brands in such international markets.

&#160;

&#160; 

QVC Agreements 

&#160;

Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we have entered into direct-to-retail license agreements with QVC, pursuant to which we design, and QVC sources and sells, various products under our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand, the Judith Ripka brands, the H by Halston brand, and the C Wonder brand. These agreements include, respectively, the IM QVC Agreement, the Ripka QVC Agreement, the H QVC Agreement, and the C Wonder QVC Agreement (collectively, the &#8220;QVC Agreements&#8221;). QVC owns the rights to all designs produced under the QVC Agreements, and the QVC Agreements include the sale of products across various categories through QVC&#8217;s television media and related internet sites.

&#160;

Pursuant to the agreements, we have granted to QVC and its affiliates the exclusive, worldwide right to promote our branded products, and the right to use and publish the related trademarks, service marks, copyrights, designs, logos, and other intellectual property rights owned, used, licensed and/or developed by us, for varying terms as set forth below. The Agreements include automatic renewal periods as detailed below unless terminated by either party.

&#160;

In connection with the forgoing and during the same periods, QVC and its subsidiaries have the exclusive, worldwide right to use the names, likenesses, images, voices, and performances of our spokespersons to promote the respective products. Under the IM QVC Agreement, IM Brands has also granted to QVC and its affiliates, during the same period, exclusive, worldwide rights to promote third party vendor co-branded products that, in addition to bearing and being marketed in connection with the trademarks and logos of such third party vendors, also bear or are marketed in connection with the IsaacMizrahiLIVE trademark and related logo.

&#160;

Under the QVC Agreements, QVC is obligated to make royalty payments to us on a quarterly basis, based upon the net retail sales of the specified respective branded products. Net retail sales are defined as the aggregate amount of all revenue generated through the sale of the specified respective branded products by QVC and its subsidiaries under the QVC Agreements, excluding freight, shipping and handling charges, customer returns, and sales, use or other taxes.

&#160;

Notwithstanding our grant of worldwide promotion rights to QVC, we may, with the permission of QVC, sell the respective branded products (i) to better or prestige retailers, but excluding discount divisions of such companies and mass merchants, (ii) via specifically branded brick-and-mortar retail stores, and (iii) via company websites, in exchange for making reverse royalty payments to QVC based on the net retail sales of such products through such channels. We do not currently sell any of our specified respective branded products that are subject to the QVC Agreements through any of these distribution channels.

&#160;

Also under the QVC Agreements, we will pay a royalty participation fee to QVC on revenue earned from the sale, license, consignment, or any other form of distribution of any products, bearing, marketed in connection with or otherwise associated with the specified respective trademarks and brands.

&#160;

Under the QVC Agreements, we are restricted from selling products under the specified respective brands or trademarks (including the trademarks, copyrights, designs, logos, and related intellectual property themselves) to mass merchants. The QVC Agreements generally prohibit us from selling products under the specified respective brands or any of our other trademarks and brands to a direct competitor of QVC (generally defined as any entity other than QVC whose primary means of deriving revenue is the transmission of direct-response television programs). In addition, during the terms of the IM QVC Agreement, the Ripka QVC Agreement, and the C Wonder QVC Agreement, and for one year thereafter, the respective subsidiary may not, without QVC&#8217;s consent, promote, advertise, endorse or sell (i) the specified branded products through any means or (ii) any products through direct-response television. During the term of the H QVC Agreement, and for one year thereafter, H Licensing may not, without QVC&#8217;s consent, promote, advertise, endorse or sell any products, including the H by Halston brands, through direct-response television.

&#160;

In addition to the forgoing, certain of the QVC Agreements permit us to promote brick-and-mortar collections on QVC&#8217;s television program subject to certain terms and restrictions.

&#160;

While sales under the QVC Agreements have been generated primarily in the United States, we have begun to expand internationally. We commenced sales of our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand through QVC in the United Kingdom in May 2014 and launched the brand through QVC in Italy in August 2015, France in September 2015, and Germany in November 2015. We began selling the Ripka brands through QVC in Japan in May 2015 and in Germany in November 2015. The H by Halston brand was launched on QVC in the United Kingdom in November 2015. We plan to continue to expand our brands internationally through QVC where QVC has or develops an international presence.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, QVC pays the company design fees related to the LCNY brand. Pursuant to an agreement with Kate Spade Company (&#8220;KSC&#8221;), formerly Fifth &#38; Pacific Companies, Inc. and formerly Liz Claiborne, Inc. (the &#8220;LCNY Agreement&#8221;), we provide certain design services related to the LCNY brand, which is sold exclusively through QVC.

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the QVC Agreements collectively accounted for 80% and 79%, respectively, of the total revenues of the Company.

&#160; 

TSC Agreement 

&#160;

We have an agreement with The Shopping Channel, which we refer to as TSC, related to our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand. The agreement grants TSC the exclusive right to sell products under the IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand through its direct-response television programs and related e-commerce and mobile sites for distribution only in Canada, and provides to TSC the right to source products under the brand produced under license by QVC in exchange for paying to QVC a sourcing fee for certain of such products, and the rights granted to TSC remain subject to the restrictions under the IM QVC Agreement. Under the agreement with TSC, we receive a percentage of TSC&#8217;s net sales of products under the IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand.

&#160;

H Halston Licensing Agreement 

&#160;

Pursuant to a trademark license agreement, or the H Halston License Agreement, entered into on December 22, 2014 by and between H Licensing and The H Company IP, LLC, or HIP, H Licensing granted to HIP, a non-assignable exclusive sublicense to use the H Halston trademark in association with the manufacture, distribution, promotion, advertising and sale of products bearing the H Halston trademark and any related services thereto in all channels of distribution, excluding direct-response television and its related e-commerce and digital distribution, and excluding certain mass retailers. HIP shall pay royalties to H Licensing during the term, with a minimum guaranteed royalty of $600,000 per year during the initial term for 2016 through 2024 and $1,200,000 for any year thereafter.

&#160;

On September 1, 2015 we entered into a license agreement with Lord and Taylor, LLC (the &#8220;L&#38;T License&#8221;) and simultaneously amended the H Halston License Agreement eliminating HIP&#8217;s minimum guaranteed royalty obligations, provided the L&#38;T License is in effect. In addition, we entered into a sublicense agreement with HIP obligating us to pay HIP on an annual basis the greater of (i) 50% of royalties received under the L&#38;T License or (ii) guaranteed minimum royalties. Guaranteed minimum royalties are equal to $0.25 million for the seventeen months ending January 31, 2017, and $0.75 million, $0.75 million, $1.5 million and $1.75 million for the twelve months ending January 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.

&#160;

The initial term of the H Halston License Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 unless sooner terminated or renewed. After the initial term, HIP shall be entitled to renew the H Halston License Agreement on three occasions, each for five (5) year terms, as long as HIP is in compliance with all terms and conditions of the agreement. HIP may terminate the agreement prior to the expiration of the initial term without penalties, fees or payment of future royalties upon 90 days&#8217; notice prior to the second anniversary of the closing. In the event HIP exercises its early termination right, H Licensing shall pay to HIP a participation fee for each of the three following years in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 ($5,000,000 if H Licensing distributes, or otherwise enters into any agreements for the distribution of products bearing the H Halston trademark in China). The participation fee, if any, may be paid in cash or shares of Xcel&#8217;s common stock based on the greater of $8.00 and the value weighted average price of the common stock for the five business days preceding payment.

&#160;

Other Licensing Agreements 

&#160;

We have entered into numerous other licensing agreements for sales and distribution through the internet and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Authorized distribution channels include department stores such as Lord &#38; Taylor, Macy&#8217;s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom&#8217;s, and Saks Fifth Avenue, off-price retailers such as Neiman&#8217;s Last Call, Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off Fifth, and TJX (including TJ Maxx, Marshall&#8217;s and Home Goods), and national specialty retailers such as 1-800-FLOWERS, Best Buy and Michaels. Under our other licenses, a supplier is granted rights, typically on an exclusive basis, to a single or small group of related product categories for sale to multiple accounts within an approved channel of distribution and territory. Our other license agreements typically provide the licensee with the exclusive rights for a certain product category in a specified territory and/or distribution channel. Our other license agreements cover various categories, including but not limited to women&#8217;s footwear, accessories, and bridal gowns; fragrance, bath and body; jewelry; home products; men&#8217;s apparel and accessories; children&#8217;s and infant apparel, footwear and accessories; and electronics cases and accessories. The terms of the agreements generally range from three to six years with renewal options.

&#160;

The L&#38;T License provides Lord and Taylor LLC the right to use certain of our Isaac Mizrahi, H Halston, and C Wonder trademarks to sell our respective brands&#8217; products in any retail stores operated by Lord and Taylor, LLC located in the US, Canada, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany. The L&#38;T License provides Lord and Taylor an exclusive right for certain categories under each brand, provided they must maintain minimum annual sales for each designated category. The initial term of the L&#38;T License expires January 31, 2021, subject to certain rights of Lord and Taylor to terminate the L&#38;T License sooner.

&#160;

We are in discussions with other potential licensees and strategic partners to license and/or co-brand the Mizrahi brands, Ripka brands, H Halston brands, and C Wonder brands for additional categories. In certain cases, we have engaged licensing agents to assist in the procurement of such licenses for which IM Brands, JR Licensing, H Licensing, CW Licensing, or our licensees pay such agents&#8217; fees based upon a percentage of the net sales of licensed products by such licensees, or a percentage of the royalty payments that we receive from such licensees. While many of the new and proposed licensing agreements will likely require us to provide seasonal design guidance, most of our new and prospective licensing partners have their own design staff, and we therefore expect low incremental overhead costs related to expanding our licensing business. We will endeavor, where possible, to require licensees to provide guaranteed minimum royalties under their license agreements.

&#160;

Our licensees currently plan to sell our branded licensed products through brick-and-mortar retailers, internet websites, for certain categories, through our e-commerce site, and in certain cases supply products to QVC, The Shopping Channel, and/or other direct-response television companies for sale through their television programs and/or through their internet websites. We generally recognize revenues from our other licenses based on a percentage of the sales of products under our brands, but excluding sales of products to direct-response television networks, where we receive a retail royalty directly from the direct-response television licensee, and sales of products to e-commerce sites operated by us. Additionally, based upon guaranteed minimum royalty provisions required under many of the license agreements, we are able to recognize revenue related to certain other licenses based on the greater of the sales-based royalty or the guaranteed minimum royalty.

&#160;

Revenue from these other licensing agreements discussed above represented approximately 14% and 12% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

Design and Promotional Services 

&#160; 

We provide design and other services to certain of our licensees and, in some cases, to select brands owned by third parties. In particular, we provide all design services to QVC for products sold under the IM QVC Agreement, Ripka QVC Agreement, H QVC Agreement, C Wonder QVC Agreement, LCNY Agreement and design services to Lord and Taylor under the L&#38;T License. This includes seasonal design guidance, product development and merchandising, product design and sample review and approvals through our in-house design organization. Additionally, the Company provides limited design services under the wholesale licenses which may include seasonal design guidance (such as style guides) and/or print and pattern development, for which certain of our licensees pay us fixed fees for such services as determined in their agreements. In general, the design of products under our wholesale licenses is expected to be completed by the licensees at our direction.

&#160;

In certain cases, the Company provides promotional services to other brands or companies, which may include the use of our brands for the promotion of such company or brands through the internet, television, or other digital content, print media or other marketing campaigns featuring, in-person appearances by our celebrity spokespersons, the development of limited collections of products (which may include co-branded products) for such company, or other services as determined on a case-by-case basis. These include promotions with General Motors, Johnson &#38; Johnson, and Kleenex.

&#160;

The Company employs design and production oversight teams to provide the aforementioned services. The Company may consider appropriate opportunities to leverage its resources to provide design services, production oversight or other resources to selected brands that are not owned by the Company in the future.

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160;

We had a full-price store and an outlet store under the Mizrahi brands during 2014. In December 2014, we decided to close our retail stores. Accordingly, our retail operation was treated as discontinued operations. We have continued our e-commerce operations, which were previously reported as a component of retail operations, as a component of our licensing business. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Discontinued Operations.&#8221;

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160;

Marketing is a critical element to maximize brand value to our licensees and our Company. Therefore, we provide social media marketing and other marketing and public relations support for our brands.

&#160;

Given our omni-channel retail sales strategy focusing on the sale of branded products through various distribution channels (including internet, direct-response television, and traditional brick-and-mortar sales channels), our marketing efforts currently focus on social media campaigns, personal appearances, and digital content in order to drive retail sales of product and consumer awareness across our various sales distribution channels. We seek to create the intersection where shopping, entertainment, and social meet. As such, our marketing is currently conducted primarily through (i) Twitter campaigns, (ii) Facebook campaigns, (iii) Instagram, (iv) Pinterest, and (v) blogs, videos, images, and other internet content that are all updated regularly. Our efforts also include promoting namesakes of our brands and our personalities through various media including television (such as Project Runway All-Stars and Live with Kelly and Michael ), design for performances, and other events. We also work with QVC to leverage QVC&#8217;s internet resources including discussion boards, Facebook and Twitter campaigns, and QVC&#8217;s website.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our agreements with QVC allow our brand celebrities and spokespersons to promote our non-QVC product lines and strategic partnerships under our brands through QVC&#8217;s programs, subject to certain parameters including the payment of a portion of our non-QVC revenues to QVC. We believe that this provides us with the ability to leverage QVC&#8217;s media platform (including television, internet, and social media reach to over 2 million Facebook fans and 2.8 million monthly forum posts) and QVC&#8217;s customer base of approximately 350 million households worldwide to cross-promote products in and drive traffic to our other channels of distribution. Many of our licensees make advertising and marketing contributions to the Company under their license agreements which are used to fund marketing-related expenses and further promote our brands as we deem appropriate. Certain of the wholesale licenses contain requirements to provide advertising or marketing for the Mizrahi brands, Ripka brands, H Halston brands, and C Wonder brand under their respective license agreements with IM Brands, JR Licensing, H Licensing, and C Wonder Licensing.

&#160;

We also market the Mizrahi brands through www.isaacmizrahi.com, the Ripka brands through www.judithripka.com and C Wonder brands through www.cwonder.com. Through our websites, we are able to present and promote a collection of products under our brands to customers with branding and signage that reflects each brand&#8217;s heritage and unique point-of-view. Additionally, we plan to conduct online marketing campaigns for the brands, which may include search engine optimization, referral sites, online promotions and content, and other efforts.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Each of our current brands and any future acquired brand will likely have many competitors within each of its specific distribution channels that span a broad variety of product categories, including the apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home furnishings and d&#233;cor, food products and sporting goods industries. These competitors have the ability to compete with the Company and our licensees in terms of fashion, quality, price, products and/or marketing.

&#160;

Because many of our competitors have significantly more cash, revenues and resources than we do, we must work to differentiate ourselves from our direct and indirect competitors to successfully compete for market share with the brands we own and for future acquisitions. We believe that the following factors help differentiate our Company in an increasingly crowded competitive landscape:

&#160;

&#8226; our management team, including our officers&#8217; and directors&#8217; historical track records and relationships within the industry; &#160;

&#8226; our brand management platform, which has a strong focus on design and marketing; and &#160;

&#8226; our operating strategy of licensing brands with significant media presence and driving sales through our omni-channel retail sales strategy across direct-response television, brick-and-mortar and internet distribution channels. &#160;

We expect our existing and future licenses to relate to products in the apparel, fashion accessories, jewelry, footwear, beauty and fragrance, home products and d&#233;cor, pet products, fabrics and yarns and other consumer industries, in which our licensees face intense competition, including from our other brands and licensees. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service. In addition, various fads and the limited availability of shelf space could affect competition for our licensees&#8217; products. Many of our licensees&#8217; competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brand names. Our licensees may be unable to successfully compete in the markets for their products, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.

&#160;

We face significant competition with our e-commerce business as it competes with other online retailers, other direct-to-consumer sales channels and retail stores operated by companies that sell brands that are competitive with the Company&#8217;s brands. Additionally, due to their financial resources, margins, or store counts, our competitors may be able to better market their retail locations or e-commerce sites, and may undercut the pricing of products that we sell through our e-commerce platform which could lower sales or erode our margins.

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns and exploits the Mizrahi brands, which include the trademarks and brands Isaac Mizrahi, Isaac Mizrahi New York, and IsaacMizrahiLIVE; the Ripka brands, which include the trademarks and brands Judith Ripka LTD, Judith Ripka Collection, Judith Ripka Legacy, Judith Ripka, and Judith Ripka Sterling; two Halston-formative brands and trademarks, namely, H by Halston and H Halston; and the C Wonder brands, which include the trademarks and brands C Wonder and C Wonder Limited.

&#160;

The H by Halston and H Halston brands were acquired on December 22, 2014, however certain U.S. applications for registration that are based upon intent-to-use currently sit in the name of HIP, from whom we purchased the marks, until such time as the marks are put into use and assigned to us. In certain jurisdictions, certain H by Halston and H Halston trademark registrations or applications that we purchased (including but not limited to those based upon &#8220;intent to use&#8221;) may not yet be recorded in our name, due to laws governing the timing and nature of certain trademark assignments.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Where laws limit our ability to record in our name trademarks that we have purchased, we have obtained by way of license all necessary rights to operate our business. Certain of these trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary designs for use in connection with a variety of product categories, such as apparel, footwear and various other goods and services including, in some cases, home furnishings and decor. The Company intends to renew and maintain registrations as appropriate prior to expiration and it makes efforts to diligently prosecute all pending applications consistent with the Company&#8217;s business goals. In addition, the Company registers its trademarks in certain other countries and regions around the world as it deems appropriate.

&#160;

The Company and its licensees do not presently earn a material amount of revenue from either the licensing of our trademarks internationally or the sale of products under our trademarks internationally. However, the Company has registered its trademarks in certain territories where it expects that it may do business in the foreseeable future. If the Company or a licensee intends to make use of the trademarks in international territories, the Company will seek to register its trademarks in such international territories as it deems appropriate based upon factors including the revenue potential, prospective market and trademark laws in such territory or territories.

&#160;

Generally, the Company is primarily responsible for monitoring and protecting its trademarks around the world. The Company seeks to require its licensing partners to advise the Company of any violations of its trademark rights of which its licensing partners become aware and relies primarily upon a combination of federal, state, and local laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect its intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 77 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and various environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.
