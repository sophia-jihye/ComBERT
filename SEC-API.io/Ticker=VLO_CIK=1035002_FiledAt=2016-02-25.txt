Refined products are distributed via pipeline systems to various third-party terminals in southern California, Nevada, and Arizona. 

Feedstock Supply 

Approximately 59 percent of our current crude oil feedstock requirements are purchased through term contracts while the remaining requirements are generally purchased on the spot market. Our term supply agreements include arrangements to purchase feedstocks at market-related prices directly or indirectly from various national oil companies as well as international and U.S. oil companies. The contracts generally permit the parties to amend the contracts (or terminate them), effective as of the next scheduled renewal date, by giving the other party proper notice within a prescribed period of time ( e.g ., 60 days, 6 months) before expiration of the current term. The majority of the crude oil purchased under our term contracts is purchased at the producer&#8217;s official stated price ( i.e ., the &#8220;market&#8221; price established by the seller for all purchasers) and not at a negotiated price specific to us. 

Refining Segment Sales 

Overview 

Our refining segment includes sales of refined products in both the wholesale rack and bulk markets. These sales include refined products that are manufactured in our refining operations as well as refined products purchased or received on exchange from third parties. Most of our refineries have access to marine transportation facilities and interconnect with common-carrier pipeline systems, allowing us to sell products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and other countries. 

Wholesale Marketing 

We market branded and unbranded refined products on a wholesale basis through an extensive rack marketing network. The principal purchasers of our refined products from terminal truck racks are wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and truck-delivered end users throughout the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Ireland. 

The majority of our rack volume is sold through unbranded channels. The remainder is sold to distributors and dealers that are members of the Valero-brand family that operate approximately 5,700 branded sites in the U.S. and the Caribbean, approximately 1,000 branded sites in the U.K. and Ireland, and approximately 800 branded sites in Canada. These sites are independently owned and are supplied by us under multi-year contracts. For wholesale branded sites, we promote the Valero &#174; , Beacon &#174; , Diamond Shamrock &#174; , and Shamrock &#174; &#32;brands in the U.S. and the Caribbean, the Texaco &#174; &#32;brand in the U.K. and Ireland, and we license the Ultramar &#174; &#32;brand in Canada. 

Bulk Sales and Trading 

We sell a significant portion of our gasoline and distillate production through bulk sales channels in U.S. and international markets. Our bulk sales are made to various oil companies and traders as well as certain bulk end-users such as railroads, airlines, and utilities. Our bulk sales are transported primarily by pipeline, barges, and tankers to major tank farms and trading hubs. 

We also enter into refined product exchange and purchase agreements. These agreements help minimize transportation costs, optimize refinery utilization, balance refined product availability, broaden geographic distribution, and provide access to markets not connected to our refined-product pipeline systems. Exchange agreements provide for the delivery of refined products by us to unaffiliated companies at our and third-parties&#8217; terminals in exchange for delivery of a similar amount of refined products to us by these unaffiliated companies at specified locations. Purchase agreements involve our purchase of refined products from third parties with delivery occurring at specified locations. 

Specialty Products 

We sell a variety of other products produced at our refineries, which we refer to collectively as &#8220;Specialty Products.&#8221; Our Specialty Products include asphalt, lube oils, natural gas liquids (NGLs), petroleum coke, petrochemicals, and sulfur. 

&#8226; 

We produce asphalt at five of our refineries. Our asphalt products are sold for use in road construction, road repair, and roofing applications through a network of refinery and terminal loading racks. 

&#8226; 

We produce naphthenic oils at one of our refineries suitable for a wide variety of lubricant and process applications. 

&#8226; 

NGLs produced at our refineries include butane, isobutane, and propane. These products can be used for gasoline blending, home heating, and petrochemical plant feedstocks. 

&#8226; 

We are a significant producer of petroleum coke, supplying primarily power generation customers and cement manufacturers. Petroleum coke is used largely as a substitute for coal. 

&#8226; 

We produce and market a number of commodity petrochemicals including aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) and two grades of propylene. Aromatics and propylenes are sold to customers in the chemical industry for further processing into such products as paints, plastics, and adhesives. 

&#8226; 

We are a large producer of sulfur with sales primarily to customers serving the agricultural sector. Sulfur is used in manufacturing fertilizer. 

Logistics and Transportation 

We own several transportation and logistics assets (crude oil pipelines, refined product pipelines, terminals, tanks, marine docks, truck rack bays, rail cars, and rail facilities) that support our refining and ethanol operations. In addition, through subsidiaries, we own the 2.0 percent general partner interest in Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP) and a 65.7 percent limited partner interest in VLP. VLP is a midstream master limited partnership. Its common units, representing limited partner interests, are traded on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;VLP.&#8221; Its assets support the operations of our Ardmore, Corpus Christi, Houston, McKee, Memphis, Port Arthur, St. Charles, and Three Rivers Refineries. VLP is discussed more fully in Note 4 &#32;of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ETHANOL 

We own 11 ethanol plants with a combined ethanol production capacity of about 1.4 billion gallons per year. Our ethanol plants are dry mill facilities 1 that process corn to produce ethanol and distillers grains. 2 We source our corn supply from local farmers and commercial elevators. Our facilities receive corn primarily by rail and truck. We publish on our website a corn bid for local farmers and cooperative dealers to use to facilitate corn supply transactions. 

After processing, our ethanol is held in storage tanks on-site pending loading to rail cars, trucks and barges. We sell our ethanol (i) to large customers&#8211;primarily refiners and gasoline blenders&#8211;under term and spot contracts, and (ii) in bulk markets such as New York, Chicago, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, and the U.S. West Coast. We ship our dry distillers grains (DDG) by truck or rail primarily to animal feed customers in the U.S. and Mexico, with some sales into the Far East. We also sell modified distillers grains locally at our plant sites.

________________________ 

1 &#160; 

Ethanol is commercially produced using either the wet mill or dry mill process. Wet milling involves separating the grain kernel into its component parts (germ, fiber, protein, and starch) prior to fermentation. In the dry mill process, the entire grain kernel is ground into flour. The starch in the flour is converted to ethanol during the fermentation process, creating carbon dioxide and distillers grains. 

2 &#160; 

During fermentation, nearly all of the starch in the grain is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, while the remaining nutrients (proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins) are concentrated to yield modified distillers grains, or, after further drying, dried distillers grains. Distillers grains generally are an economical partial replacement for corn and soybeans in feeds for cattle, swine, and poultry.
