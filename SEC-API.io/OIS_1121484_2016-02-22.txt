Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We have in past years grown our business lines both organically through capital spending and through strategic acquisitions. Our investments are focused in growth areas and on areas where we expect we can expand market share and where we believe we can achieve an attractive return on our investment. We have seen investment opportunities in shale play regions in North America and in the expansion of our capabilities to manufacture and assemble deepwater capital equipment on a global basis. As part of our long-term strategy, we continue to review complementary acquisitions as well as make organic capital expenditures to enhance our cash flows and increase our shareholders&#8217; returns. For additional discussion of our business strategy, please read Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Capital Spending and Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Capital spending over the last several years has included both growth and maintenance capital expenditures in each of our businesses. Capital spending totaled $479 million over the three-year period 2013 to 2015. 

&#160; 

In addition to capital spending, we have invested $78 million over the three-year period 2013 to 2015 for acquisitions of businesses. Acquisitions of other oilfield service businesses have been an important aspect of our growth strategy and plan to increase shareholder value. Our acquisition strategy has allowed us to leverage our existing and acquired products and services into new geographic locations, and has expanded our technology and product offerings. We have made strategic acquisitions in each of our business segments in recent years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

On January 2, 2015, we acquired all of the equity of Montgomery Machine Company, Inc. (MMC). Headquartered in Houston, Texas, MMC combines machining and proprietary cladding technology and services to manufacture high-specification components for the offshore capital equipment industry on a global basis. We believe that the acquisition of MMC will strengthen our position in our offshore products segment as a supplier of subsea components with enhanced capabilities, proprietary technology and logistical advantages. Total transaction consideration was $33.4 million, net of cash acquired. 

&#160; 

On December 2, 2013, we acquired all of the operating assets of Quality Connector Systems, LLC (QCS) for total cash consideration of $42.3 million. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, QCS designs, manufactures and markets a portfolio of proprietary deep and shallow water pipeline connectors for subsea pipeline construction, repair and expansion projects. The operations of QCS have been included in our offshore products segment since the acquisition date. 

&#160; 

The Company funded these acquisitions with cash on hand and/or amounts available under our credit facilities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our senior secured bank facilities. 

&#160; 

Our Industry 

&#160; 

We principally operate in the oilfield services industry and provide a broad range of products and services to our customers through each of our business segments. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for financial information by segment and a geographical breakout of revenues and long-lived assets for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry, particularly our customers&#39; willingness to invest capital on the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas. Our customers&#8217; capital spending programs are generally based on their outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices, economic growth, commodity demand and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expected commodity prices, principally related to crude oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

Our historical financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business. Since 2001, there have been periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments. For additional information about activities in each of our segments, please see &#8220;Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

During 2013 and the first three quarters of 2014, we benefited from high oil prices resulting in very active bidding and quoting activity for our offshore products segment. However, beginning early in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing throughout 2015, crude oil prices decreased significantly. Bidding and quoting activity for our offshore products segment continued during 2015, albeit at a slower pace. Accordingly, backlog in our offshore products segment decreased to $340 million at December 31, 2015 from $490 million at December 31, 2014 and $580 million at December 31, 2013 due to project deferrals and delays in award timing resulting from the continued depressed commodity price environment. 

&#160; 

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, crude oil prices began a precipitous fall, with WTI decreasing from a June peak price per barrel of $107.95 to $30.77 per barrel as of February 18, 2016. These materially lower commodity prices have, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the cash flows of our customers forcing them to cut capital expenditures and control costs, which have, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Global deepwater spending has been and could continue to be negatively impacted as a result which may lead to further backlog declines in our offshore products segment during 2016 along with reduced revenues and profitability. Also due to this environment, we have an increased risk of project cancellations and contractual modifications. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our well site services business segment is primarily affected by drilling and completion activity in the U.S., including the Gulf of Mexico, and, to a lesser extent, Canada and the rest of the world. U.S. drilling and completion activity and, thus, our well site services results, are especially sensitive to near-term fluctuations in commodity prices and have, therefore, been significantly negatively affected by the material decline in crude oil prices from 2014 to the current date. 

&#160; 

In the past few years, our industry has experienced a shift in spending from natural gas exploration and development to crude oil and liquids-rich exploration and development in the North American shale plays utilizing horizontal drilling and completion techniques. According to the most current rig count data published by Baker Hughes Incorporated, the U.S. oil rig count peaked in October 2014 at 1,609 rigs but has declined materially in recent months due to much lower crude oil prices, totaling 439 rigs as of February 12, 2016. The February 12, 2016 oil rig count comprised approximately 81% of total U.S. drilling activity. The remaining 19% of drilling activity is largely natural gas related. The U.S. natural gas-related working rig count has declined from more than 810 rigs at the beginning of 2012 to 102 rigs as of February 12, 2016, a more than 28 year low. Unless commodity prices improve, we expect that the rig count and demand from our customers for our well site services will remain low during 2016. 

&#160; 

In response to the adverse effects in 2015 of the materially lower commodity prices on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the Company implemented various cost-saving measures, including the closing of underperforming completion services locations and company-wide headcount reductions that total approximately 33% since the beginning of 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Offshore Products 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 66% of our revenue and 74% of our gross margin from our offshore products segment. Through this segment, we design and manufacture a number of cost-effective, technologically advanced products for the offshore energy industry. In addition, we supply other lower margin products and services such as fabrication and inspection services. Our products and services are used primarily in deepwater producing regions and include flex-element technology, advanced connector systems, high-pressure riser systems, compact valves, deepwater mooring systems, cranes, subsea pipeline products, blow-out preventer stack integration, specialty welding, cladding and machining services, offshore installation services and repair services. We have facilities that support our offshore products segment in Arlington, Houston and Lampasas, Texas; Houma, Louisiana; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Scotland; Brazil; England; Singapore; Thailand; Vietnam; and India. 

&#160; 

Offshore Products Market 

&#160; 

The market for our offshore products and services depends primarily upon development of infrastructure for offshore production activities, drilling rig refurbishments and upgrades as well as new rig and vessel construction. Demand for oil and natural gas and related drilling and production in offshore areas throughout the world, particularly in deeper water, drive spending for these activities. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

In operation for over 70 years, our offshore products segment provides a broad range of products and services for use in offshore drilling and development activities. To a lesser extent, this segment also provides onshore oil and natural gas, defense and general industrial products and services. Our offshore products segment is dependent in part on the industry&#39;s continuing innovation and creative applications of existing technologies. We own patents covering some of our technology, particularly in our connector and valve product lines. 

&#160; 

Offshore Development and Drilling Activities. We design, manufacture, fabricate, inspect, assemble, repair, test and market subsea equipment and offshore vessel and rig equipment. Our products are components of equipment used for the drilling and production of oil and natural gas wells on offshore fixed platforms and mobile production units, including floating platforms, such as tension leg platforms, floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, Spars, and on other marine vessels, floating rigs and jack-up rigs. Our products and services include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

flexible bearings and advanced connection systems; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

casing and conductor connections and pipe; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

other products and services. 

&#160; 

Flexible Bearings and Advanced Connection Systems. We are a significant supplier of flexible bearings, or FlexJoint &#174; , to the offshore oil and gas industry as well as weld-on connectors and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductor or casing used in offshore drilling and production operations. A FlexJoint &#174; is a flexible bearing that permits the controlled movement of riser or tension leg platform tethers under high tension and pressure. A FlexJoint &#174; or our flex element at the top, bottom and, in some cases, middle of a deepwater riser reduces the stress and tension on the riser compensating for the pitch and rotational forces on the riser as the production facility or drilling rig moves with ocean forces. They are used on drilling, production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water areas. Drilling riser systems provide the vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead. Through the drilling riser, equipment is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface. Production riser systems provide the vertical conduit for the hydrocarbons from the subsea wellhead to the floating production facility. Oil and natural gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser. Export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production facility to the subsea export pipelines. Our FlexJoint &#174; bearings are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater. 

&#160; 

Floating production systems, including tension leg platforms, Spars and FPSO facilities, are a significant means of producing oil and natural gas, particularly in deepwater environments. We provide many important products for the construction of these facilities. A tension leg platform (TLP) is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes, or tethers, attached to both the platform and the sea floor. Our FlexJoint &#174; tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers, and our Merlin&#8482; connectors are used to efficiently assemble the tethers during offshore installation. An FPSO is a floating vessel, typically ship shaped, used to produce, and process oil and natural gas from subsea wells. A Spar is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place. Our FlexJoint &#174; bearings are also used to attach the steel catenary risers to an FPSO, tension leg platform or Spar, and for use on import or export risers. 

&#160; 

Casing and Conductor Connections and Pipe . Our advanced connection systems provide connectors used in various drilling and production applications offshore. These connectors are welded onto pipe to provide more efficient joint to joint connections with enhanced tensile and burst capabilities that exceed those of connections that are cut into plain end pipe. Our connectors are reusable and pliable and in some cases provide metal-to-metal seals. We offer a suite of connectors offering differing specifications depending on the application. Our Merlin&#8482; connectors are our premier connectors combining superior static strength and fatigue life with fast, non-rotational make-up and a slim profile. Merlin&#8482; connectors have been used in sizes up to 60 inches (outside diameter) for applications including open-hole and tie-back casing, offshore conductor casing, pipeline risers and TLP tendons (which moor the TLP to the sea floor). 

&#160; 

These flexible bearings and advanced connector systems are primarily manufactured through our Arlington, Texas, U.K. and Singapore locations. 

&#160; 

Subsea Pipeline Products. We design and manufacture a variety of equipment used in the construction, maintenance, expansion and repair of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines. New construction equipment includes: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

pipeline end manifolds and pipeline end terminals; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

deep and shallow water pipeline connectors; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

midline tie-in sleds; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

forged steel Y-shaped connectors for joining two pipelines into one; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

pressure-balanced safety joints for protecting pipelines and related equipment from anchor snags or a shifting sea-bottom; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

electrical isolation joints; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

hot tap clamps that allow new pipelines to be joined into existing lines without interrupting the flow of petroleum product. 

&#160; 

We provide diverless connection systems for subsea flowlines and pipelines. Our HydroTech &#174; collet connectors provide a high-integrity, proprietary metal-to-metal sealing system for the final hook-up of deep offshore pipelines and production systems. They also are used in diverless pipeline repair systems and in future pipeline tie-in systems. Our lateral tie-in sled, which is installed with the original pipeline, allows a subsea tie-in to be made quickly and efficiently using proven HydroTech &#174; connectors without costly offshore equipment mobilization and without shutting off product flow. 

&#160; 

We provide pipeline repair hardware, including deepwater applications beyond the depth of diver intervention. Our products include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

repair clamps used to seal leaks and restore the structural integrity of a pipeline; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

mechanical connectors used in repairing subsea pipelines without having to weld; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

misalignment and swivel ring flanges; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

pipe recovery tools for recovering dropped or damaged pipelines. 

&#160; 

Our subsea pipeline products are primarily designed and manufactured at three of our Houston, Texas manufacturing locations. 

&#160; 

Compact Ball Valves, Manifold System Components and Diverter Valves. Our Piper division designs and manufactures compact high pressure valves and manifold system components for all environments of the oil and gas industry including onshore, offshore, drilling and subsea applications. Our valve and manifold bores are designed to closely match the inside diameter of the required pipe schedule for the system working pressure. The result is elimination of piping transition areas that minimize erosion and system friction pressure loss, resulting in a more efficient flow path. Our floating ball valve design with its large ball/seat interface has over 30 years of field service experience in upstream unprocessed produced liquids and gasses, assuring reliable service. Oil States Piper Valve Optimum Flow Technology is our way of helping end users maximize space, minimize weight and increase production. These products are designed and manufactured at our Oklahoma City, Oklahoma location. 

&#160; 

Marine Winches, Mooring Systems, Cranes and other Heavy-Lift Rig Equipment. We design, engineer and manufacture marine winches, mooring systems, cranes and certain rig equipment. Our Skagit &#174; winches are specifically designed for mooring floating and semi-submersible drilling rigs and positioning pipelay and derrick barges, anchor handling boats and jack-ups, while our Nautilus &#174; marine cranes are used on production platforms throughout the world. We also design and fabricate rig equipment such as automatic pipe racking and blow-out preventer handling equipment. Our engineering teams, manufacturing capability and service technicians who install and service our products provide our customers with a broad range of equipment and services to support their operations. Aftermarket service and support of our installed base of equipment to our customers is also an important source of revenue to us. These products are designed at our Houma, Louisiana location and manufactured at our Houma, Louisiana; Navi Mumbai, India; and Rayong, Thailand locations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Production, Workover, Completion and Drilling Riser Systems and their related repair services. Utilizing the expertise of our welding technology group, we have extended the boundaries of our Merlin&#8482; connector technology with the design and manufacture of multiple riser systems. The unique Merlin&#8482; connection has proven to be a robust solution for even the most demanding high-pressure (up to 10,000 psi) riser systems used in high-fatigue, deepwater applications. Our riser systems are designed to meet a range of static and fatigue stresses on a par with those of our Tension Leg Elements (TLE) connectors. The connector can be welded or machined directly onto upset riser pipe and provide sufficient material to perform "re-cuts" after extended service. Our marine riser offers superior tension capabilities together with one of the fastest run times in the industry. Auxiliary riser system components and running tools can be provided along with full service inspection and repair of these riser systems by our facilities worldwide. 

&#160; 

BOP Stack Assembly, Integration, Testing and Repair Services. While we do not manufacture BOP stack assemblies, we design and fabricate lifting and protection frames and offer system integration of blow-out preventer stacks and subsea production trees. We can provide complete turnkey and design fabrication services. We also design and manufacture a variety of custom subsea equipment, such as riser flotation tank systems, guide bases, running tools and manifolds. In addition, we also offer blow-out preventer and drilling riser testing and repair services. These assembly and testing services are offered through our Houston, Texas, U.K., Singapore and Brazil locations. 

&#160; 

Consumable Downhole Products . Shale gas exploration has expanded the need for more advanced completion tools. To reduce well completion cost, the time to drill out tools is very important. We have leveraged our knowledge of molded thermoset composites and elastomers to help meet this demand, and as a result, we have seen growth in casing and cementing products, valves, and combination plugs. One example, the molded frac ball market, has grown from a few thousand units in 2009 to nearly five hundred thousand units in 2015. Additional products include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Swab Cups - used primarily in well servicing work; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Rod Guides/Centralizers - used in both drilling and production for pipe protection; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Gate Valve and Butterfly Valve Seats &#8211; we service many markets in the valve industry including well completion, refining, and distribution; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Casing and Cementing products &#8211; we are a leading custom manufacturer of cementing plugs, well bore wipers, valve assemblies, combination plugs, specialty seals and gaskets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Service Tools &#8211; our products include frac balls, packer elements, zonal isolation tools, as well as many custom molded products used in the well servicing industry. 

&#160; 

We have also had success in developing and producing composite drillable zonal isolation tools (i.e., bridge / frac plugs) utilizing design and production techniques to reduce cost while still delivering high quality products. Time to drill out has been reduced significantly in comparison to other filament wound products in the market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Products &#38; Services. Our offshore products segment also produces a variety of products for use in applications other than in the offshore oil and gas industry. For example, we provide: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

sound and vibration isolation equipment for the U.S. Navy submarine fleet; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

metal-elastomeric FlexJoint &#174; bearings used in a variety of naval and marine applications; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

drum-clutches and brakes for heavy-duty power transmission in the mining, paper, logging and marine industries. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Backlog. Backlog in our offshore products segment was $340 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $490 million at December 31, 2014 and $580 million at December 31, 2013. We expect approximately 80% of our backlog at December 31, 2015 to be recognized as revenue during 2016. Our offshore products backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled. In some instances, these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. While backlog cancellations have not been significant in the past, we incurred cancellations totaling $21.1 million during 2015 ($3.4 million occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015), which we believe is attributable to lower commodity prices and the resultant decrease in capital spending by our clients, and additional cancellations may occur in the future, further reducing our backlog. Our backlog is an important indicator of future offshore products shipments and revenues; however, backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period. We believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long "lead-time" order cycle. The change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long-term trend. 

&#160; 

Regions of Operations 

&#160; 

Our offshore products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore oil and natural gas producing regions of the world, including the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Azerbaijan, the North Sea, Brazil, Southeast Asia, India and Australia. 

&#160; 

Customers and Competitors 

&#160; 

We market our products and services to a broad customer base, including direct end users, engineering and design companies, prime contractors, and at times, our competitors through outsourcing arrangements. Our largest customers in this segment in 2015 were Halliburton Company, Hess Corporation and Saipem S.p.A. Our main competitors include Cameron International Corporation, FMC Technologies, Inc., Dril-Quip, Inc., National Oilwell Varco, Inc., GE Oil &#38; Gas (a division of General Electric Company) and Liebherr Cranes, Inc. 

&#160; 

Well Site Services 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 34% of our revenue and 26% of our gross margin from our well site services segment. Our well site services segment includes a broad range of products and services that are used to drill for, establish and maintain the flow of oil and natural gas from a well throughout its life cycle. In this segment, our operations primarily include completion-focused equipment and services as well as land drilling services. We use our fleet of completion tools and drilling rigs to serve our customers at well sites and project development locations. Our products and services are used both in onshore and offshore applications throughout the drilling, completion and production phases of a well&#39;s life cycle. 

&#160; 

Well Site Services Market 

&#160; 

Demand for our completion services and drilling services is predominantly tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity on land in the United States. The primary driver for this activity is the price of crude oil and natural gas. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our completion services equipment is primarily used during the completion and production stages of a well. As of December 31, 2015, we provided completion services at approximately 43 distribution points throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Argentina. We continue to consolidate operations in areas where our product lines previously had separate facilities and have closed facilities in areas where operations are marginal in order to streamline operations and enhance our facilities to improve operational efficiency. We typically provide our services and equipment based on daily rates which vary depending on the type of equipment and the length of the job. Billings to our customers typically separate charges for our equipment from charges for our field technicians. We own patents or have patents pending covering some of our technology, particularly in our wellhead isolation equipment and downhole extended-reach technology product lines. Our customers in the completion services business include major, independent and private oil and gas companies and other large oilfield service companies. Our largest customers in this segment in 2015 were Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation and Noble Energy Incorporated. Competition in the completion services business is widespread and includes many smaller companies, although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain products and services. 

&#160; 

Drilling Services. Our drilling services business, which is marketed under the brand name Capstar Drilling, is located in the United States and provides land drilling services for shallow to medium depth wells generally of less than 10,000 to 12,000 feet and, under more limited conditions, up to 15,000 feet. We serve two primary markets with our drilling services business: the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Rocky Mountain region. Drilling services are typically used during the exploration and development stages of a field. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of thirty-four semi-automatic drilling rigs with hydraulic pipe handling booms and lift capacities ranging from 150,000 to 500,000 pounds, fifteen of which were fabricated and/or assembled in our Odessa, Texas facility during the last ten years with components purchased from specialty vendors. Twenty-four of these drilling rigs are based in the Permian Basin and ten are based in the Rocky Mountain region. Utilization of our drilling rigs decreased from an average of 87% in 2014 to an average of 33% in 2015 due to lower crude oil prices and, on December 31, 2015, only five of our rigs, or 15%, were working or under contract. We believe that we may experience additional reductions in the utilization of our drilling rigs if commodity prices do not improve or decline further. 

&#160; 

We market our drilling services directly to a diverse customer base, consisting primarily of independent and private oil and gas companies. We contract on both a footage and a dayrate basis. Under a footage drilling contract, we assume responsibility for certain costs (such as bits and fuel) and assume more risk (such as time necessary to drill) than we would on a daywork contract. Depending on market conditions and availability of drilling rigs, we see changes in pricing, utilization and contract terms. Our largest drilling services customers in 2015 were Energen Resources Corporation (representing 26% of our drilling services revenues in 2015), Apache Corporation and Crescent Point Energy US Corporation. The land drilling business is highly fragmented, and our competition consists of a small number of larger companies and many smaller companies. Our Permian Basin drilling activities target primarily oil reservoirs while our Rocky Mountain drilling activities target oil, liquids-rich and natural gas reservoirs.

Seasonality of Operations 

&#160; 

Our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain region, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region can restrict access to work areas for our well site services segment operations. Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico are also affected by weather patterns. Weather conditions in the Gulf Coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring, summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months. In addition, summer and fall drilling activity can be interrupted by hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. A portion of our completion services operations in Canada is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these regions restricts operations in the second quarter of our fiscal year and adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed 3,586 full-time employees on a consolidated basis, 42% of whom are in our well site services segment, 56% of whom are in our offshore products segment and 2% of whom are in our corporate headquarters. We were party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 27 employees located in Argentina and the United Kingdom as of December 31, 2015. We believe we have good labor relations with our employees. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is significantly affected by foreign and domestic laws and regulations at the federal, provincial, state and local levels relating to the oil and natural gas industry, worker safety and environmental protection. To the extent that these laws and regulations impose more stringent requirements or increased costs or delays upon our customers in the performance of their operations, the resulting demand for our products and services by those customers may be adversely affected, which impact could be significant and long-lasting. Moreover, changes in these laws and regulations, including the implementation of more restrictive standards and increased levels of enforcement, could significantly affect our business. We cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement or interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our future operations or earnings. We also are not able to predict the extent to which new laws and regulations will be adopted or whether such new laws and regulations may impose more stringent or costly restrictions on our operations. 

&#160; 

We depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. This demand is affected by changing taxes, price controls and laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry generally, including those specifically directed to oilfield and offshore operations. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in areas where we operate could also adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services. We cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation or regulations or amendments of existing laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

Our operations and the operations of our customers for whom we provide our products and services are subject to numerous stringent and comprehensive foreign, federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring us or our customers to conduct difficult and costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, modification or cessation of operations, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of new, more stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, could result in additional costs or liabilities upon us or our customers that we cannot currently quantify. 

&#160; 

With regard to our operations in the United States, we generate wastes, including non-hazardous and hazardous wastes, which are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. With authority delegated from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or &#8220;EPA,&#8221; most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or exploration of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA&#8217;s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain of these oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be re-classified as hazardous in the future. For example, in August 2015, several non-governmental organizations filed notice of intent to sue the EPA under RCRA for, among other things, the agency&#8217;s alleged failure to reconsider whether such exclusion should continue to apply. Any such re-classification of these currently exempt wastes to hazardous could subject our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements, which could reduce demand for the products and services we provide and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. 

&#160; 

Also in connection with our operations in the United States, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the "Superfund" law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site where the release occurred and companies that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently have operations in the United States on properties where activities involving the handling of hazardous substances or wastes have been conducted by previous owners or operators whose operations were not under our control. These properties may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws and related regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously discarded hazardous substances and wastes or property contamination that was caused by these third parties. 

&#160; 

In the course of our operations in the United States, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials or "NORM." NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because many of the domestic properties upon which we operate have been used for oil and natural gas production operations for many years, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our operations in the United States are also subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the EPA or applicable state agencies. The EPA released a final rule in May 2015 that attempted to clarify federal jurisdiction under the CWA over waters of the United States, but a number of legal challenges to this rule are pending, and implementation of the rule has been stayed nationwide. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA&#8217;s jurisdiction, we or our customers could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for certain activities in wetland areas. 

&#160; 

Many of the domestic properties upon which we operate require permits for discharges of wastewater and/or storm water, and we have developed a system for securing and maintaining these permits, where required. In addition, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or OPA, imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. A responsible party under OPA includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the OPA, require the development and implementation of spill prevention and response plans and impose potential liability for the remedial costs and associated damages arising out of any unauthorized discharges. 

&#160; 

A certain portion of our completion services business supports other contractors performing hydraulic fracturing to enhance the production of natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shales. While hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated in the United States by state oil and natural gas commissions, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA issued Clean Air Act final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional Clean Air Act regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural-gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural-gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands although, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. In addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the United States and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the lead of the State of New York in 2015. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to use of the hydraulic fracturing process in the United States are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and/or plugging and abandonment, as well as could experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, any or all of which could reduce demand for our completion services business. 

&#160; 

In addition, certain governmental reviews in the United States are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015. That report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not lead to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although it identified above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that EPA&#8217;s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as any future studies, depending on the results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by exploration and production operations, some of which are performed by our customers, and thus reduce demand for our North American completion products and services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In response to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosive incident and resulting oil spill in the United States Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or BSEE, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, or DOI, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory restrictions by offshore exploration, development and production operators, some of whom are our customers, in addition to any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers&#8217; businesses. Moreover, new regulatory initiatives may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM and/or the BSEE in the future that could result in additional delays, restrictions or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore. For example, in April 2015, the BSEE issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, expected to be finalized in 2016, that focuses on well blowout preventer systems and well control with respect to operations on the Outer Continental Shelf. The proposed rule requires, among other things, incorporation of the latest industry standards establishing minimum baseline standards for the design, manufacture, repair, and maintenance of blowout preventers, as well as more controls over the maintenance and repair of blowout preventers. In a second example, in September 2015, the BOEM issued draft guidance that would bolster supplemental bonding procedures for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities. Among other things, this draft guidance proposes to eliminate the &#8220;waiver&#8221; exemption currently allowed by the BOEM with respect to offshore supplemental bonding in favor of a self-insurance mechanism that would allow more operators on the Outer Continental Shelf to seek self-insurance for a portion of their supplemental bonding obligations, but only for an amount that is no more than 10% of such operators&#8217; tangible net worth. The BOEM is expected to issue the draft guidance in the form of a final Notice to Lessees and Operators by no later than early summer 2016. If our customers are unable to obtain the additional required supplemental bonds or other financial assurances as directed by BOEM, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require the operations of those customers on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled. 

&#160; 

These recent or any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives could delay or disrupt our customer&#8217;s operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit activities in certain areas, or cause them to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of their facilities, which developments could reduce demand for our products and services. We may incur penalties directly from BSEE if, based on review of the facts surrounding an alleged violation upon an offshore lease, BSEE elects to hold contractors, including contractors such as us who are involved in well completion operations, potentially liable for alleged violations of law arising in the BSEE&#8217;s jurisdiction area. Also, if material spill events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations or legal initiatives on our customers&#8217; drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. 

&#160; 

Some of our operations as well as those of our oil and natural gas customers in the U.S. also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, or CAA, and analogous state laws require permits for facilities in the United States that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties. In addition, amendment of the CAA or comparable state laws may cause our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers to incur capital expenditures for installation of air pollution control equipment and to encounter construction delays while applying for and receiving new or amended permits, which could have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. Certain areas of the country currently in compliance with the ground-level ozone NAAQS standard may be reclassified as non-attainment and such reclassification may make it more difficult for us or our exploration, development and production customers to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Moreover, states are expected to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our or our customers&#8217; operations. Compliance with this final rule could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers&#8217; equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers&#8217; capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our and our customers&#8217; businesses. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Past scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, or GHG, and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In 2010, Canada affirmed its desire to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord that was negotiated in December 2009 as part of the international meetings on climate change regulation in Copenhagen. The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, allows countries to commit to specific efforts to reduce GHG emissions, although how and when the commitments may be converted into binding emission reduction obligations is currently uncertain. Pursuant to the Copenhagen Accord process, Canada has indicated an economy-wide GHG emissions target that equates to a 17 per cent reduction from 2005 levels by 2020, and the Canadian federal government has also indicated objectives of reducing overall Canadian GHG emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 and by 60% to 70% from 2006 levels by 2050. One measure the government of Canada has undertaken in pursuit of this objective is to regulate GHG emissions on a sector by sector basis. The oil and gas sector has yet to be subject to specific emission targets at the federal level although, in May 2015, the federal government announced its intention to develop new regulatory measures for the oil, gas and chemical industries. However, as discussed below, such emissions targets are being proposed in Alberta. If and to the extent such specific emission targets are established, the costs of complying with such emission targets may adversely affect our and our clients&#39; levels of activity in the energy sector and our respective financial results. 

&#160; 

Additionally, GHG regulation can take place at the provincial and municipal level. For example, Alberta introduced the Climate Change and Emissions Management Act, which provides a framework for managing GHG emissions by reducing specified gas emissions, relative to gross domestic product, to an amount that is equal to or less than 50% of 1990 levels by December 31, 2020. The accompanying regulation, the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, effective July 1, 2007, requires mandatory emissions reductions through the use of emissions intensity targets, and a company can meet the applicable emissions limits by making emissions intensity improvements at facilities, offsetting GHG emissions by purchasing offset credits or emission performance credits in the open market, or acquiring &#8220;fund credits&#8221; by making payments of $15 per ton of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions to the Alberta Climate Change and Management Fund. The Specified Gas Reporting Regulation imposes GHG emissions reporting requirements if certain established facilities have GHG emissions of 100,000 tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent in a calendar year. However, in November 2015, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley announced that the province will transition from the current approach to an oil sands-based performance standard for carbon pricing and will legislate an overall limit to oil sands GHG emissions. In particular, Alberta will implement a $20 per ton carbon tax in January 2017 that will increase to $30 per ton carbon tax in January 2018 that will be applied to oil sands facilities emitting GHGs as a means of reducing GHG emissions. Moreover, Alberta plans to restrict GHG emissions from oil sands operations by introducing an emissions limit of 100 megatons of carbon per year; data reported by the Alberta government indicates that oil sands operations currently generate approximately 70 megatons of carbon a year. In addition, Alberta facilities must currently report emissions of industrial air pollutants and comply with obligations in permits and under other environmental regulations. The Canadian federal government currently proposes to enter into equivalency agreements with provinces to establish a consistent regulatory regime for GHGs, but the success of any such plan is uncertain, possibly leaving overlapping levels of regulation. The direct and indirect costs of overlapping regulations may adversely affect our operations and financial results as well as those of our customers with whom we conduct business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In the United States, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and, based on those findings, adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards that typically will be established by the states. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our and our exploration, development and production customers&#8217; operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources that are major sources of GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including, among others, offshore and onshore oil and natural gas production facilities. 

&#160; 

While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the U.S., a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. If Congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year, it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax, which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas, which could reduce the demand for our products and services. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in August 2015, the EPA proposed rules that will establish emission standards for methane from certain new and modified oil and natural-gas production and natural-gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Obama Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural-gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA&#8217;s proposed rule package includes standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically-fractured oil and natural-gas well completions, fugitive emissions from well sites and compressors, and equipment leaks at natural-gas processing plants and pneumatic pumps. The EPA is expected to finalize these rules in 2016. In addition, on an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations (including Canada) that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended, or the ESA, restricts activities in the United States that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas of the United States where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, such operations could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or FWS, is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before the end of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. For example, in March 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma, as a threatened species under the ESA. However, on September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas vacated the FWS&#8217; rule listing the lesser prairie chicken in its entirety, concluding that the decision to list the species was arbitrary and capricious. It remains to be seen how the FWS responds to the vacating of its rule. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of the United States where our customers&#8217; oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 

&#160; 

Our operations outside of the United States are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls relating to protection of the environment. We believe that, to date, our operations outside of the United States have been in substantial compliance with existing requirements of these foreign governmental bodies and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our operations. However, this trend of compliance with existing requirements may not continue in the future or the cost of such compliance may become material. For instance, any future restrictions on emissions of GHGs that are imposed in foreign countries in which we operate, could adversely affect demand for our services. 

&#160; 

In addition, some of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act and general maritime law. These laws operate to make the liability limits established under states&#39; workers&#39; compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives generally to pursue actions against us for damages or job-related injuries with no limitations on our potential liability. 

&#160;
