 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, including its wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Lixte Biotechnology, Inc. (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company&#8217;s product pipeline encompasses two major categories of compounds at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development that the Company believes have broad therapeutic potential not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described below. The Company has not yet commenced any sustainable revenue-generating operations, does not have any positive cash flows from operations, and is dependent on equity capital to fund its operating requirements. 

&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary focus is developing new treatments for human cancers for which better therapies are urgently needed. The scope of potential applications of the Company&#8217;s products has expanded to other common non-malignant diseases, including vascular diseases (heart attacks and stroke, diabetes, genetic diseases, such as Gaucher&#8217;s disease), and recently to depression and potentially post-traumatic stress syndrome. This has occurred because the targets selected by the Company have multiple functions in the cell, which, when altered, result in different disorders that may benefit by treatment from the Company&#8217;s products. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s drug discovery process is based on discerning clues to potential new targets for disease treatments reported in the increasingly large body of literature identifying the molecular variants which characterize human cancers and other non-cancer disorders. The Company designs drugs for which there are existing data suggesting that they may affect the altered pathways of the cancer cell and may be given safely to humans. The Company seeks to rapidly arrive at patentable structures through analysis of the literature rather than screening of thousands of structures for activity against a particular biochemical pathway. 

&#160; 

This approach has led to the development of two classes of drugs for the treatment of cancer, consisting of protein phosphatase inhibitors (PTase-i), designated by the Company as the LB-100 series of compounds, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), designated by the Company as the LB-200 series of compounds. Compounds of both types also have potential use in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 

&#160; 

The LB-100 series consists of novel structures, which have the potential to be first in their class, and may be useful in the treatment of not only several types of cancer but also vascular and metabolic diseases. The LB-200 series contains compounds which have the potential to be the most effective in its class and may be useful for the treatment of chronic hereditary diseases, such as Gaucher&#8217;s disease, in addition to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. 

&#160; 

The Company has demonstrated that lead compounds of both series of drugs are active against a broad spectrum of human cancers in cell culture and against several types of human cancers in animal models. The research on new drug treatment was initiated in 2006 with the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (&#8220;NINDS&#8221;), National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;) under a continuing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (&#8220;CRADA&#8221;) effective March 22, 2006. The research at NINDS was led by Dr. Zhengping Zhuang, an internationally recognized investigator in the molecular pathology of cancer. The initial focus of the CRADA was on the most common and uniformly fatal brain tumor of adults, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The work at NIH was then extended to the most common brain tumor of children, medulloblastoma, and to the most common extracranial solid tumor of children, neuroblastoma. The CRADA was extended through a series of amendments and remained in effect until April 1, 2013, when it terminated as scheduled. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Effective treatment of brain tumors depends upon the ability of compounds to penetrate a physiological barrier known as the &#8220;blood-brain barrier&#8221;, which protects the brain from exposure to potentially toxic substances in the blood. Because there is no certainty that the Company&#8217;s compounds will be active against tumors confined to the brain, the LB-100 compounds have been studied against a variety of common and rare cancer types and have been shown to potentiate the activity of standard anti-cancer drugs in animal models of breast and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, pheochromcytomas and sarcomas. Because the LB-100 compounds appear to exert their ability to improve the effectiveness of different forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy by inhibiting a process upon which most, if not all, cancer cell types depend on to survive treatment, the Company believes the LB-100 series of compounds may be useful against most, if not all, cancer types. 

&#160; 

The second class of drugs under development by the Company, the LB-200 series, is the histone deacetylase inhibitors. Many pharmaceutical companies are also developing drugs of this type, and at least two companies have HDACi approved for clinical use, in both cases for the treatment of a type of lymphoma. Despite this significant competition, the Company has demonstrated that its HDACi have broad activity against many cancer types, have neuroprotective activity, and have anti-fungal activity. In addition, these compounds have low toxicity, making them attractive candidates for development. It appears that one type of molecule has diverse effects, affecting biochemical processes that are fundamental to the life of the cell, whether they are cancer cells, nerve cells, or even fungal cells. The neuroprotective activity of the Company&#8217;s HDACi has been demonstrated in the test tube in model systems that mimic injury to brain cells such as occurs in stroke and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Potentially, this type of protective activity may have application to a broad spectrum of other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson&#8217;s Disease and Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease). 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary objective has been to bring one lead compound of the LB-100 series to clinical trial. In 2012, the Company completed the pre-clinical studies needed to prepare an Investigation New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, and engaged Theradex Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Theradex&#8221;), an international contract research organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) that provides professional services for the clinical research and development of pharmaceutical compounds, to be responsible for the clinical development of the Company&#8217;s lead compound, LB-100, to prepare an IND application for filing with the FDA. 

&#160; 

The Company filed an IND application with the FDA on April 30, 2012, and on July 24, 2012, the FDA notified the Company that it would allow initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The purpose of this clinical trial was to demonstrate that LB-100 can be administered safely to human beings at a dose and at a frequency that achieves the desired pharmacologic effect; in this case, inhibition of a specific enzyme, without being associated with toxicities considered unacceptable. The Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 was designed to be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the maximum tolerable dose (&#8220;MTD&#8221;) of LB-100 was to be determined. In Part 2, the MTD of LB-100, in combination with the standard cytotoxic drug docetaxel (which is a well-established anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of various cancers), was to be determined. 

&#160; 

The Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 began in April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial initiated at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, and was extended in December 2013 to include the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, both of which are Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. As the accrual of patients was slower than anticipated, in October 2014, the Company entered into a Clinical Research Agreement (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) with US Oncology Research, LLC, a large community-based research network based in Texas, to increase the rate of entry of patients into the clinical trial by adding four more active clinical oncologic research sites. 

&#160; 

The costs of Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial have exceeded the Company&#8217;s original estimates, in part because patients were able to tolerate higher doses of LB-100 than originally expected, thus requiring more dose escalation steps to determine the MTD of LB-100 given alone. In addition, patients have been achieving stabilization without any dose-limiting toxicity (&#8220;DLT&#8221;), remaining on treatment with LB-100 for longer periods of time than is usual in a Phase 1 clinical trial of a new drug in patients failing all previous treatments. The Company&#8217;s interpretation of the clinical trial results to date is that LB-100 as a single agent has activity against several types of cancer, as evidenced by stabilization of progressive disease in the absence of DLT. The Company is continuing to administer LB-100 to patients if there is no cancer progression and the patient feels well and has no significant toxicity. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company had planned to proceed with Part 2 of the Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the toxicity of LB-100 in combination with docetaxel against a specific solid tumor for which single agent docetaxel is indicated. However, two developments have altered this plan. LB-100 appears to have anti-cancer activity in its own right, and second, preclinical studies indicate that LB-100 in combination with cisplatin (a widely used cytotoxic drug) is more active than LB-100 in combination with docetaxel. LB-100 significantly potentiates the standard anti-cancer drug cisplatin in animal models of several tumor types, including hepatocellular cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In addition, it has been reported that inhibition of the enzyme-target of LB-100, PP2A, inhibits certain variants of the hematologic disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome (&#8220;MDS&#8221;). Accordingly, the Company has decided not to proceed with Part 2 of the Phase 1 clinical trial, and has initiated planning for Phase 1b/2 clinical trials in 2016 to evaluate the effectiveness of LB-100 alone for the treatment of MDS and in combination with a platinum compound for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. 

&#160; 

The Company estimates that Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 will now cost a total of approximately $2,200,000 and will be completed by May 31, 2016, as compared to the Company&#8217;s previous estimate of a total cost of approximately $1,800,000 and a completion date of December 31, 2015. The following factors have contributed to the most recent revisions to the total cost and completion date of this clinical trial: (1) some patients are continuing to receive the study compound longer than is usual for patients with treatment-refractory progressive disease in a Phase 1 clinical trial; (2) the establishment of the MTD required more subjects than the initially planned six patients; and (3) the planned pharmacokinetic studies required more than the initially planned three patients. 

&#160; 

The costs of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 are being paid to or through Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development of LB-100. Total costs charged to operations through December 31, 2015 for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $1,660,725, of which $958,896 and $423,108 were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 46% and 38% of research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Publications 

&#160; 

The following publications have included articles discussing the Company&#8217;s compounds: 

&#160; 

An article in the December 12, 2011edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States reported that the Company&#8217;s investigational drug, LB-205 was shown to have therapeutic potential in a laboratory model of the genetic illness Gaucher&#8217;s disease. The Company has patent applications pending on the use of LB-205 for this purpose. 

&#160; 

On June 18, 2013, an article was published in Clinical Cancer Research showing that LB-100 is a radiotherapy sensitizing agent that increases the effectiveness of x-ray treatment against human pancreatic cancer cells in an animal model, as the Company has shown for two other types of human cancers. These results are in keeping with the ability of LB-100 to enhance the effectiveness of existing cytotoxic treatments, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, against different types of cancers. Because LB-100 itself does not readily enter the brain in animal models, the Company has developed new related compounds which have been shown to penetrate the blood brain barrier (entering the brain after systemic injection) in mice, and is evaluating the effectiveness of these compounds in the treatment of brain tumors in animal models. 

&#160; 

The June 25, 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that scientists at the National Institutes of Health had determined that one of the Company&#8217;s 200 series compounds significantly reduced the extent of structural damage in the brain and lessened neurological functional impairment in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Given the need for methods to reduce injury to the brain after acute injuries caused by explosive devices, sports injuries and accidental falls, the Company is seeking partners in the private and governmental sectors to assist in developing these compounds for clinical evaluation. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In May 2014 an article was published in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics reporting that LB-100 enhanced the therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin) without significantly enhancing toxicity against hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in animal models. HCC is the most common cancer in Asia and one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, investigators reported in Cancer Letters that LB-100 enhanced the therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy in animal models of pancreatic cancer can without significantly enhancing toxicity. 

&#160; 

In November 2014, investigators from the National Institutes of Health reported in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics that LB-100 overcomes the resistance of cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity of animals. This finding is of particular interest as platinum-based chemotherapy drugs are the first-line treatment for women with unresectable ovarian cancer and patients so treated eventually relapse because of development of platinum-resistant disease. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, scientists from the Terry Fox Cancer Center, Vancouver, British Columbia, reported at the Annual Society of Hematology Meeting that LB-100 is active alone and potentiates the activity of Imatinib (Gleevec) against human cell lines of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), both imatinib-na&#239;ve CML cells and Imatinib-resistant CML cells. Although virtually all patients with CML worldwide receive Imatinib as initial therapy and most patients have an excellent response, almost every patient relapses because of development of Imatinib&#8211;resistance. 

&#160; 

On November 6, 2015, it was reported at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, Boston, Massachusetts, that in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, LB-100 was associated with stabilization of a variety of advanced cancers that had been progressing despite extensive prior treatment without dose-limiting toxicity. The authors reporting this development were Vincent Chung, City of Hope, Duarte, California; Donald Richard, Texas Oncology, Tyler, Texas; Fadi Braiteh, Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada; John S. Kovach, Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. East Setauket, New York; and Aaron Scott Mansfield, May Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 

&#160; 

On January 25, 2016, in the journal Nature Medicine, neuroscientists at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) using a mouse model of depression identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a potential pharmacological target for therapy. Administration of LB-100, the Company&#8217;s proprietary inhibitor of PP2A, rapidly reduced depressive-like symptoms in these conditioned animals. 

&#160;

The Market 

&#160; 

Anti-Cancer Drugs 

&#160; 

The Company has developed two series of pharmacologically active drugs, the LB-100 series and the LB-200 series. The Company believes that the mechanism by which compounds of the LB-100 series affect cancer cell growth is different from cancer agents currently approved for clinical use. Lead compounds from each series have activity against a broad spectrum of common and rarer human cancers in cell culture systems. In addition, compounds from both series have anti-cancer activity in animal models of glioblastoma multiforme, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma, all cancers of neural tissue. Lead compounds of the LB-100 series also have activity against melanoma, breast cancer and sarcoma in animal models and enhance the effectiveness of commonly used anti-cancer drugs in these model systems. The enhancement of anti-cancer activity of these anti-cancer drugs occurs at doses of LB-100 that do not significantly increase toxicity in animals. It is therefore hoped that when combined with standard anti-cancer regimens against many tumor types, the Company&#8217;s compounds will improve therapeutic benefit without enhancing toxicity in humans. 

&#160; 

Marketing Plan 

&#160; 

The primary goal of the Company is to take LB-100 through Phase 1 clinical trials. Because of the novelty and spectrum of activity of LB-100, the Company believes it is reasonably likely it will find a partner in the pharmaceutical industry with interest in this compound at some stage of its clinical development. However, the Company would prefer to delay the partnering/licensing decision until the potential value of its products is augmented by demonstrating there is no impediment to clinical evaluation and a therapeutic dose level is determined in clinical trials. Demonstration of clinical usefulness would be expected to substantially increase the value of the Company&#8217;s product. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Further development of lead compounds from each of the LB-100 and LB-200 series requires pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characterization (i.e., how long a drug persists in the blood and how long the drug is active at the intended target) and large animal toxicologic evaluation under conditions meeting FDA requirements. Most anti-cancer drugs fail in development because of unacceptable toxicity. However, by analogy with mechanistically related compounds, there is good reason to believe that lead compounds of both series of drugs will be able to be given to humans safely by routes and at doses resulting in concentration of drug producing anti-cancer activity in animal model systems. The Company has demonstrated that lead compounds of both types affect their intended targets at doses that produce anti-cancer activity without discernable toxicity in animal models. 

&#160; 

One of the Company&#8217;s most valuable resources is its scientific team, a coalition of various experts brought together through contracts and other collaborative arrangements. The team has expertise in cancer biology, proteomics (cancer biomarkers), medicinal and synthetic chemistry, pharmacology, clinical oncology and drug evaluation. In a short period of time and at very low cost, this group has developed lead compounds of two different classes of drugs that are positioned for development as new treatments for several types of cancer. The initial cancer targets are expected to be melanoma or glioblastoma multiforme. 

&#160; 

Product Overview 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products will derive directly from its intellectual property, consisting of patents and applications for patents. The Company&#8217;s patents currently cover sole rights to the composition and synthesis of the LB-100 and LB-200 series of drugs. Joint patent applications with NIH have been filed for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, and neuroblastoma. The Company has also filed claims for the use of certain homologs of both series of drugs for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease and Parkinson&#8217;s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease), stroke and traumatic brain injury, and of homologs of the LB-200 series for the potential treatment of serious systemic fungal infections and common fungal infections of the skin and nails. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company believes that there are four main markets for potential products that it may develop. 

&#160; 

1. Improved Anti-Cancer Treatments . The primary focus of the Company is improved chemotherapy regimens for cancers not curable by surgery or radiation. 

&#160; 

2. Treatments for Neurodegenerative Diseases . Most experts believe that at present there are no significantly effective drugs available for the delay of progression, as well as prevention, of the common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, Parkinson&#8217;s Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disease (ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease), among a host of rarer chronic diseases of the brain. The Company is exploring mechanisms to evaluate its compounds for these activities with experts in the field, in academic and in other not-for&#8211;profit settings. 

&#160; 

3. Treatments for Vascular Diseases . Non-patentable compounds which reduce the extent of tissue damage after experimental induction of myocardial ischemia in animal models affect the same enzyme targeted by the Company&#8217;s LB-100 compound, raising the possibility that these agents may have therapeutic benefit in heart attacks and potentially in strokes due to acute blood vessel blockage. 

&#160; 

4. Treatments for Fungal Infections of the Skin . LB-200 compounds have activity against the most common fungal infections of humans and animals in cell culture and animal models. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to FDA regulations as it conducts clinical trials. Additionally, any product for which the Company obtains marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with the Company&#8217;s products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturer or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recall, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. The Company&#8217;s present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, as well as specialized biotechnology and life sciences firms in the United States and in other countries. Most of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company does. Additionally, mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in the Company&#8217;s competitors. The Company&#8217;s existing or prospective competitors may develop processes or products that are more effective than the Company&#8217;s or be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products faster. The Company&#8217;s competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or receiving regulatory approval for commercializing products before the Company does. Developments by the Company&#8217;s competitors may render the Company&#8217;s product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. 

&#160; 

The Company also experiences competition from universities and other research institutions, and the Company is likely to compete with others in acquiring technology from those sources. There can be no assurance that other organizations will not develop technologies with significant advantages over those that the Company is seeking to develop. Any such development could harm the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

The Company competes with universities and other research institutions engaged in research in these areas. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors have greater technical and financial resources than the Company does.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully is based on numerous factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the cost-effectiveness of any product that the Company ultimately commercializes relative to competing products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the ease of use and ready availability of any product that the Company brings to market; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the relative speed with which the Company is able to bring any product resulting from its research to market in its target markets. &#160; 

If the Company is unable to distinguish its products from competing products, or if competing products reach the market first, the Company may be unable to compete successfully with current or future competitors.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had no full-time employees. Dr. Kovach is a Professor (part-time) in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the State University of New York at Stony Brook (&#8220;SUNY &#8211; Stony Brook&#8221;) in Stony Brook, New York. He received approvals from SUNY &#8211; Stony Brook and from the New York State Ethics Commission to manage the operations of the Company and to hold greater than 5% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of common stock. 

&#160; 

Dr. Kovach devotes approximately 50% of his efforts per year to the Company, including research planning and management functions. Dr. Kovach&#8217;s contributions to the Company are made outside of his academic responsibilities at SUNY &#8211; Stony Brook. He directs, coordinates and manages the scientific and business development of the Company with the advice of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, the Scientific Advisory Committee, and, from time to time, various consultants with specific expertise. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Studies done under the CRADA were carried out in compliance with applicable Statutes, Executive Capital Orders, HHS regulations and all FDA, CDC, and NIH policies as specified in Article 13, 13.1 and 13.2, of the PHS CRADA agreement. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business is subject to the regulations of the FDA as it conducts clinical trials. Clinical trials are research studies to answer specific questions about new therapies or new ways of using known treatments. Clinical trials determine whether new drugs or treatments are both safe and effective and the FDA has determined that carefully conducted clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that work in people. 

&#160; 

The first phase of clinical trials, Phase 1 trials, are the initial studies to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic action of drugs in humans and side effects associated with increasing doses, and to gain early evidence of effectiveness. Patients entering such trials are those for whom no means of therapy is known to be associated with benefit. Such studies, including a proposal for the conduct of the clinical trial, require approval by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The FDA also requires that an independent review body consider the benefits and risks of a clinical trial and grant approval for the proposed study including selecting of initial doses, plans for escalation of dose, plans for modification of dose if toxicity is encountered, plans for monitoring the wellbeing of individuals participating in the study, and for defining and measuring, to the extent possible, any untoward effects related to drug administration. Serious adverse effects, such as life-threatening toxicities and death, are immediately reportable to the review body and to the FDA. To minimize risk when studying a new drug, the initial dose is well below that expected to cause any toxicity. No more than three patients are entered at a given dose. In general, dose is not escalated within patients. Once safety is established by the absence of toxicity or low toxicity in a group of three patients, a planned higher dose is then evaluated in a subsequent group of three individuals and so on until dose-limiting toxicity is encountered. The dose level producing definite but acceptable toxicity is then selected as the dose level to be evaluated in Phase 2 trials. Thus, the goal of Phase 1 studies is to determine the appropriate dose level for evaluation of drug efficacy in patients with the same type of tumor at comparable stages of progression for which no beneficial treatment is established.

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition to regulations imposed by the FDA, depending on the Company&#8217;s future activities, the Company may become subject to regulation under various federal and state statutes and regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Research Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, and import, export and customs regulations. From time to time, other federal agencies and congressional committees have indicated an interest in implementing further regulation of biotechnology applications. The Company is not able to predict whether any such regulations will be adopted or whether, if adopted, such regulations will apply to the Company&#8217;s business, or whether the Company or its collaborators would be able to comply with any applicable regulations. 

&#160; 

In addition, as the Company intends to market its products in international markets, the Company may be required to obtain separate regulatory approvals from the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The Company may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize its products in any market.
