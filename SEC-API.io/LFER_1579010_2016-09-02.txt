 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

&#160;

Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;HISP&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated on April 15, 2013 as a Delaware company and is engaged in the distribution of proprietary, licensed and third party Hispanic and ethnic food and beverages throughout the United States. HISP has already begun to distribute fruit juices, nectars, and milk based products and expects begin to distribute teas, carbonated drinks, dry goods, preserves, frozen foods and bakery products. The brands distributed are under a proprietary basis (through distribution agreements and/or exclusive licensing arrangements). Our brands emulate the flavors, tastes, and traditions which have been known for generations among the Hispanic and other ethnic groups and are now becoming part of the American mainstream diet. 

&#160;

Our objective is to grow as rapidly as possible (both organically and via strategic alliances and acquisitions) using the public capital markets for access to capital. The companies and assets sought by us will be those that already have market penetration in the following segments: (1) Food Distribution and Manufacturing; (2) Beverage Brands and (3) Distribution Food Service.

&#160;

HISP exclusively distributes about $200,000 in GRAN NEVADA (GN) products, and our objective is to grow the GN business to over $1 million per year. Our management team has over 30 years of combined experience in the Hispanic food and beverage industry to generate these sales. In July 2016, we acquired the company&#8217;s first Direct Store Delivery (&#8220;DSD&#8221;) in an all cash purchase. HISP has new key personnel with previous managerial experience to begin the implementation of increasing our sales to potentially growing the business with a target of $5MM in revenues with plans to continue its growth via mergers and acquisitions.

In October 2013 we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. (&#8220;Gran Nevada&#8221;), an entity related through common management. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in Texas and California with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated. We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014.

&#160;

On October 30, 2015, the company entered into an agreement to acquire a 20% minority equity interest in Just Buns Inc. in exchange for 20,000 shares to the Company&#146;s common stock. The Company also entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with Just Buns, Inc. to distribute their proprietary Ensaimades sold under the name &#147;Swirly Buns&#148;. As of the date of this filing the Company has not finalized these transactions. Upon finalization the Company will issue 20,000 shares of common stock.

&#160;

On March 24, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. (&#8220;ESD&#8221;) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective July 5, 2016, we entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;) with TCA Global Credit Master fund, L.P. (&#8220;TCA&#8221;) which allows the Company to borrow up to $7.5 million. However, as of the execution date of the Credit Facility, only $1.6 million has been allocated by TCA to the Company for working capital financing and for any other purpose permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. ESD is Corporate Guarantor to the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we are obligated to pay approximately $544,000 of transaction fees to TCA including a Transaction Advisory Fee equal to 2% of the loan commitment amount, as defined by the Credit Facility, and an Advisory Fee of $350,000 which may be paid in restricted stock or cash. On July 5, 2016 the Company borrowed $650,000 from the Credit Facility and used the proceeds to complete the acquisition of ESD; payoff outstanding secured obligations; to pay vendors for inventory purchases transaction and closing fee to TCA.

&#160;

&#160;

CURRENT OPERATIONS 

&#160;

Sales 

&#160;

We currently market and sell traditional Hispanic beverages as well as nationally recognized branded beverages through ESD. We plan to market and sell more traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands and distributors of Hispanic products. Brands sought by us are primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as all natural food products that target toward Hispanic and ethnic-neutral consumers.

&#160;

Production and Distribution 

We buy pre-packaged and unpackaged goods for distribution through various channels. We began distributing the beverage products of Gran Nevada in the third fiscal quarter of 2014. Gran Nevada is the sole manufacturer for its product line, and there are no alternate suppliers in the event that Gran Nevada or its suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide us with the products needed to meet demand. We use an unrelated third party to package our products for distribution.

&#160;

As of May 2016, Gran Nevada had eight (8) SKUs that are manufactured in North America. Gran Nevada intends to expand to 13 SKUs by adding five new product lines of popular existing flavors in larger formats. We currently sell 70% of Gran Nevada products through distributors to grocery stores, which want larger containers for home consumption and food service markets rather than just the current eight single serve products. We will package, in Q4 2017, the Gran Nevada Horchata de Morro and Mexican Horchata in 1 liter Tetra Pack cartons, Tamarind, Mango &#38; Guava flavors in 64oz PET containers.. The Gran Nevada products distributed are all natural, not from concentrate, preservative-free Aguas Frescas (Mexican Horchata, Horchata de Morro, Tamarindo, Hibiscus, Mango, Guava, Pineapple, and Limeade). These products are geared towards the Hispanic market, but may appeal to almost any palate. An important part of our overall strategy will be expansion through the acquisition of distributors.

&#160;

We sell the Gran Nevada products through several distributors and we regularly seek to broaden our distribution channels. We have engaged third party sales and marketing brokers in many areas of the country. We also now sell directly to retailers through ESD, including large chain stores. Direct to retail enables manufacturers to offer better prices to retailers, which results in higher gross margins for retailers.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We are in the process of securing a trademark for our name and logo. As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any trademarks or copyrights for our intellectual property.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

As a distributor of Hispanic and ethnic packaged food products, we expect to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages. Our main competitors include Goya Foods, Marquez Brothers International, Diaz Foods, La Fe Foods International, Grace Foods, as well as other regional Ethnic Food Distributors. We will focus on selecting brands of all natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling and distributing similar products, they use different packaging options and in particular market foods that have high contents of artificial flavors, colors, and sweeteners as well high sodium contents. Additionally, our competitors import the majority of their distributed products, which are made with lower quality and price point raw materials. We will focus on distributing all natural products as well as obtaining exclusive rights to brands that can be manufactured closer to its U.S. market base. We are committed to building long-term relationships with our consumers by offering superior, high quality products at the most competitive prices.

&#160;

The packaged beverage market is highly competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel, distribution and product shelf space. As a developing company, a majority of our competitors are more established and better capitalized. The packaged beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers, including The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, Inc. Many of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products. Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels and retailers through which we sell our products. We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Packaged beverage and juice products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for us to ensure that we establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet legal food labeling requirements. Our products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including food facility registration, recordkeeping, good manufacturing practice requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer, President, and our Chief Operating Officer were our sole employees. Other executive and management positions are being filled by paid independent contractors or our directors who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. We mitigate the need for a production staff by purchasing finished inventory. We have contracted with food brokers to represent Gran Nevada to retail stores nationally. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. We also outsource our logistics to third-parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

The Company is an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221;, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Stamps Act of 2012 (&#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

&#160;

The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

&#160;

We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company: until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.

&#160;

To the extent that we continue to qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirements to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.

&#160;

Going Concern Qualification 

&#160; 

Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $400,207 and $212,593 for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company&#8217;s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities.

&#160;

At May 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $27,241, and an accumulated deficit of $ 814,549. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221;
