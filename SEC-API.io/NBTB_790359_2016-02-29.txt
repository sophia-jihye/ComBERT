 ITEM 1. Business 

&#160;

NBT Bancorp Inc. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") is a registered financial holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1986, with its principal headquarters located in Norwich, New York. The Company, on a consolidated basis, at December 31, 2015 had assets of $8.3 billion and stockholders' equity of $882.0 million. 

&#160;

The principal assets of the Registrant consist of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiaries, including: NBT Bank, National Association (the "Bank"), NBT Financial Services, Inc. ("NBT Financial"), NBT Holdings, Inc. ("NBT Holdings"), Hathaway Agency, Inc., and CNBF Capital Trust I, NBT Statutory Trust I and NBT Statutory Trust II (collectively, the "Trusts"). The Company's principal sources of revenue are the management fees and dividends it receives from the Bank, NBT Financial and NBT Holdings.

&#160;

The Company's business, primarily conducted through the Bank but also through its other subsidiaries, consists of providing commercial banking and financial services to customers in its market area, which includes central and upstate New York, northeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, Vermont, and the greater Portland, Maine area. The Company has been, and intends to continue to be, a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services. The Company's business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision-making, principally in non-metropolitan markets, providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail, commercial, and municipal customers. The financial condition and operating results of the Company are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on its earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the interest expense paid on its interest bearing liabilities, primarily consisting of deposits and borrowings. Among other factors, net income is also affected by provisions for loan losses and noninterest income, such as service charges on deposit accounts, insurance and other financial services fees, trust revenue, and gains/losses on securities sales, bank owned life insurance income, ATM and debit card fees, and retirement plan administration fees as well as noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and communications, professional fees and outside services, office supplies and postage, amortization, loan collection and other real estate owned expenses, advertising, FDIC expenses, and other expenses.

&#160;

Substantially all of the Company's business activities are with customers located in the United States. Percentage of revenue and loan composition by state is summarized below:

Like much of the nation, the market areas that the Company serves are still experiencing economic challenges and volatility. A variety of factors (e.g., any substantial rise in inflation or rise in unemployment rates, decrease in consumer confidence, adverse international economic conditions, natural disasters, war, or political instability) may affect both the Company's markets and the national market. The Company will continue to emphasize managing its funding costs and lending and investment rates to effectively maintain profitability. In addition, the Company will continue to seek and maintain relationships that can generate noninterest income. We anticipate that this approach should help mitigate profit fluctuations that are caused by movements in interest rates, business and consumer loan cycles, and local economic factors.

The Trusts

The Trusts were organized to raise additional regulatory capital and to provide funding for certain acquisitions. CNBF Capital Trust I ("Trust I") and NBT Statutory Trust I are Delaware statutory business trusts formed in 1999 and 2005, respectively, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company. In connection with the acquisition of CNB Bancorp, Inc., the Company formed NBT Statutory Trust II ("Trust II") in February 2006 to fund the cash portion of the acquisition as well as to provide regulatory capital. The Company raised $51.5 million through Trust II in February 2006. The Company guarantees, on a limited basis, payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities. The Trusts are variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("FASB ASC"). In accordance with FASB ASC, the accounts of the Trusts are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Competition

The financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial products and services in our market area. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of the continued low rate environment, changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions, and other nonbank financial service providers.

The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.

Some of the Company's nonbanking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Company, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Company. These institutions may have the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may also be able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than the Company can offer. Some of these institutions offer services, such as credit cards and international banking, which the Company does not directly offer.

Various in-state market competitors and out-of-state banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter or expand their presence in the market areas in which the Company currently operates. With the addition of new banking presences within our market, the Company expects increased competition for loans, deposits, and other financial products and services.

In order to compete with other financial services providers, the Company stresses the community nature of its banking operations and principally relies upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by officers, directors, and employees with their customers, and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. We also offer certain customer services, such as agricultural lending, that many of our larger competitors do not offer. While the Company's position varies by market, the Company's management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making, and awareness of customer needs.

The table below summarizes the Bank's deposits and market share by the thirty-eight counties of New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Maine in which it had customer facilities as of June 30, 2015. Market share is based on deposits of all commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loans associations, and savings banks.

Supervision and Regulation

The Company, the Bank and certain of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, and the stability of the U.S. banking system. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies, such as the Company. Statutes, regulations and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state agencies. A change in any statute, regulation or policy applicable to the Company may have a material effect on the results of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Overview

The Company is a registered bank holding company and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "BHC Act"), as amended, and is subject to the supervision of and regular examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board" or "FRB") as its primary federal regulator. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. The Company is traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol, " NBTB ," and is subject to the NASDAQ stock market rules.

The Bank is organized as a national banking association under the National Bank Act. The Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") as its chartering authority and primary federal regulator. The Bank is also subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") as its deposit insurer. Financial products and services offered by the Company and the Bank are subject to federal consumer protection laws and implementing regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). The Company and the Bank are also subject to oversight by state attorneys general for compliance with state consumer protection laws. The Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. The non-bank subsidiaries of the Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the FRB and the OCC, respectively.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") has significantly changed the financial regulatory landscape in the U.S. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the federal banking agencies. As a result, management cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or the extent to which it could affect operations of the Company and the Bank.

Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company.

Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a bank holding company as defined by the BHCA. The BHCA generally limits the business of the Company to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking "as to be a proper incident thereto." The Company has also qualified for and elected to be a financial holding company. Financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system (as solely determined by the FRB). If a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities permitted under the BHC Act for financial holding companies, (i) the bank holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be "well capitalized" and "well managed," as defined in the FRB's Regulation Y, and (ii) it must file a declaration with the FRB that it elects to be a "financial holding company." In order for a financial holding company to commence any activity that is financial in nature, incidental thereto, or complementary to a financial activity, or to acquire a company engaged in any such activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least "satisfactory" in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA"). See the section titled "Community Reinvestment Act of 1977" for further information relating to the CRA.

Regulation of Mergers and Acquisitions

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of depository institutions and their holding companies. The BHC Act requires prior FRB approval for the direct or indirect acquisition of 5% or more of the voting shares of a bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, prior approval of the OCC is required for a national bank to merge with another bank where the national bank is the resulting bank or to purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other criteria, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banking organization, the applicant's performance record under the CRA, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.

As a financial holding company, the Company is permitted to acquire control of non-depository institution companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are incidental and complementary to financial activities without prior FRB approval. However, the BHC Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, requires prior written approval from the FRB or prior written notice to the FRB before a financial holding company may acquire control of a company with consolidated assets of $10 billion or more.

Capital Contributions

The principal source of the Company's liquidity is dividends from the Bank. The OCC oversees the ability of the Bank to make capital contributions, including dividends. The OCC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, based on the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment.

The OCC's prior approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank's net income for that year and its undistributed net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. The National Bank Act also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank's undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank's allowance for loan and lease losses.

Affiliate and Insider Transactions

Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the Company, are governed by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the "FRA") and the FRB's implementing Regulation W. An "affiliate" of a bank includes any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Bank. Generally, sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses in transactions with affiliates. These sections place quantitative and qualitative limitations on covered transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, and require that all transactions between a bank and its affiliates occur on market terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders ("Insiders"). Under Section 22(h), loans to Insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution's total capital and surplus. Loans to Insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Bank's board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the Bank's employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers.

Federal Deposit Insurance and Brokered Deposits

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor per insured institution. The Bank's deposit accounts are fully insured by the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") up to the deposit insurance limits in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank's capital level and supervisory rating ("CAMELS rating"). The risk matrix uses different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for deposit insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA") provides for additional assessments to be imposed on insured depository institutions to pay for the cost of Financing Corporation ("FICO") funding. The FICO assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base of the DIF and do not vary depending upon a depository institution's capitalization or supervisory evaluation. 

Under FDIC laws and regulations, no FDIC-insured depository institution can accept brokered deposits unless it is well capitalized, or unless it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. Applicable laws and regulations also prohibit any depository institution that is not well capitalized from paying an interest rate on brokered deposits in excess of three-quarters of one percentage point over certain prevailing market rates.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of New York, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The Bank is subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the requirement to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, up to a maximum of $25.0 million. The Bank was in compliance with FHLB rules and requirements as of December 31, 2015.

Debit Card Interchange Fees

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act limit interchange fees on debit cards to a maximum of 21 &#160; cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion of assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. However, FRB regulations prohibit all issuers, including the Company and the Bank, from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.

Source of Strength Doctrine

FRB policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codifies the requirement that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. As a result, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loan by the Company to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. bankruptcy code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

In addition, under the National Bank Act, if the Bank's capital stock is impaired by losses or otherwise, the OCC is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the Company. If the assessment is not paid within three months, the OCC could order a sale of the Bank to cover any deficiency.

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action

In July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the "Capital Rules") that established a new capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (the "Basel Committee") December 2010 final capital framework referred to as "Basel III" for strengthening international capital standards. In addition, the Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules.

The Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the Company and the Bank, as compared to prior U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital and impacted the calculation of the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions.

The Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called "Common Equity Tier 1" ("CET1") and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan losses, in each case, subject to the Capital Rules' specific requirements.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are:

&#160;

&#9679; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160;

&#9679; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

&#160;

&#9679; 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the "leverage ratio"). 

The Capital Rules also require a "capital conservation buffer," composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the capital standards applicable to the Company will include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.

In addition, under the prior general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss ("AOCI") items included in shareholders' equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, banking organizations not using the advanced approaches, including the Company were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in January 2015. The Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from inclusion in bank holding companies' Tier 1 capital.

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015, are phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

With respect to the Bank, the Capital Rules revised the "prompt corrective action" ("PCA") regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 and a 3% leverage ratio to be considered adequately capitalized. The Capital Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category.

The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes.

Management believes that the Company is in compliance, and will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios as such requirements are phased in.

Volcker Rule

Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as the Company, from: (i) engaging in "proprietary trading" and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds ("Covered Funds"), subject to certain limited exceptions. The implementing regulation defines a Covered Fund to include certain investments such as collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") and collateralized debt obligation securities. The regulation also provides an exemption for CLOs meeting certain requirements. Compliance with the Volcker Rule is generally required by July 21, 2017. Given the Company's size and the scope of its activities, the Company does not believe the implementation of the Volcker Rule will have a significant effect on its financial statements.

Depositor Preference

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the "liquidation or other resolution" of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.

Consumer Protection and CFPB Supervision

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has examination authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. As the Company is below this threshold, the OCC continues to exercise primary examination authority over the Bank with regard to compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act state attorneys general are empowered to enforce rules issued by the CFPB.

The Company is subject to federal consumer financial statutes and the regulations promulgated thereunder including, but not limited to:

&#160;

&#9679;

the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

&#9679;

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA"), prohibiting discrimination in connection with the extension of credit;

&#9679;

the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA"), requiring home mortgage lenders, including the Bank, to make available to the public expanded information regarding the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the "rate spread" between the annual percentage rate and the average prime offer rate for mortgage loans of a comparable type;

&#9679;

the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and

&#9679;

the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage ("QM") provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the "QM Rule"). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of "qualified mortgage" are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM Rule requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM Rule requirements. The definition of a "qualified mortgage" incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM Rule definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA and VA underwriting guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. The QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014.

The Bank's failure to comply with any of the consumer financial laws can result in civil actions, regulatory enforcement action by the federal banking agencies and the U.S. Department of Justice.

USA PATRIOT Act

The Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA"), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act"), imposes obligations on U.S. financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries, to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. The USA PATRIOT Act also encourages information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities by providing an exemption from the privacy provisions of the GLB Act for financial institutions that comply with this provision. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act, which applies to the Bank, or the BHC Act, which applies to the Company. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences. As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank believe that they are in compliance with the BSA and the USA PATRIOT Act, and implementing regulations thereunder.

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the "OFAC" rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on "U.S. persons" engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Financial Privacy

Section V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations require all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties at the customer's request, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. In addition, FCRA, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 ("FACT Act"), includes many provisions affecting the Company, Bank, and/or their affiliates, including provisions concerning obtaining consumer reports, furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies, maintaining a program to prevent identity theft, sharing of certain information among affiliated companies, and other provisions. The FACT Act requires persons subject to FCRA to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit on terms less favorable than those generally available. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") have extensive rulemaking authority under the FACT Act, and the Company and the Bank are subject to the rules that have been promulgated under the FACT Act, including rules regarding limitations on affiliate marketing and implementation of programs to identify, detect and mitigate certain identity theft red flags. The Company has developed policies and procedures for itself and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, and believes it is in compliance with all privacy, information sharing, and notification provisions of the GLB Act and the FACT Act. The Bank is also subject to data security standards, privacy and data breach notice requirements, primarily those issued by the OCC.

Community Reinvestment Act of 1977

The Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. Regulators periodically assess the Bank's record of compliance with the CRA. In addition, the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The Bank's failure to comply with the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the Company. The Bank's latest CRA rating was "Satisfactory."

Employees

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,721 full-time equivalent employees. The Company's employees are not presently represented by any collective bargaining group.
