OPERATING SEGMENTS 

We have four complementary operating segments: Engine, Distribution, Components and Power Generation. These segments share technology, customers, strategic partners, brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products compete primarily on the basis of performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality, customer support and price. Financial information about our operating segments, including geographic information, is incorporated by reference from Note 21 , " OPERATING SEGMENTS ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

This joint venture manufactures several models of our heavy-duty and high-horsepower diesel engines, primarily serving the industrial and stationary power markets in China. &#32; 

Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary 

We have a controlling interest in Cummins India Ltd. (CIL), which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in India. CIL produces mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower engines, generators for the Indian and export markets and natural gas spark-ignited engines for power generation, automotive and industrial applications. CIL also has distribution and power generation operations. 

SUPPLY 

The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers. 

We use a category strategy process (a process designed to create the most value for the company) that reviews our long term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For the items we decide to purchase externally, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with long term to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units, including cylinder blocks and heads, turbochargers, connecting rods, camshafts, crankshafts, filters, alternators, electronic and emissions controls, and fuel systems. We source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers. Many key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that assure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. Approximately 56 &#32;percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers. Although we have elected to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from single suppliers, we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk. These processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness. Our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 63 percent &#32;of our direct material spend. As of December 31, 2015 , our analysis indicates that we have 44 percent &#32;of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or 70 percent &#32;of our target. 

Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include: 

&#8226; 

working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint; 

&#8226; 

selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct; and 

&#8226; 

assuring our suppliers comply with Cummins' prohibited and restricted materials policy. 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents, or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business. 

SEASONALITY 

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our Distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in Asia and Australia. 

LARGEST CUSTOMERS 

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for approximately 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015, compared to approximately 14 percent in 2014 and 12 percent in 2013. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty ISX 15 liter and ISX 11.9 liter engines and our ISL 9 liter mid-range engine. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2015. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have been an engine supplier to PACCAR for over 71 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion. 

In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty engine supply agreements with Daimler Trucks North America, Navistar and Volvo Trucks North America and long-term mid-range supply agreements with Daimler Trucks North America, Navistar and MAN. We also have an agreement with Fiat Chrysler to supply engines for its Ram trucks. In our off-highway markets, we have various engine and component supply agreements across our mid-range and high-horsepower businesses with Komatsu Ltd., as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our Engine, Component and Distribution segments. &#32;Collectively, our net sales to these seven customers, including PACCAR, were approximately 40 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015 , compared to approximately 36 percent in 2014 and 34 percent in 2013. &#32;Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015 , compared to less than 

8 percent in 2014 and less than 7 percent in 2013. &#32;These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. &#32; 

BACKLOG 

We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. At December 31, 2015 , we did not have any significant backlogs. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

In 2015 , we decrease d our research, development and engineering expenses however; we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies, continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy. 

Our research and development program is focused on product improvements, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. We generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $718 million &#32;in 2015, &#32; $737 million &#32;in 2014 and $700 million &#32;in 2013. &#32;Contract reimbursements were $98 million &#32;in 2015, &#32; $121 million &#32;in 2014 and $76 million &#32;in 2013. &#32; 

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately $90 million, $60 million and $32 million, or 13 percent, 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2017 EPA emission standards. 

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 

We adopted our first comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 to continue to positively impact the environment through the products we make, the way we use our facilities, management of our supply chain and improvement of the communities where we live and work. We examined our entire environmental footprint, focusing on the key areas of water, waste, energy and greenhouse gases and identified the top four environmental sustainability priorities of products in-use, materials and fuel efficiency, transportation and facilities and operations. We set initial goals in our facilities where we have the most data, influence and experience to: 

&#8226; 

reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent and 27 percent, respectively, by 2015 against a 2005 baseline and adjusted for sales; 

&#8226; 

reduce direct water use by 33 percent adjusted for hours worked and achieve water neutrality at 15 sites by 2020; and 

&#8226; 

increase our recycling rate from 88 percent to 95 percent and achieve zero disposal at 30 sites by 2020. 

In 2015, we set two new environmental sustainability goals: 

&#8226; 

First, we will partner with customers to improve the fuel efficiency of our products in-use, to target an annual reduction of 3.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save 350 million gallons of fuel by 2020 . 

&#8226; 

Second, we will work to utilize the most efficient methods and modes to move goods across the Cummins network to reduce carbon dioxide per kilogram of goods moved by 10 percent by 2020. 

In addition, in 2016, we expect to articulate a strategy around efficiency in product design and a material management strategy to decouple business growth from natural resource use. 

Since 2010, we reduced company-wide water use intensity by approximately 36 percent, U.S.-wide process-derived hazardous waste generation by approximately 29 percent and company-wide disposal waste by approximately 41 percent, all normalized to total work hours. As part of the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings, Better Plants program, we pledged to achieve 

a 25 percent energy intensity (energy use adjusted for sales) reduction by 2015; at the end of 2014, we had achieved a 34 percent reduction. 

We articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged with regulatory, industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally. For the tenth consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones North American Sustainability Index and were included in the 2015 &#8220;Disclosure Leadership Index&#8221; of the Carbon Disclosure Project&#8217;s climate report. In 2014, we were identified as a &#8220;Natural Capital Decoupling Leader&#8221; by Green Biz Group and Trucost for reductions in environmental footprint amid company growth. Our Sustainability Report for 2014/2015 and prior reports as well as data book of more detailed environmental data are available on our website at www.cummins.com , although such reports and data book are not incorporated into this Form 10-K. 

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

Product Environmental Compliance 

Cummins strives to have robust certification and compliance processes, adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide, including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products. We are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes, from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system, to test processes and results, and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required. 

We work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear, appropriately stringent, and enforceable, in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day. 

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise. We have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to , &#32;understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We have made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. Our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results. 

EU and EPA Engine Certifications 

The current on-highway emission standards came into effect in the European Union (EU) on January 1, 2013 (Euro VI) and on January 1, 2010 for the EPA. To meet the more stringent heavy-duty on-highway emission standards, we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology solutions and refined them for the EU and EPA certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines. We offer a complete lineup of on-highway engines to meet the near-zero emission standards. Mid-range and heavy-duty engines for EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology, next-generation cooled EGR, advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The EU, EPA, and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India and China are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows. 

We received certification from the EPA that we met both the EPA 2013 and 2014 greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations and rules. The EPA 2013 regulations add the requirement of On-Board Diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) required in 2010. On-Board Diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations were required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification was the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT TM ), Cummins Aftertreatment System with DPF and SCR technology. 

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations 

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2016. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations. 

In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites. Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. 

In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material. 

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 55,200 persons worldwide. Approximately 17,740 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2016 and 2021.
