The Company 

&#160; 

1. Organizational History 

&#160; 

We are the result of a share exchange transaction completed in March 2004 between the shareholders of Tintic Gold Mining Company (&#8220;Tintic&#8221;), a corporation originally incorporated in the state of Utah on June 14, 1933 to perform mining operations in Utah, and the shareholders of Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Ltd. (&#8220;Kiwa BVI&#8221;), a company originally organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on June 5, 2002. The share exchange resulted in a change of control of Tintic, with former Kiwa BVI stockholders owning approximately 89% of Tintic on a fully diluted basis and Kiwa BVI surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tintic. Subsequent to the share exchange transaction, Tintic changed its name to Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Corporation. On July 21, 2004, we completed our reincorporation in the State of Delaware. 

&#160; 

We established our subsidiary in China, Kiwa Bio-Tech Products (Shandong) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Kiwa Shandong&#8221;) in 2002 and Tianjin Kiwa Feed Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Kiwa Tianjin&#8221;) in July 2006. Effective on July 11, 2012, the Company dissolved Kiwa Tianjin. 

&#160; 

2. Overview of Business 

&#160; 

We develop, manufacture, distribute and market innovative, cost-effective and environmentally safe bio-technological products for agriculture. Our products are designed to enhance the quality of human life by increasing the value, quality and productivity of crops and decreasing the negative environmental impact of chemicals and other wastes. 

&#160; 

Bio-fertilizers 

&#160; 

We have developed a number of bio-fertilizers and are continuing to develop new products in this area. In 2002, Kiwa BVI chartered Kiwa Shandong, a wholly-owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the PRC, as its offshore fertilizer manufacturing base to capitalize on low cost, high quality manufacturing advantages available in China. In October 2003, Kiwa Shandong completed the first phase of construction of its manufacturing facility in Shandong Province, China. In November 2003, Kiwa Shandong began shipping its bio-fertilizer products to the agricultural market in China. Since then, we have been devoted to expanding our market share. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In June 2008, Kiwa Shandong received approval from the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC to sell fertilizer products of other manufacturers on a wholesale basis, including chemical fertilizers, complex fertilizers, and compound fertilizers. Based on applicable tax laws in China, these products will be exempt from value-added tax. 

&#160; 

During the last three years, the Company did not produce any products, had no market and failed to generate any revenue of material importance. 

&#160; 

We have developed six bio-fertilizer products with bacillus spp and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. Some of our products contain ingredients of both photosynthesis and bacillus bacteria. Bacillus spp is a species of bacteria that interacts with plants and promotes biological processes. It is highly effective for promoting plant growth, enhancing yield, improving quality and elevating resistances. Photosynthetic bacteria are a group of green and purple bacteria. Bacterial photosynthesis differs from green plant photosynthesis in that bacterial photosynthesis occurs in an anaerobic environment and does not produce oxygen. Photosynthetic bacteria can enhance the photosynthetic capacity of green plants by increasing the utilization of sunlight, which helps keep the photosynthetic process at a vigorous level, enhances the capacity of plants to transform inorganic materials to organic products, and boosts overall plant health and productivity. 

&#160; 

Our bacillus bacteria based fertilizers are protected by patents. In 2004, we acquired patent no. ZL 93101635.5 entitled &#8220;Highly Effective Composite Bacteria for Enhancing Yield and the Related Methodology for Manufacturing&#8221; from China Agricultural University (&#8220;CAU&#8221;) for the aggregate purchase of $480,411, consisting of $60,411 in cash and 5,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $84.00 per share (aggregate value of $420,000). Our photosynthetic bacteria based fertilizers are also protected by trade secret laws. 

&#160; 

The patent acquired from CAU covers six different species of bacillus which have been tested as bio-fertilizers to enhance yield and plant health. The production methods of the six species are also patented. The patent has expired on February 19, 2013.There are no limitations under this agreement on our exclusive use of the patent. Pursuant to our agreement with CAU, the University agreed to provide research and technology support services at no additional cost to us in the event we decide to use the patent to produce commercial products. These research and technology support services include: (1) furnishing faculty or graduate-level researchers to help bacteria culturing, sampling, testing, trial production and production formula adjustment; (2) providing production technology and procedures to turn the products into powder form while keeping live required bacteria in the products; (3) establishing quality standards and quality control systems; (4) providing testing and research support for us to obtain necessary sale permits from the Chinese government; and (5) cooperation in developing derivative products. 

&#160; 

On January 5, 2011, the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC (&#8220;Intellectual Property Office&#8221;) granted Kiwa Shandong two Certificates of Patent of Invention for (1) &#8220;A cucumber dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their specific strains with related application&#8221; with patent number of &#8220;ZL 2008 1 0144492.6&#8221;; and (2) &#8220;Cotton dedicated composite anti-continuous cropping effect probiotics and their special strains with related application&#8221; with patent number of &#8220;ZL 2008 1 0144491.1&#8221; These two patents have been developed by Kiwa-CAU R&#38;D Center. These two patents will expire on August 5, 2028. These two patents can be used to develop specific environment-friendly bio-fertilizer. 

&#160; 

We have obtained five fertilizer registration certificates from the Chinese government - four covering our bacillus bacteria fertilizer and one covering our photosynthetic bacteria fertilizer. The five registration certificates are: (1) Microorganism Microbial Inoculum Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (2) Photosynthetic Bacteria Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (3) Amino Acid Foliar Fomular Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture; (4) Organic Fertilizer Registration Certificate issued by Agriculture Department of Shandong Province; and (5) Organic Matter-Decomposing Inoculants Registration Certificate issued by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture on February 16, 2008. Protected by these five fertilizer registration certificates and five trademarks under the names of &#8220;KANGTAN&#8221; (Chinese translation name for Kiwa), &#8220;ZHIGUANGYOU,&#8221; &#8220;PUGUANGFU,&#8221; &#8220;JINWA&#8221; and &#8220;KANGGUAN,&#8221; we have developed six series of bio-fertilizer products with bacillus spp and/or photosynthetic bacteria as core ingredients. Valid period of fertilizer registration certificates is five years and be extended for another five years upon application from the owner of fertilizer registration certificates.
