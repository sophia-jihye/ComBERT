 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Vectrus, Inc. (Vectrus, the Company, our company, we, us or our) is a leading provider of services to the United States (U.S.) government worldwide. Leveraging a history of more than 70 &#32;years, we provide global service solutions in 132 &#32;locations and 18 &#32;countries across three &#32;continents in both stable and unstable political and economic environments. We have a proven history of deploying resources rapidly and with precision to support the mission success of our customers. 

&#32;We operate our business based on three core values of Integrity, Respect and Responsibility. We operate in a single segment and offer the following services: infrastructure asset management, logistics and supply chain management, and information technology and network communication. 

Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) with a high concentration in the U.S. Army. For the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we had total revenue of $1.2 billion , $1.2 billion &#32;and $1.5 billion , respectively, all of which was derived from U.S. government customers. 

We employ approximately 6,000 &#32;people and engage more than 7,000 &#32;subcontractor personnel around the world. This includes an experienced management team with an average of 30 &#32;years of experience in the military, industry, and a wide range of U.S. government agencies. Our management team has a proven track record of winning new contracts, driving premier operating efficiency, and managing all aspects of the demanding compliance culture required to do business with the U.S. government worldwide. We are also a leading employer of veterans with more than 35% &#32;of our employees reporting a military background, and we have been recognized numerous times in recent years by veteran-focused organizations as a military-friendly employer. 

Vectrus was incorporated as an Indiana corporation on February 4, 2014. On September 27, 2014, Exelis Inc. (Exelis) completed the spin-off (the Spin-off) of Vectrus. Prior to the Spin-off, we were a subsidiary of Exelis that constituted Exelis' Mission Systems business, which was part of Exelis' Information and Technical Services segment. Exelis Inc. was acquired by Harris Corporation on May 29, 2015. As a result of the Spin-off, Vectrus became an independent, publicly traded company. 

Our Business Strategy 

By delivering value to our customers through exceptional performance, we believe we are well positioned to continue to drive earnings and cash flow, and create value for our shareholders. Key components of our business strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Extend, Deepen and Enhance Our Technical Capabilities. We are internally investing in our own capabilities, with a view to adding capabilities that allow us to deliver higher value added and differentiated service. Over the course of the next several years, we plan to invest additional resources in our Information Technology and Network Communication service offering because we see potential for growth and the ability to provide higher value added services in this area. We plan to leverage our performance, customer relationships, global footprint, and financial position to pursue and capture more opportunities in the Information Technology and Network Communication market. 

&#8226; 

Continuous Improvement Culture. We cultivate a global Vectrus Improvement Project (VIP) culture that encourages every Vectrus employee to implement measurable improvements. The VIPs align with our business objectives benefiting our customers, employees, and performance. We support this VIP culture with a robust internal training program, arming our leaders with the tools to sustain our daily approach to continuous improvement. 

&#8226; 

Expand Our Geographic Footprint. Our business development resources are focused on opportunities both internationally and in the U.S. We believe that a primary strength of our company is our expeditionary nature that is grounded in our ability to recruit U.S. and international personnel with appropriate expertise, as well as navigate the logistical, legal, and other challenges of operating in multiple, challenging overseas locations. We believe our ability to ramp up quickly, and then sustain a qualified workforce on large, complex programs will continue to be a differentiator for our company. This capability enables us to win contracts from existing and new customers, and we expect will enhance our market leadership position. 

&#8226; 

Broaden Our Customer Base. We have a leadership position with the U.S. Army as well as a strong, growing contract base with the U.S. Air Force. We seek to provide our full range of offerings to U.S. and other government military and civil agencies worldwide. We believe our core strengths of program performance and operational excellence, including VIPs, and our focus on the needs and missions of our customers, have allowed us to thrive with current customers and have translated to growth with closely related, new U.S. government customers. 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on Essential Mission Critical Services. We intend to continue to provide services to the U.S. government in light of its reliance on civilian contractors and its significant expenditures on the types of services we provide. The requirements we fill are essential to the basic operation of the mission of our customers. We will pursue opportunities that provide mission critical and enduring services, such as information technology support.

Competition 

Our competition varies depending on our service offerings. In infrastructure asset management services, our primary competitors are PAE Facilities Management, Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. (DynCorp), KBR Inc., and Fluor Corporation. Our logistics and supply chain management services competitors include DynCorp and AECOM. Our principal competitors in information technology and network communication services include a division of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Harris Corporation, Science Application International Corporation, and CSRA, Inc. 

The U.S. government has implemented policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. Certain U.S. government work in the United States has been restricted to small businesses, including Alaska native companies, from time to time. We participate with these small businesses as a subcontractor for select opportunities, as appropriate. In addition, we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services will help us to win and perform the contract. Our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers&#8217; needs. 

Competitive bids for the work that Vectrus pursues are based on technical qualifications and corporate experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope, and are highly price sensitive. While not every contract is procured via selection of the lowest priced bidder, customers are sensitive to cost based on their budget allocations. Acquisition cycles are long (generally 12 to 24 months) and contracts typically have a five-year performance cycle, with some extending to ten years. 

U.S. government customers have shown a strong preference for multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. These contracts offer awards to a large pool of contractors, followed by competition within the pool for individual programs via task orders under each IDIQ over the period of performance. Period of performance under IDIQ contracts follows a traditional five- to- ten-year performance cycle. The governing IDIQ contracts often have multi-billion dollar ceiling values. 

There are typically fewer competitors in the overseas market for each of our services capabilities. We believe that a primary strength of our company is our expeditionary nature that is grounded in our ability to recruit U.S. and international personnel with appropriate expertise, as well as navigate the logistical, legal, and other challenges of operating in multiple, challenging overseas locations. 

We also believe that our company&#8217;s success in gaining market share is founded in exceptional performance of current contracts, which is required as references for future work. Our company closely monitors costs to foster highly competitive pricing and uses an in-house business development model both to manage the cost of revenue and to capture opportunities for future bids. 

Seasonality 

We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of awards, product deliveries, customer acceptance of products and services, contract phase-in durations, contract completions, and the availability of customer funding. 

Regulatory Environment 

The U.S. government markets in which we serve are highly regulated. We market our services to the DoD and equivalent foreign agencies, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and intelligence and other civilian agencies. When working with U.S. agencies and entities, we comply with laws and regulations relating to the creation, administration and performance of contracts. Among other things, these laws and regulations: 

&#8226; 

Require compliance with government standards for contract administration, accounting and management internal control systems; 

&#8226; 

Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced U.S. government contracts; 

&#8226; 

Require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations; 

&#8226; 

Require us not to compete for, or to divest ourselves of work, if an organizational conflict of interest exists related to such work and cannot be appropriately mitigated; and 

&#8226; 

Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 

U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government, agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD&#8217;s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various rules regarding procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, allowable costs, contract performance, contract termination and adjustment, and audits. In addition, as government contractors, we are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review our performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards under our contracts. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, and related business systems. 

The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new or revised contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance training relevant to their respective positions. 

We are subject to other U.S. government laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the False Claims Act. When working overseas, we must comply not only with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, but also with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. laws, including regulations relating to import-export control, foreign tax considerations, foreign labor and environmental law, and anti-corruption. 

Contracts 

U.S. government programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts to a prime contractor, which may utilize one or more subcontractors. We were the prime contractor on contracts representing 90% , 86% &#32;and 85% &#32;of our revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. Our company is principally a prime contractor on typically long-term, five- to- ten-year contracts. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend across several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The contracts and subcontracts under a program generally are subject to termination for convenience or adjustment if appropriations for such programs are not available or if they change. The U.S. government is required to equitably adjust a contract price for additions to or reductions in scope or other changes that it directs. 

Generally, the sales price elements for our contracts are cost-plus, cost-reimbursable or firm-fixed-price. We commonly have elements of cost-plus, cost-reimbursable and firm-fixed price contracts on a single contract. 

On a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract&#8217;s fee arrangement, up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. On cost-plus type contracts we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts. Most of our cost-plus contracts also contain a firm-fixed-price element. Cost-plus type contracts with award and incentive fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria. Incentive fees provide for a fee based on the relationship between total allowable and target cost. 

On most of our contracts, a cost-reimbursable element captures consumable materials required for the program. Typically these costs do not bear fees. 

A firm-fixed-price type contract typically offers higher profit margin potential than a cost-plus type contract, which is commensurate with the greater levels of risk we assume on a firm-fixed-price type contract. On a firm-fixed-price type contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a firm-fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. Accounting for revenue on a firm-fixed-price type contract that is covered by contract accounting standards requires the preparation of estimates of (1) the total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract&#8217;s statement of work, and (3) the measurement of progress towards completion. Adjustments to original estimates for a firm-fixed-price type contract&#8217;s revenue are often required as work progresses under a contract. Although the overall scope of work required under the contract may not change, profit can be adjusted as experience is gained and as efficiencies are realized or costs are incurred. 

The percentage of our total revenue generated from each contract type for the periods presented was as follows:

Backlog 

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer) and represents firm orders and potential options on multi-year contracts. Total backlog excludes potential orders under indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The amount of the backlog is based on anticipated revenue levels over the anticipated life of the contract. Actual amounts may be greater or less than anticipated. Total backlog is converted into revenue as work is performed. The level of order activity related to 

programs can be affected by the timing of government funding authorizations and their project evaluation cycles. Year-over-year comparisons could, at times, be impacted by these factors, among others. 

We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenue within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. government may terminate any contract at any time for convenience. Most of our contracts have provisions that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed in the event of a termination for convenience. 

We received funded orders of $1.1 billion &#32;during the year ended December 31, 2015 , which was a decrease of $319.1 million &#32;compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 &#32;due to the timing of funded orders for some of our contracts. Funded orders, which are different from funded backlog, represent orders for which funding was received during the period. 

Total backlog decreased by $440.2 million &#32;in the year ended December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , total backlog (funded and unfunded) was $2.4 billion .
