Acquisitions and Dispositions 

In July 2015, we purchased the Veyance North American air spring business (the "Air Spring Business") through the purchase of 100% of the stock of Veyance's Mexico business and of all of the assets of its U.S. business. The Air Spring Business is a manufacturer of air springs that are used in the suspension systems of commercial vehicles. Following the acquisition, it became part of EnPro's Stemco division within the Sealing Products segment. The Air Spring Business manufactures products in its facility in San Luis Potosi, Mexico with a commercial organization in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and engineering, testing and administrative resources in Fairlawn, Ohio. The addition of the Air Spring Business significantly expands Stemco's presence and scale in the commercial vehicle suspension market. 

On February 12, 2015, we acquired the stock of ATDynamics, Inc. ("ATDynamics"), a privately-held company offering innovative aerodynamic products to the commercial trucking industry. Following its acquisition, ATDynamics became part of EnPro&#8217;s Stemco division within the Sealing Products segment. ATDynamics, with operations in Texas and California, is the leading designer and manufacturer of a suite of clean technology products engineered to reduce fuel consumption in the global freight transportation industry. 

We paid $ 45.5 million , net of cash acquired, in 2015 for the businesses acquired in 2015. An additional amount of approximately $6 million &#32;is expected to be paid based on the finalized and agreed-upon acquisition date balance sheet of the Air Spring Business. 

In December 2014, we acquired Fabrico, Inc. ("Fabrico"), a privately-held company offering mission-critical components for the combustion and hot path sections of industrial gas and steam turbines. The business is headquartered in Oxford, Massachusetts with additional facilities in Charlton, Massachusetts and Greenville, South Carolina. The addition of Fabrico significantly expands our presence and scale in the land-based turbine seal and combustion market. 

In March 2014, we acquired the remaining interest of the Stemco Crewson LLC joint venture. As a result, we own all of the ownership interests in Stemco Crewson LLC. The joint venture was formed in 2009 with joint venture partner Tramec, LLC to expand our brake product offerings to include automatic brake adjusters. The purchase of the remaining interest in the joint venture allows us to accelerate investment in new product development and commercial strategies focused on market share growth for these products. 

In March 2014, we acquired the business of Strong-Tight Co. Ltd., a Taiwanese manufacturer and seller of gaskets and industrial sealing products. This acquisition adds an established Asian marketing presence and manufacturing facilities for our gasket and sealing products business. 

All of the businesses acquired in 2014 are included in our Sealing Products segment. We paid $ 61.9 million &#32;in 2014, net of cash acquired, for these businesses. The acquisition of Fabrico includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid based on the future gross profit of Fabrico during the two-years subsequent to the acquisition. The range of undiscounted amounts we could pay under the contingent consideration agreement is between $0 &#32;and $7.0 million . The fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date was $1.9 million . This amount was increased to $ 2.3 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 based on projected attainment. 

In January 2013, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a small distributor of industrial seals in Singapore which is managed as part of the Garlock operations in the Sealing Products segment. The acquisition was paid for with $2.0 million of cash. 

In December 2014, we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of the GRT business unit. GRT, which was a single manufacturing facility in Paragould, Arkansas, manufactures and sells conveyor belts and sheet rubber for many applications across a diversified array of end markets. It was previously managed as part of the Garlock operations in the Sealing Products segment. The business was sold for $42.3 million, net of transaction expenses; $3.0 million of the sales proceeds being held in an escrow account for 18 &#32;months to fund indemnification payments, if any, to the buyer under the sale agreement. GRT reported net sales of $31.3 million and $30.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Operations 

We manage our business as three segments: a Sealing Products segment, an Engineered Products segment, and a Power Systems segment. Our reportable segments are managed separately based on differences in their products and services and their end-customers. For financial information with respect to our business segments, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations,&#8221; and Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7 and Note 18 contain information about sales and profits for each segment, and Note 18 contains information about each segment&#8217;s assets. 

Sealing Products Segment 

Overview . Our Sealing Products segment includes three operating divisions, Garlock, Technetics and Stemco, that serve a wide variety of industries where performance and durability are vital for safety and environmental protection. Our products are used in many demanding environments, such as those characterized by high pressure, high temperature and chemical corrosion, and many of our products support critical applications with a low tolerance for failure. 

The Garlock family of companies designs, manufactures and sells sealing products, including: metallic, non-metallic and composite material gaskets; dynamic seals; compression packing; hydraulic components; expansion joints; flange sealing and isolation products; pipeline casing spacers/isolators; casing end seals; modular sealing systems for sealing pipeline penetrations; and safety-related signage for pipelines. 

Gasket products are used for sealing flange joints in chemical, petrochemical and pulp and paper processing facilities where high pressures, high temperatures and corrosive chemicals create the need for specialized and highly engineered sealing products. Our products are also used in sanitary markets such as food and pharma where product integrity and safety are extremely important.

These products have a long-standing reputation for performance and reliability within the industries we serve. 

Dynamic elastomeric seals are used in rotating applications to contain the lubricants that protect the bearings from excessive friction and heat generation. Because these sealing products are utilized in dynamic applications, they are subject to wear. Durability, performance, and reliability are, therefore, critical requirements of our customers. These rotary seals are used in demanding applications in the steel industry, mining and pulp and paper processing under well-known brand names including KLOZURE &#174; &#32;and Model 64 &#174; . 

Dynamic bearing isolator seals are used in power transmission systems to contain lubricants within bearing housings while also preventing contamination ingress. Bearing isolators provide users long-life sealing due to the non-contact seal design, and therefore are used in many OEM electric motors and gear boxes. GST LLC continues to innovate and build a patent portfolio of bearing isolator products. Its well-known brands include GUARDIAN &#8482; , ISO-GARD &#8482; , EnDuro &#8482; &#32;and SGi &#8482; . 

Gar-Seal &#174; &#32;brand PTFE-lined butterfly valves are used to control the flow of corrosive, abrasive or toxic media in the chemical processing industry. 

Compression packing is used to provide sealing in pressurized, static and dynamic applications such as pumps and valves. Major markets for compression packing products are the pulp and paper, mining, petrochemical and hydrocarbon processing industries. Branded products for these markets include EVSP&#8482;, Synthepak &#174; &#32;and Graph-lock &#174; . 

Critical service flange gaskets, seals and electrical flange isolation kits are used in high-pressure wellhead equipment, flow lines, water injection lines, sour hydrocarbon process applications and crude oil and natural gas pipeline/transmission line applications. These products are sold under the brand names Pikotek &#174; , VCS/LineSeal &#174; , VCFS&#8482;, Flowlok&#8482;, PGE&#8482;, LineBacker &#174; , LineBacker &#174; 61&#8482; NSF, GasketSeal &#174; &#32;and ElectroStop &#174; . Additional products for pipeline wall penetration sealing systems are supplied to water, construction and infrastructure industries under the Link-Seal &#174; &#32;and Century-Line &#174; &#32;brand names.

These components, which include packing and wiper rings, piston and rider rings, compressor valve assemblies, divider block valves, compressor monitoring systems, lubrication systems and related components are utilized primarily in the refining, petrochemical, natural gas gathering, storage and transmission, and general industrial markets. Brand names for our products include Hi-Flo&#8482;, Valvealert&#8482;, Mentor&#8482;, Triple Circle&#8482;, CPI Special Polymer Alloys&#8482;, Twin Ring&#8482;, Liard&#8482;, ProFlo&#8482;, Neomag&#8482;, CVP&#8482;, XDC&#8482;, POPR&#8482; and Protecting Compressors World Wide&#8482;. 

Customers . The Engineered Products segment sells its products to a diverse customer base using a combination of direct sales and independent distribution networks worldwide, with approximately 72% of sales delivered to customers outside the United States in 2015 . GGB has customers worldwide in all major industrial sectors, and supplies products directly to customers through GGB&#8217;s own local distribution system and indirectly to the market through independent agents and distributors with their own local networks. CPI sells its products and services globally through its internal sales force, independent sales representatives, distributors, and service centers. In 2015 , the largest customer accounted for approximately 2% of segment revenues. 

Competition . GGB has a number of competitors, including Kolbenschmidt Pierburg AG, Saint-Gobain&#8217;s Norglide division, and Federal-Mogul Corporation. In the markets in which GGB competes, competition is based primarily on performance of the product for specific applications, product reliability, delivery, and price. CPI competes against other component manufacturers and service providers, such as Cook Compression, Hoerbiger Corporation, Graco and numerous 

smaller component manufacturers. In the markets served by CPI, the primary competitive drivers are trusted solutions with personalized customer care, product quality, availability, engineering support, and price. 

Raw Materials . GGB&#8217;s major raw material purchases include steel coil, bronze powder, bronze coil, PTFE and aluminum. GGB sources components from a number of external suppliers. CPI&#8217;s major raw material purchases include PTFE, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), compound additives, bronze, steel, and stainless steel bar stock. We believe all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers, though there are limited suppliers for certain other minor, but critical, raw materials. 

Power Systems Segment 

Overview . Our Power Systems segment (formerly Engine Products and Services) designs, manufactures, sells and services heavy-duty, medium-speed diesel, natural gas and dual fuel reciprocating engines. We market these products and services under the Fairbanks Morse &#174; &#32;brand name. Products in this segment include licensed heavy-duty, medium-speed diesel, natural gas and dual fuel reciprocating engines, in addition to our own designs. The reciprocating engines range in size from 700 to 31,970 horsepower and from five to 20 cylinders. These products are used in marine, oil and gas, and power generation markets. We have been building engines for over 115 years under the Fairbanks Morse &#174; &#32;brand name and we have a large installed base of engines for which we supply aftermarket parts and service. Fairbanks Morse has been a key supplier to the U.S. Navy for medium-speed diesel engines and has supplied engines to the U.S. Navy for over 70 years. 

Customers . Our Power Systems segment sells its products and services to customers worldwide, including major shipyards, municipal utilities, institutional and industrial organizations, sewage treatment plants, nuclear power plants and offshore oil and gas platforms, with approximately 10% of sales delivered to customers outside the United States in 2015 . We market our products through a direct sales force of engineers in North America and through independent agents worldwide. Our representative customers include Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp., Electricite de France, EcoPetrol, and Exelon. In 2015 , the largest customer accounted for approximately 11% of segment revenues. 

Competition . Major competitors for our Power Systems segment include MTU, Caterpillar Inc., and Wartsila Corporation. Price, delivery time, engineering and service support, and engine efficiency relating to fuel consumption and emissions drive competition. 

Raw Materials and Components . Our Power Systems segment purchases multiple ferrous and non-ferrous castings, forgings, plate stock and bar stock for fabrication and machining into engines. In addition, we buy a considerable amount of precision-machined engine components. We believe all of these raw materials and components are readily available from various suppliers, but may be subject to long and variable lead times. In December of 2015, the foundry which was our primary supplier of castings ceased operations and a receiver was appointed to liquidate its assets. As a result, we are actively working to qualify replacement sources for certain castings. Any delays in obtaining such castings could adversely affect quarterly operating results. 

Research and Development 

The goal of our research and development effort is to strengthen our product portfolios for traditional markets while simultaneously creating distinctive and breakthrough products. We utilize a process to move product innovations from concept to commercialization, and to identify, analyze, develop and implement new product concepts and opportunities aimed at business growth. 

We employ scientists, engineers and technicians throughout our operations to develop, design and test new and improved products. We work closely with our customers to identify issues and develop technical solutions. The majority of our research and development spending typically is directed toward the development of new sealing products for the most demanding environments, the development of truck and trailer fleet information systems, the development of bearing products and materials with increased load carrying capability and superior friction and wear characteristics, and the development of power systems to meet current and future emissions requirements while improving fuel efficiencies. 

Backlog 

At December 31, 2015 , we had a backlog of orders valued at $346.6 million compared with $385.9 million at December 31, 2014 . Approximately 19% of the backlog, primarily in our Power Systems segment, is expected to be filled beyond 2016. Backlog represents orders on hand we believe to be firm. However, there is no certainty the backlog orders will result in actual sales at the times or in the amounts ordered. In addition, for most of our business, backlog is not particularly predictive of future performance because of our short lead times and some seasonality. 

Quality Assurance 

We believe product quality is among the most important factors in developing and maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our customers. In order to meet the exacting requirements of our customers, we maintain stringent standards of quality control. We routinely employ in-process inspection by using testing equipment as a process aid during all stages of development, design and production to ensure product quality and reliability. These include state-of-the-art CAD/CAM equipment, statistical process control systems, laser tracking devices, failure mode and effect analysis, and coordinate measuring machines. We are able to extract numerical quality control data as a statistical measurement of the quality of the parts being manufactured from our CNC machinery. In addition, we perform quality control tests on parts that we outsource. As a result, we are able to significantly reduce the number of defective parts and therefore improve efficiency, quality and reliability. 

As of December 31, 2015 , 48 of our manufacturing facilities were ISO 9000, QS 9000 and/or TS 16949 certified. Twenty-one of our facilities are ISO 14001 certified. OEMs are increasingly requiring these standards in lieu of individual certification procedures and as a condition of awarding business. 

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

We maintain a number of patents and trademarks issued by the U.S. and other countries relating to the name and design of our products and have granted licenses to some of these patents and trademarks. We routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the U.S. and other countries. We also have unpatented proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products and their use. We do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent, patent right, trademark, trade secret or license granted or group of related patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses granted. 

In general, we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell. However, we also license patented and other proprietary technology and processes from various companies and individuals in order to broaden our product offerings. We are dependent on the ability of these third parties to diligently protect their intellectual property rights. In several cases, the intellectual property licenses are integral to the manufacture of our products. For example, Fairbanks Morse licenses technology from MAN Diesel and its subsidiaries for certain of the four-stroke reciprocating engines it produces. The terms of the licenses vary by engine type. One set of licenses is set to expire on March 31, 2016, subject to negotiations to renew these licenses for a multi-year period. Licenses for the remaining engine types have terms, subject to potential renewal, expiring in 2018 or 2019. A loss of these licenses or a failure on the part of the licensor to protect its own intellectual property could reduce our revenues. These licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated for a material breach. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 

Employees and Labor Relations 

We currently have approximately 5,400 employees worldwide in our continuing operations. Approximately 2,800 employees are located within the U.S., and approximately 2,600 employees are located outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, Canada and China. Approximately 23% of our U.S. employees are members of trade unions covered by three collective bargaining agreements with contract expiration dates from February 2017 to November 2018. Union agreements relate, among other things, to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. The wages and benefits furnished are generally comparable to industry and area practices. Our deconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily GST LLC, have about 900 additional employees worldwide.
