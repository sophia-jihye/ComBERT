Introduction 

Crestwood Equity, a Delaware limited partnership formed in March 2001, is a master limited partnership (MLP) that develops, acquires, owns or controls, and operates primarily fee-based assets and operations within the energy midstream sector. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we provide broad-ranging infrastructure solutions across the value chain to service premier liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil shale plays across the United States. We own and operate a diversified portfolio of crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing, storage and transportation assets that connect fundamental energy supply with energy demand across North America. Crestwood Equity's common units representing limited partner interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;CEQP.&#8221; 

Crestwood Equity is a holding company. All of our consolidated operating assets are owned by or through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a Delaware limited partnership. Our consolidated operating assets primarily include: 

&#8226; 

natural gas facilities with approximately 2.6 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 481 MMcf/d of processing capacity, 40.9 Bcf of certificated working gas storage capacity and 1.3 Bcf/d of firm pipeline transmission capacity; 

&#8226; 

NGL facilities with approximately 24,000 Bbls/d of fractionation capacity and 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting more than 294,000 Bbls/d of NGLs; and 

&#8226; 

crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, approximately 1.5 million barrels of total storage capacity, 48,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity and 160,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity. 

Our primary business objective is to maximize the value of Crestwood for all stakeholders. 

Ownership Structure 

The diagram below reflects a simplified version of our ownership structure as of December 31, 2015: 

Crestwood Equity . Crestwood Equity GP LLC, which is indirectly owned by Crestwood Holdings LLC (Crestwood Holdings), owns our non-economic general partnership interest. Crestwood Holdings, which is substantially owned and controlled by First Reserve Management, L.P. (First Reserve), also owns approximately 21% of Crestwood Equity's limited partner and subordinated units as of December 31, 2015. 

Crestwood Midstream . Crestwood Equity owns a 99.9% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream and Crestwood Gas Services GP LLC (CGS GP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owns a 0.1% limited partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream. Crestwood Midstream GP LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owns the non-economic general partnership interest of Crestwood Midstream. 

Crestwood Merger (2013) . In May 2013, Crestwood Holdings and the former owners of Crestwood Equity's general partner entered into a series of transactions that would effectively consolidate and combine the operations of Legacy Crestwood and Legacy Inergy. The parties first completed a series of &#8220;upstairs&#8221; transactions in June 2013 that resulted in Crestwood Holdings&#8217; acquisition of control of Crestwood Equity. The &#8220;downstairs&#8221; portion of the strategic business combination was completed in October 2013 when publicly-traded Legacy Crestwood merged with and into publicly-traded Inergy Midstream (the Crestwood Merger) and Inergy Midstream immediately thereafter changed its name to Crestwood Midstream Partners LP. 

Simplification Merger (2015) . In May 2015, Crestwood Equity, Crestwood Midstream and certain of their affiliates entered into a definitive agreement under which Crestwood Midstream would merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, with Crestwood Midstream surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity (the Simplification Merger). On September 30, 2015, the Simplification Merger was completed immediately following the affirmative approval of the merger by Crestwood Midstream's unaffiliated unitholders. 

Prior to the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Equity indirectly owned a non-economic general partnership interest in Crestwood Midstream and 100% of its incentive distribution rights (IDRs), which entitled Crestwood Equity to receive 50% of all distributions paid to Crestwood Midstream's common unit holders in excess of its initial quarterly distribution of $0.37 per common unit. Crestwood Midstream's common units were also listed on the NYSE under the listing symbol "CMLP." Upon becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity as a result of the Simplification Merger, Crestwood Midstream's IDRs were eliminated and its common units ceased to be listed on the NYSE. 

See Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Notes 1 &#32;and 3 for additional information on these related transactions. 

Our Assets 

Prior to the Simplification Merger, except for the assets comprising our NGL marketing business, all of our operating assets were owned by or through Crestwood Midstream. Crestwood Operations LLC (Crestwood Operations), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crestwood Equity, owned and operated the assets comprising our NGL marketing business, consisting mainly of our West Coast NGL assets, our Seymour NGL storage facility, and our NGL transportation terminals and fleet. In connection with the closing of the Simplification Merger on September 30, 2015, Crestwood Equity contributed 100% of its interests in Crestwood Operations to Crestwood Midstream. As a result of this equity contribution, and as of December 31, 2015, all of the Company's consolidated assets are owned by or through Crestwood Midstream. 

In conjunction with the Simplification Merger, we modified our segments and our financial statements now reflect three &#32;operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing operations; (ii) storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics operations (formerly NGL and crude services operations). Consequently, the results of our Arrow operations are now reflected in our gathering and processing operations for all periods presented and our COLT Hub operations and Powder River Basin Industrial Complex, LLC (PRBIC) investment are now reflected in our storage and transportation operations for all periods presented. These respective operations were previously included in our NGL and crude services operations. Below is a description of our operating and reporting segments. 

Gathering and Processing 

Our G&#38;P operations provide gathering and transportation services (natural gas, crude oil and produced water) and processing, treating and compression services (natural gas) to producers in unconventional shale plays and tight-gas plays in North Dakota, West Virginia, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming, Arkansas and Louisiana. This segment primarily includes (i) our crude oil, gas and produced water gathering systems in the Bakken Shale play; (ii) our rich gas gathering systems and processing plants in the Bakken, Marcellus, Barnett, Delaware Permian and Powder River Basin (PRB) Niobrara Shale plays; and (iii) our dry gas gathering systems in the Barnett, Fayetteville, and Haynesville Shale plays.

Consists of 215 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline, 194 miles of crude oil gathering pipeline, and 181 miles of produced water gathering pipeline. 

(2) 

Our PRB Niobrara assets are owned by Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope), our 50% equity method investment. 

We generate G&#38;P revenues predominantly under fee-based contracts, which minimizes our commodity price exposure and provides less volatile operating performance and cash flows. Our principal G&#38;P systems are described below. 

Bakken 

Our Arrow system gathers crude oil, rich gas and produced water from wells operating on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota. Located approximately 60 miles southeast of the COLT Hub, the Arrow system connects to our COLT Hub through the Hiland and Tesoro crude oil pipeline systems. The Arrow system includes approximately 590 miles of gathering lines, a 23-acre central delivery point with 266,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity and multiple pipeline take-away outlets, and salt water disposal wells. Our operations are anchored by long-term gathering contracts with producers who have dedicated over 150,000 acres to the Arrow system, and our underlying contracts largely provide for fixed-fee gathering services with annual escalators for crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services. 

Marcellus 

We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison, Doddridge and Barbour Counties, West Virginia. These systems consist of 80 miles of low pressure gathering lines and ten compression and dehydrations stations with 138,080 horsepower. Through these systems, we provide midstream services, primarily to Antero Resources Appalachian Corporation (Antero), under long-term, fixed-fee contracts across two operating areas: our eastern area of operation (East AOD), where we are the exclusive gatherer, and our western area of operation (Western Area), where we provide compression services. 

In the East AOD, we provide gathering, dehydration and compression services, on a fixed-fee basis, to Antero on approximately 140,000 gross acres dedicated pursuant to a 20-year gathering and compression agreement. The gathering agreement provides for an annual minimum volume commitment of 450 MMcf/d in 2016 through 2018. We gather and ultimately redeliver Antero&#8217;s production to MarkWest's Sherwood Gas Processing Plant and various regional pipeline systems, 

including Columbia, EQT, Dominion and Momentum's Stonewall pipeline which was placed into service in December 2015. Our system is currently connected to 233 Antero wells. 

In the Western Area, we provide compression and dehydration services to Antero&#8217;s gathering facilities predominantly with our West Union and Victoria compressor stations under a seven year, fixed-fee agreement that runs through 2021, subject to Antero&#8217;s right to extend the contract term for an additional three years. In the Western Area, Antero provides minimum volume commitments for approximately 50% of the throughput capacity of each compressor station. 

Barnett &#32;&#32; 

We own and operate three systems in the Barnett Shale, including the Cowtown, Lake Arlington and the Alliance systems. 

Our Cowtown system, which is located principally in the southern portion of the Fort Worth Basin, consists of (i) pipelines that gather rich natural gas produced by customers and deliver the volumes to our plants for processing, (ii) the Cowtown plant, which includes two natural gas processing units that extract NGLs from the natural gas stream and deliver customers&#8217; residue gas and extracted NGLs to unaffiliated pipelines for sale downstream, and (iii) the Corvette plant, which extracts NGLs from the natural gas stream and delivers customers&#8217; residue gas and extracted NGLs to unaffiliated pipelines for sale downstream. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our plants had a total average throughput of 128 MMcf/d of natural gas with an average NGL recovery of 10,000 Bbl/d. In June 2015, we shut down the Corvette plant and diverted processing volumes to the Cowtown plant but we continue to use the compression facilities at the Corvette plant. 

Our Lake Arlington system, which is located in eastern Tarrant County, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and related dehydration and compression facilities. Our Alliance system, which is located in northern Tarrant and southern Denton Counties, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and a related dehydration, compression and amine treating facility. 

Fayetteville 

We own and operate five systems in the Fayetteville Shale, including the Twin Groves, Prairie Creek, Woolly Hollow, Wilson Creek, and Rose Bud systems. Our Twin Groves, Prairie Creek, and Woolly Hollow systems (Conway and Faulkner Counties) consist of three gas gathering, compression, dehydration and treating facilities. Our Wilson Creek (Van Buren County) and Rose Bud (White County) systems each consist of a gas gathering system and related dehydration and compression facilities. All of our systems gather natural gas produced by customers and deliver customers&#8217; gas to unaffiliated pipelines for downstream sale. 

Delaware Permian 

We own and operate several gas gathering and processing systems in the fast growing Delaware Permian region. Our systems, located in Eddy County, New Mexico, consists of two dry gas gathering systems (Las Animas systems) and one rich gas gathering system and processing plant (Willow Lake system). In July 2014, we expanded our Willow Lake system to include a 20 MMcf/d processing plant. The Willow Lake expansion was anchored by a 10-year fixed-fee agreement with Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), formerly Legend Production Holdings, LLC. 

In late 2015, we expanded the Willow Lake processing plant to 50 MMcf/d, which we completed and placed into service in January 2016. The recent expansion of the Willow Lake system was supported by a seven year contract extension with Mewbourne Oil Co. (Mewbourne) which significantly increased the amount of WolfCamp drilling and rich gas development expected in the area. 

Other 100% Owned and Operated Systems 

We also own and operate systems in the Granite Wash and the Haynesville/Bossier Shales. Our Indian Creek system, which is located in Roberts County, Texas in the Granite Wash, includes a rich gas gathering system, compression facility and processing plant. Our Sabine system, which is located in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, includes high-pressure gas gathering pipelines that provide gathering and treating services for producers in the Haynesville/Bossier Shale. 

PRB Niobrara Joint Venture 

Our G&#38;P segment includes our 50% equity interest in the Jackalope joint venture with Williams Partners LP (Williams), which we account for under the equity method of accounting. The joint venture, operated by Williams, owns the Jackalope gas gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant, which serves a 388,000 gross acre dedication, operated by Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake) in Converse County, Wyoming. The Jackalope system consists of approximately 211 miles of gathering pipelines, 50,895 horsepower of compression and the 120 MMcf/d Bucking Horse processing plant, which was placed into service in January 2015. The system connects to 88 well pads and is supported by a 20-year gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake. Under the agreement, Jackalope receives cost-of-service based fees with annual redeterminations sufficient to provide Jackalope a fixed return on all capital invested to build out and expand the system over the life of the contract. See Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of our investment in Jackalope.

In December 2014, Crestwood Equity sold 100% of its membership interest in Tres Palacios, which owns a FERC-certificated 38.4 Bcf multi-cycle salt dome natural gas storage facility located in Texas, to Tres Holdings. Crestwood Midstream and Brookfield Infrastructure Group (Brookfield) formed Tres Holdings for the purpose of acquiring owning and operating Tres Palacios and each joint venture member paid approximately $66.4 million of cash to Crestwood Equity for Tres Palacios. As a result of this transaction, Crestwood Midstream owns 50.01% of Tres Palacios and operates its natural gas storage facility. Brookfield owns the remaining 49.99% interest in Tres Palacios. 

The Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility's 63-mile, dual 24-inch diameter header system (including a 52-mile north pipeline lateral and an approximate 11-mile south pipeline lateral) interconnects with 10 pipeline systems and can receive residue gas from the tailgate of Kinder Morgan Inc.'s Houston Central processing plant. The certificated maximum injection rate of the Tres Palacios storage facility is 1,000 MMcf/d and the certificated maximum withdrawal rate is 2,500 MMcf/d. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of our membership interest in Tres Palacios. 

Transportation Facilities . We own three natural gas pipeline systems located in New York and Pennsylvania. Throughput on our interstate and intrastate pipeline systems can be expanded at relatively low capital costs. In 2015, our transportation facilities delivered approximately 1.3 Bcf/d of natural gas on a firm or interruptible basis for our transportation and storage customers. Our natural gas transportation facilities include: 

&#8226; 

North-South Facilities , which include compression and appurtenant facilities installed to expand transportation capacity on the Stagecoach north and south pipeline laterals. The bi-directional interstate facilities, which are owned and operated by Stagecoach Pipeline, provide more than 547 MMcf/d of firm interstate transportation capacity to shippers. The North-South Facilities generate fee-based revenues under a negotiated rate structure authorized by the FERC. 

&#8226; 

MARC I Pipeline , a 39-mile, 30-inch diameter interstate natural gas pipeline that connects the Stagecoach south lateral and TGP's 300 Line in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, with Transco&#8217;s Leidy Line in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. The bi-directional pipeline, which is owned and operated by Stagecoach Pipeline, provides more than 716 MMcf/d of firm interstate transportation capacity to shippers. It includes a 16,360 horsepower gas-fired compressor station near the Transco interconnection, and a 15,000 horsepower electric-powered compressor station at the interconnection between the Stagecoach south lateral and TGP&#8217;s 300 Line. The MARC I Pipeline generates fee-based revenues under a negotiated rate structure authorized by the FERC. 

We completed an open season for an expansion of the MARC I Pipeline in the first quarter of 2015 and have entered into firm service contracts with multiple customers for the expansion capacity. This project includes a new 530 MMcf/d supply point into the MARC I Pipeline (Wilmot Station) through an interconnection with Appalachian Midstream Services and 280 MMcf/d expansion of the existing interconnect between MARC I and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco). The Transco expansion project was completed and placed into service in November 2015. 

&#8226;

The pipeline, which is owned by Crestwood Pipeline East, LLC (CPE), runs within three miles of our Stagecoach north lateral's point of interconnection with Millennium. The East Pipeline generates fee-based revenues under a negotiated rate structure authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYPSC). 

Rail Loading Facilities . We own or have interest in crude oil rail loading facilities in North Dakota and Wyoming. Our crude oil rail loading facilities include: 

&#8226; 

COLT Hub . The COLT Hub consists of our integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in the heart of the Bakken and Three Forks Shale oil-producing areas in Williams County, North Dakota. It has approximately 1.2 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity and is capable of loading up to 160,000 Bbls/d. Customers can source crude oil for rail loading through interconnected gathering systems, a twelve-bay truck unloading rack and the COLT Connector, a 21-mile 10-inch bi-directional proprietary pipeline that connects the COLT terminal to our storage tank at Dry Fork (Beaver Lodge/Ramberg junction). The COLT Hub is connected to the Meadowlark Midstream Company, LLC and Hiland Partners, LP (Hiland) crude oil gathering systems at the COLT terminal, and the Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. and Tesoro Corporation (Tesoro) pipeline systems at Dry Fork. 

&#8226; 

PRBIC . PRBIC, our 50.01% equity-method investment, owns an integrated crude oil loading, storage and pipeline terminal located in Douglas County, Wyoming, which provides a market for crude oil production from the PRB Niobrara. The joint venture, operated by Twin Eagle Resource Management, LLC (Twin Eagle), sources crude oil production from Chesapeake and other PRB Niobrara producers. PRBIC includes 20,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity and 380,000 barrels of crude oil working storage capacity. Additionally, in anticipation of growing PRB Niobrara crude oil volumes, PRBIC expanded its pipeline terminal to include connections to Kinder Morgan's HH Pipeline system in July 2015 and initiated a pipeline project to interconnect with Plains All American Pipeline's Rocky Mountain Pipeline system, which is expected to be completed in March 2016. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of our investment in PRBIC.

We separate NGLs from natural gas, deliver to local natural gas pipelines, and retain NGLs for 

further processing at our fractionation facility, as well as provide butane isomerization and refrigerated storage services. Our isomerization facility chemically changes normal butane to isobutane, which we provide to Western US refineries for motor fuel production; 

&#8226; 

our NGL storage facilities include the Seymour and Bath storage facilities. The Seymour storage facility is located in Seymour, Indiana, and has 21 million gallons of underground NGL storage capacity and 1.2 million gallons of aboveground "bullet" storage capacity. The facility's receipts and deliveries are supported by Enterprise Teppco pipeline, allowing pipeline and truck access. The Bath storage facility is located in Bath, New York and has 1.7 million gallons of underground NGL storage capacity and is supported by both rail and truck terminal facilities capable of loading and unloading 23 rail cars per day and approximately 100 truck transports per day; and 

&#8226; 

NGL pipeline and storage capacity leased from third parties, including more than 500,000 barrels of NGL working storage capacity at major hubs in Mt. Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas. 

Crude Oil and Produced Water Trucking . Our crude oil and produced water trucking fleet has 48,000 Bbls/d of crude oil and produced water transportation capacity. These assets were acquired in the first half of 2014. We provide hauling services to customers in North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Texas and New Mexico. 

US Salt . US Salt is an industry-leading solution mining and salt production company located on the shores of Seneca Lake near Watkins Glen in Schuyler County, New York. It is one of five major solution mined salt manufacturers in the United States, capable of producing more than 400,000 tons of evaporated salt products for food, industrial and pharmaceutical uses. The solution mining process used by US Salt creates salt caverns that can be converted into natural gas and NGL storage capacity. &#32; 

Customers 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Tesoro accounted for approximately 12% of our total consolidated revenues. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Industry Background 

The midstream sector of the energy industry provides the link between exploration and production and the delivery of crude oil, natural gas and their components to end-use markets. The midstream sector consists generally of gathering, processing, storage, and transportation activities. We gather crude oil and natural gas; process natural gas; fractionate NGLs; store crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and transport crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. 

The diagram below depicts the main segments of the midstream sector value chain: 

Crude Oil 

Pipelines typically provide the most cost-effective option for shipping crude oil. Crude oil gathering systems normally comprise a network of small-diameter pipelines connected directly to the well head that transport crude oil to central receipt points or interconnecting pipelines through larger diameter trunk lines. Common carrier pipelines frequently transport crude oil from central delivery points to logistics hubs or refineries under tariffs regulated by the FERC or state authorities. Logistic hubs provide storage and connections to other pipeline systems and modes of transportation, such as railroads and trucks. Pipelines not engaged in the interstate transportation of crude may also be proprietary or leased entirely to a single customer. 

Trucking complements pipeline gathering systems by gathering crude oil from operators at remote wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems. Trucking is generally limited to low volume, short haul movements because trucking costs escalate sharply with distance, making trucking the most expensive mode of crude oil transportation. Railroads provide additional transportation capabilities for shipping crude oil between gathering storage systems, pipelines, terminals and storage centers and end-users. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas 

Midstream companies within the natural gas industry create value at various stages along the value chain by gathering natural gas from producers at the wellhead, processing and separating the hydrocarbons from impurities and into lean gas (primarily methane) and NGLs, and then routing the separated lean gas and NGL streams for delivery to end-markets or to the next stage of the value chain. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of natural gas produced at the wellhead contains NGLs. Natural gas produced in association with crude oil typically contains higher concentrations of NGLs than natural gas produced from gas wells. This rich natural gas is generally not acceptable for transportation in the nation&#8217;s transmission pipeline system or for residential or commercial use. Processing plants extract the NGLs, leaving residual lean gas that meets transmission pipeline quality specifications for ultimate consumption. Processing plants also produce marketable NGLs, which, on an energy equivalent basis, typically have a greater economic value as a raw material for petrochemicals and motor gasolines than as a component of the natural gas stream. 

Gathering. &#32;&#32; At the earliest stage of the midstream value chain, a network of typically small diameter pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads or pad sites in the production area. Gathering systems transport gas from the wellhead to downstream pipelines or a central location for treating and processing. Gathering systems are often designed to be highly flexible to allow gathering of natural gas at different pressures and scalable to allow for additional production and well connections without significant incremental capital expenditures. A byproduct of the gathering process is the recovery of condensate liquids, which are sold on the open market. 

Compression. &#32;&#32; Gathering systems are operated at pressures intended to enable the maximum amount of production to be gathered from connected wells. Through a mechanical process known as compression, volumes of natural gas at a given pressure are compressed to a sufficiently higher pressure, thereby allowing those volumes to be delivered into a higher pressure downstream pipeline to be shipped to market. Because wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they age, it becomes necessary to add additional compression over time to maintain throughput across the gathering system. 

Treating and Dehydration. &#32;&#32; Treating and dehydration involves the removal of impurities such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide that may be present when natural gas is produced at the wellhead. Impurities must be removed for the natural gas to meet the quality specifications for pipeline transportation, and end users normally cannot consume (and will not purchase) natural gas with a high level of impurities. Therefore, to meet downstream pipeline and end user natural gas quality standards, the natural gas is dehydrated to remove water and is chemically treated to separate the impurities from the natural gas stream. 

Processing. &#32;&#32; Once impurities are removed, pipeline-quality residue gas is separated from NGLs. Most rich natural gas is not suitable for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use and must be processed to remove the heavier hydrocarbon components. The removal and separation of hydrocarbons during processing is possible because of the differences in physical properties between the components of the raw gas stream. There are four basic types of natural gas processing methods: cryogenic expansion, lean oil absorption, straight refrigeration and dry bed absorption. Cryogenic expansion represents the latest generation of processing, incorporating extremely low temperatures and high pressures to provide the best processing and most economical extraction. 

Natural gas is processed not only to remove heavier hydrocarbon components that would interfere with pipeline transportation or the end use of the natural gas, but also to separate from the natural gas those hydrocarbon liquids that could have a higher value as NGLs than as natural gas. The principal component of residue gas is methane, although some lesser amount of entrained ethane typically remains. In some cases, processors have the option to leave ethane in the gas stream or to recover ethane from the gas stream, depending on ethane&#8217;s value relative to natural gas. The processor&#8217;s ability to &#8220;reject&#8221; ethane varies depending on the downstream pipeline&#8217;s quality specifications. The residue gas is sold to industrial, commercial and residential customers and electric utilities. 

Fractionation. &#32;Once NGLs have been removed from the natural gas stream, they can be broken down into their base components to be useful to commercial customers. Mixed NGL streams can be further separated into purity NGL products, including ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline. Fractionation works based on the different boiling points of the different hydrocarbons in the NGL stream, and essentially occurs in stages consisting of the boiling off of hydrocarbons one by one. The entire fractionation process is broken down into steps, starting with the removal of the lighter NGLs from the stream. In general, fractionators are used in the following order: (i) deethanizer, which separates ethane from the NGL stream, (ii) depropanizer, which separates propane, (iii) debutanizer, which boils off the butanes and leaves the pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons in the NGL stream, and (iv) butane splitter (or deisobutanizer), which separates isobutanes and normal butanes. 

Transportation and Storage. &#32;&#32; Once raw natural gas has been treated or processed and the raw NGL mix fractionated into individual NGL components, the natural gas and NGL components are stored, transported and marketed to end-use markets. The natural gas pipeline grid in the United States transports natural gas from producing regions to customers, such as LDCs, industrial users and electric generation facilities. 

Historically, the concentration of natural gas production in a few regions of the United States generally required transportation pipelines to transport gas not only within a state but also across state borders to meet national demand. However, a recent shift in supply sources, from conventional to unconventional, has affected the supply patterns, the flows and the rates that can be charged on pipeline systems. The impacts vary among pipelines according to the location and the number of competitors attached to these new supply sources. These changing market dynamics are prompting midstream companies to evaluate the construction of short-haul pipelines as a means of providing demand markets with cost-effective access to newly-developed production regions, as compared to relying on higher-cost, long-haul pipelines that were originally designed to transport natural gas greater distances across the country. 

Natural gas storage plays a vital role in maintaining the reliability of gas available for deliveries. Natural gas is typically stored in underground storage facilities, including salt dome caverns, bedded salt caverns and depleted reservoirs. Storage facilities are most often utilized by pipeline companies to manage temporary imbalances in operations; natural gas end-users, such as LDCs, to manage the seasonality and variability of demand and to satisfy future natural gas needs; and, independent natural gas marketing and trading companies in connection with the execution of their trading strategies. 

Salt Manufacturing 

According to the United States Geological Survey, approximately 270 million metric tons of salt were produced in the world in 2015. Salt is generally categorized into four types based upon the method of production: evaporated salt, solar salt, rock salt and salt in brine. Dry salt is produced through the following methods: solution mining and mechanical evaporation, solar evaporation or deep-shaft mining. US Salt produces salt using solution mining and mechanical evaporation. In solution mining, wells are drilled into salt beds or domes and then water is injected into the formation and circulated to dissolve the salt. After salt is removed from a solution-mined salt deposit, the empty cavern can be used to store other substances, such as natural gas, NGLs or compressed air. 

The salt solution, or brine, is next pumped out of the cavern and taken to a processing plant for evaporation. The brine may be treated to remove minerals and then pumped into vacuum pans in which the brine is boiled, and evaporated until a salt slurry is created. The slurry is then dried and separated. Depending on the type of salt product to be produced, iodine and an anti-caking agent may be added to the salt. Most food grade table salt is produced in this manner. 

Competition 

Our G&#38;P operations compete for customers based on reputation, operating reliability and flexibility, price, creditworthiness, and service offerings, including interconnectivity to producer-desired takeaway options (e.g., processing facilities and pipelines). We face strong competition in acquiring new supplies in the production basins in which we operate, and competition customarily is impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region and fluctuations in 

commodity prices. Our primary competitors include other midstream companies with G&#38;P operations and producer-owned systems, and certain competitors enjoy first-mover advantages over us and may offer producers greater gathering and processing efficiencies, lower operating costs and more flexible commercial terms. 

Our NGL supply and logistics business competes primarily with integrated major oil companies, refiners and processors, and other energy companies that own or control transportation and storage assets that can be optimized for supply, marketing and logistics services. 

Natural gas storage and pipeline operators compete for customers primarily based on geographic location, which determines connectivity and proximity to supply sources and end-users, as well as price, operating reliability and flexibility, available capacity and service offerings. Our primary competitors in our natural gas storage market include other independent storage providers and major natural gas pipelines with storage capabilities embedded within their transmission systems. Our primary competitors in our natural gas transportation market include major natural gas pipelines and intrastate pipelines that can transport natural gas volumes between interstate systems. Long-haul pipelines often enjoy cost advantages over new pipeline projects with respect to options for delivering greater volumes to existing demand centers, and new projects and expansions proposed from time to time may serve the markets we serve and effectively displace the service we provide to customers. 

Our crude oil rail terminals primarily compete with crude oil pipelines and other midstream companies that own and operate rail terminals in the markets we serve. The crude oil logistics business is characterized by strong competition for supplies, and competition is based largely on customer service quality, pricing, and geographic proximity to customers and other market hubs. 

Our salt operations compete for customers primarily based on price and service. Because transportation costs are a material component of the costs borne by our customers, most of our customers are geographically located east of the Mississippi River. 

Regulation 

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, impacts our profitability. In general, midstream companies have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. 

Pipeline Safety 

We are subject to pipeline safety regulations imposed by the Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. Currently, all of our natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and all of our NGL and crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA as hazardous liquids pipelines under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). 

These federal statutes and PHMSA implementing regulations collectively impose numerous safety requirements on pipeline operators, such as the development of a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs. For example, pursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture could affect high-consequence areas, such as areas of high population and areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage. Integrity management programs require more frequent inspections and other preventative measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas. 

We plan to continue testing under our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Notwithstanding our preventive and investigatory maintenance efforts, we may incur significant expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or due to the implementation of more stringent pipeline safety standards resulting from new or amended legislation. For example, President Obama in January 2012 signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act), which requires increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids transportation pipelines. Among other things, the Pipeline Safety Act directs the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, testing to confirm the material strength 

of certain pipelines, and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day and also from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

Furthermore, PHMSA is considering changes to its natural gas transmission pipeline regulations to, among other things, expand the scope of high consequence areas, strengthen integrity management requirements applicable to existing operators; strengthen or expand non-integrity pipeline management standards relating to such matters as valve spacing, automatic or remotely-controlled valves, corrosion protection, and gathering lines; and add new regulations to govern the safety of underground natural gas storage facilities, including underground storage caverns and injection or withdrawal well piping that are not regulated today. We cannot predict the final outcome of these legislative or regulatory efforts or the precise impact that compliance with any resulting new safety requirements may have on our business. 

Future developments, such as stricter environmental laws or regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing requirements could directly affect our operations. For example, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced plans for the EPA to issue final standards in 2016 that would reduce methane emissions from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. In October 2015, the EPA reduced the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. State recommendations for area designations are due on October 1, 2016, and the EPA will finalize the designations by October 1, 2017. In matters that could have an indirect adverse effect on our business by decreasing demand for the services that we offer, the EPA and other federal and state agencies are conducting studies of potential adverse impacts that certain drilling methods (including hydraulic fracturing) may have on water quality and public health, whereas, Congress has considered, and several states have proposed or enacted, legislation or regulations imposing more stringent or costly requirements for exploration and production companies to develop and produce hydrocarbons. 

States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines, but most are certified by the Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate pipelines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. Our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements, and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. 

Natural Gas Storage and Transportation 

Our interstate natural gas storage and transportation operations are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act, and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries (Stagecoach Pipeline and Arlington Storage) are regulated by the FERC as natural gas companies. Under the Natural Gas Act, the FERC has authority to regulate gas transportation services in interstate commerce, which includes natural gas storage services. The FERC exercises jurisdiction over rates charged for services and the terms and conditions of service; the certification and construction of new facilities; the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; the maintenance of accounts and records; the acquisition and disposition of facilities; standards of conduct between affiliated entities; and various other matters. Regulated natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates determined by the FERC to be unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory, and both the existing tariff rates and the proposed rates of regulated natural gas companies are subject to challenge. 

The rates and terms and conditions of our natural gas storage and transportation services are found in the FERC-approved tariffs of (i) Stagecoach Pipeline, the owner of the Stagecoach facility, the North-South Facilities and the MARC I Pipeline, (ii) Arlington Storage, the owner of the Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben facilities, and (iii) Tres Palacios, the owner of the Tres Palacios facility. Stagecoach Pipeline, Arlington Storage and Tres Palacios are authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for storage services, and Stagecoach Pipeline is authorized to charge and collect negotiated rates for transportation services. Market-based and negotiated rate authority allows us to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand, which we then make public. A loss of market-based or negotiated rate authority or any successful complaint or protest against the rates charged or provided by Stagecoach Pipeline or Arlington Storage could have an adverse impact on our revenues. 

In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act to (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules, regulations and orders, up to $1 million per day per violation. 

Our interstate natural gas storage operations are also subject to non-rate regulation by various state agencies. For example, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has jurisdiction over well drilling, conversion and plugging in New York. The NYSDEC therefore regulates aspects of our Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben natural gas storage facilities. 

Our intrastate pipeline in New York (the East Pipeline) is subject to lightened regulation under NYPSC regulations and policies. Lightened regulation generally exempts us from NYPSC regulation applicable to the provision of retail service. CPE, as the owner and operator of the East Pipeline, remains subject to limited corporate (e.g., obtaining approval prior to any transfer of its ownership interests or the issuance of debt securities) and operational and safety (e.g., filing of vegetation management plan) regulation established and maintained by the NYPSC. 

Natural Gas Gathering 

Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC. 

States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply, and they generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas. 

The states in which we operate gathering systems have adopted a form of complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering operations, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. To date, these regulations have not had an adverse effect on our systems. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future, and failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. 

In Texas, we have filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) to establish rates and terms of service for certain of our pipelines. Our assets in Texas include intrastate common carrier NGL pipelines subject to the regulation of the TRCC, which requires that our NGL pipelines file tariff publications that contain all the rules and regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform. NGL pipeline rates may be limited to provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services. 

NGL Storage 

Our NGL storage terminals are subject primarily to state and local regulation. For example, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INDNR) and the NYSDEC have jurisdiction over the underground storage of NGLs and well drilling, conversion and plugging in Indiana and New York, respectively. Thus, the INDNR regulates aspects of our Seymour facility, and the NYSDEC regulates aspects of the Bath facility and our proposed storage facility near Watkins Glen. 

We filed an application with the NYSDEC in October 2009 for an underground storage permit for our Watkins Glen NGL storage development project. The agency issued a Positive Declaration for the project in November 2010, determined in August 2011 that the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement we submitted for the project was complete, and held public hearings on the project in September and November 2011. In early 2012, based on concerns expressed by interested stakeholders and conversations with NYSDEC staff, we informed the agency that we would reduce our environmental footprint and modified our brine pond design. In September 2012, we submitted to the NYSDEC final drawings and plans for our revised project design. In August 2014, the NYDEC announced that it would convene an issues conference to determine if there are any significant issues that require an adjudicatory hearing. The issues conference was held in mid-February 2015, and we are awaiting a ruling from the presiding administrative law judge on whether additional hearings are required for any of the technical issues addressed at the issues conference. We continue to pursue the approvals required to construct our proposed NGL storage facility near Watkins Glen, New York but we cannot predict with certainty if and when the permitting process will be concluded. 

Crude Oil Transportation 

The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an interstate basis is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. The ICA and FERC regulations also require that such rates be just and reasonable, and to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner and to not confer undue preference upon any shipper. The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an intrastate is subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Intrastate common carriers must also offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. Our crude oil pipelines in North Dakota are not common carrier pipelines and, therefore, are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC or any state regulatory commission. 

Certain of our crude oil operations located in North Dakota are subject to state regulation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). For example, gas conditioning requirements established by the NDIC recently will require operators of crude by rail terminals to report to the NDIC any crude volumes received for loading that exceed federal vapor pressure limits. State legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would authorize and require the NDIC to promulgate regulations under which produced water pipelines would be required to, among other things, install leak detection facilities and post bonds to cover potential remediation costs associated with releases. Moreover, the regulation of our customers' production activities by the NDIC impacts our operations. For example, on July 1, 2014, the NDIC issued an order pursuant to which the agency adopted legally enforceable &#8220;gas capture percentage goals&#8221; targeting the capture of certain percentages of natural gas produced in the state by specified dates. Exploration and production operators in the state may be required to install new equipment to satisfy these goals, and any failure by operators subject to the legal requirements to meet these gas capture percentage goals would subject those operators to production restrictions, which developments could reduce the amount of commodities we gather on the Arrow system from those operators who are our customers and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 

Portions of our Arrow gathering system, which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, are subject to regulation by the Mandan, Hidatsa &#38; Arikara Nation (MHA Nation). An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations applies to operators and other parties within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the EPA, together with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American reservations. These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, Tribal employment contractor preferences and numerous other matters. 

Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM. However, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation and has the right to enact and enforce certain other laws and regulations entirely independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations, as long as they do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations include various fees, taxes, requirements to employ Native 

American tribal members or use tribal owned service businesses and numerous other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations within the boundaries of a Native American reservation. Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation are often subject to the Native American tribal court system, unless there is a specific waiver of sovereign immunity by the Native American tribe allowing resolution of disputes between the Native American tribe and those lessees or operators to occur in federal or state court. 

We are therefore subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these Native American requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits necessary to operate on tribal lands pursuant to these regulations, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project on those lands. 

PHMSA is currently reviewing the adequacy of Bakken crude laboratory testing measures used to determine the packaging group selection for shipment of crude by rail. PHMSA's objective is to confirm that crude being offered for shipment by rail has been properly classified and characterized to ensure the safe transport to end users. We, as the owner of a Bakken crude loading terminal, are providing input as this review process progresses through multiple agencies and organizations. 

Supply and Logistics 

The transportation of crude oil and NGLs by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations, which are administered by the DOT, cover the transportation of hazardous materials. 

IRS Audit 

On April 9, 2015, the IRS completed their examination of our 2011 partnership tax return and issued a No Adjustment Letter to us. 

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 

Our operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge and emission of pollutants into the environment, environmental protection, or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on our operations, including the need to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; apply workplace health and safety standards for the benefit of employees; require remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the development of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the activities in a particular area. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing federal environmental laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject: 

&#8226; 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes strict liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur; 

&#8226; 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes; 

&#8226; 

The Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements; 

&#8226; 

The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters; 

&#8226; 

The Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation's public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of substances into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources; 

&#8226; 

The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments and more detailed Environmental Impact Statements that may be made available for public review and comment; 

&#8226; 

The Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and 

&#8226; 

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures. 

Certain of these environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Accordingly, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up or remediating contamination arising out of our operations or as a result of activities by others who previously occupied or operated on properties now owned or leased by us. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease and facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We may not be able to recover some or any of these additional costs from insurance. 

During 2014, we experienced three releases on our Arrow produced water gathering system. Approximately 28,000 barrels of produced water were released on lands within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. We have substantially completed our remediation efforts for the 2014 spills subject to approval by the MHA Nation and the applicable regulatory agencies. In May 2015, we experienced a release of approximately 5,200 barrels of produced water on our Arrow water gathering system. We have also notified our insurance carriers of the releases under our environmental policies and we believe our remediation costs will be recoverable under our insurance policies. 

In October 2014, we received data requests from the EPA related to the 2014 water releases, and we responded to the requests during the first half of 2015. In April 2015, the EPA issued a Notice of Potential Violation (NOPV) under the Clean Water Act relating to the 2014 water releases. We responded to the NOPV in May 2015, and have commenced settlement discussion with the EPA concerning the NOPV. On March 3, 2015, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office in Bismarck, North Dakota, seeking documents and information relating to the largest of the three 2014 water releases, and we provided the requested information during the second quarter of 2015. In August 2015, we received a notice of violation from the Three Affiliated Tribes' Environmental Division related to our 2014 produced water releases on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The notice of violation imposes fines and requests reimbursements exceeding $1.1 million; however, the notice of violation was stayed on September 15, 2015, upon our posting of a performance bond for the amount contemplated by the notice and pending the outcome of ongoing settlement discussions with the regulatory agencies asserting jurisdiction over the 2014 produced water releases. We cannot predict what the outcome of these investigations will be. 

We own a propane storage and distribution facility in Seymour, Indiana. On May 15, 2014, the EPA issued a request relating to our compliance with the chemical accident prevention provision at the facility. We responded to the request on August 6, 2014, and at EPA&#8217;s request, we submitted additional documentation of compliance on January 30, 2015. We entered into a consent agreement and final order with the EPA and paid a civil penalty of approximately $0.3 million in December 2015. 

Employees 

As of February 1, 2016, we had 1,300 full-time employees, 302 of which were general and administrative employees and 998 of which were operational. As of February 1, 2016, US Salt had 126 employees, 99 of which are members of a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees (including union labor) is satisfactory.
