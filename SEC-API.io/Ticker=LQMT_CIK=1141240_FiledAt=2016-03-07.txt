Overview 

&#160; 

We are a materials technology and manufacturing company that develops and commercializes products made from amorphous alloys. Our Liquidmetal&#174; family of alloys consists of a variety of proprietary bulk alloys and composites that utilize the advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology. We design, develop, manufacture, and sell products and custom components from bulk amorphous alloys to customers in a wide range of industries. We also partner with third-party manufacturers and licensees to develop and commercialize Liquidmetal alloy products. 

&#160; 

Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of our alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. Our alloys and the injection molding technology we employ result in components that exhibit: exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. Interestingly, all of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics, as is the case with crystalline materials. We believe these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium, stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a variety of applications. Moreover, we believe these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials.

General Corporate Information 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated in California in 1987, and we reincorporated in Delaware in May 2003. Our principal executive office is located at 30452 Esperanza, Rancho Santa Margarita, California 92688. Our telephone number at that address is (949) 635-2100. Our Internet website address is www.liquidmetal.com and all of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) are available free of charge on our website. 

&#160; 

Our Technology &#160; 

&#160; 

The performance, processing, and potential cost advantages of Liquidmetal alloys are a function of their unique atomic structure and their proprietary material composition. 

&#160; 

Unique Atomic Structure 

&#160; 

The atomic structure of Liquidmetal alloys is the fundamental feature that differentiates them from other alloys and metals. In the molten state, the atomic particles of all alloys and metals have an amorphous atomic structure, which means that the atomic particles appear in a completely random structure with no discernible patterns. However, when non-amorphous alloys and metals are cooled to a solid state, their atoms bond together in a repeating pattern of regular and predictable shapes or crystalline grains. This process is analogous to the way ice forms when water freezes and crystallizes. In non-amorphous metals and alloys, the individual crystalline grains contain naturally occurring structural defects that limit the potential strength and performance characteristics of the material. These defects, known as dislocations, consist of discontinuities or inconsistencies in the patterned atomic structure of each grain. Unlike other alloys and metals, bulk Liquidmetal alloys can retain their amorphous atomic structure throughout the solidification process and therefore do not develop crystalline grains and the associated dislocations. Consequently, bulk Liquidmetal alloys exhibit superior strength and other superior performance characteristics compared to their crystalline counterparts. 

&#160; 

Prior to 1993, commercially viable amorphous alloys could be created only in thin forms, such as coatings, films, or ribbons. However, in 1993, researchers at the California Institute of Technology (&#8220;Caltech&#8221;) developed the first commercially viable amorphous alloy in a bulk form. We obtained the exclusive right to commercialize the bulk amorphous alloy through a license agreement with Caltech and have developed the technology to enable the commercialization of bulk amorphous alloys. 

&#160; 

Proprietary Material Composition &#160; 

&#160; 

The constituent elements and percentage composition of Liquidmetal alloys are critical to their ability to solidify into an amorphous atomic structure. We have several different alloy compositions that have different constituent elements in varying percentages. The raw materials that we use in Liquidmetal alloys are readily available and can be purchased from multiple suppliers. 

&#160; 

Advantages of Liquidmetal Alloys &#160; 

&#160; 

Liquidmetal alloys possess a unique combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe makes them superior in many ways to other commercially available materials for a variety of existing and potential future product applications. The unique combined process results of precise dimensional control and repeatability, surface finish, strength, hardness, elasticity, and corrosion resistance are uncommon in crystalline material alternatives. Additionally, the ability to leverage injection molding processes and related tooling technologies provides the ability to deliver a broad range of material characteristics in a complex shaped component. 

&#160; 

Performance Advantages &#160; 

&#160; 

Our bulk Liquidmetal alloys provide several distinct performance advantages over other materials, and we believe that these advantages make the alloys desirable in applications that require high precision and repeatability, high yield strength, strength-to-weight ratio, elasticity, corrosion resistance and hardness. 

&#160; 

The comparatively high yield strength of bulk Liquidmetal alloys means that a very high amount of stress must be exerted to cause the material to fail. However, because the yield strength is so high, the yield strength of many of our Liquidmetal alloys&#8217; compositions is very near their ultimate strength, which is the measure of stress at which plastic deformation occurs. Therefore, very little additional stress may be required to break an object made of bulk Liquidmetal alloys once the yield strength is exceeded. Although we believe that the yield strength of many of our bulk alloys exceeds the ultimate strength of most other commonly used alloys and metals, our bulk alloys may not be suitable for certain applications, such as pressurized tanks, in which the ability of the material to yield significantly before it breaks is more important than its strength advantage. Additionally, although our bulk alloys show high resistance to crack initiation because of their very high strength and hardness, specific bulk alloys are sensitive to crack propagation under certain long-term, cyclical loading conditions. Crack propagation is the tendency of a crack to grow after it forms. We continue to develop new alloy compositions that have improved material properties to overcome these limitations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Processing Advantages &#160; 

&#160; 

The processing of a material generally refers to how a material is shaped, formed, or combined with other materials to create a finished product. Bulk Liquidmetal alloys possess processing characteristics that we believe make them preferable to other materials in a wide variety of applications. In particular, our alloys are amenable to processing options that are similar in many respects to those associated with plastics. Additionally, unlike most metals and alloys, our bulk Liquidmetal alloys are capable of being thermoplastically molded in bulk form. Thermoplastic molding consists of heating a solid piece of material until it is transformed into a moldable state, although at temperatures much lower than the melting temperature, and then introducing it into a mold to form near-to-net shaped products. Accordingly, thermoplastic molding can be beneficial and economical for net-shape fabrication of high-strength products. Liquidmetal alloys also have superior net-shape casting capabilities as compared to high-strength crystalline metals and alloys. &#8220;Net-shape casting&#8221; is a type of casting that permits the creation of near-to-net shaped products that reduce costly post-cast processing or machining. 

&#160; 

Bulk Liquidmetal alloys also permit the creation of composite materials that cannot be created with most non-amorphous metals and alloys. A composite is a material that is made from two or more different types of materials. In general, the ability to create composites is beneficial because constituent materials can be combined with one another to optimize the composite&#8217;s performance characteristics for different applications. In other metals and alloys, the high temperatures required for processing could damage some of the composite&#8217;s constituent materials and therefore limit their utility. However, the relatively low melting temperatures of bulk Liquidmetal alloys allow mild processing conditions that eliminate or limit damage to the constituent materials when creating composites. In addition to composites, we believe that the processing advantages of Liquidmetal alloys will ultimately allow for a variety of other finished forms, including sheets and extrusions. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing advantages, our bulk Liquidmetal alloys possess certain limitations relative to processing. The beneficial processing features of our bulk alloys are made possible in part by the alloys&#8217; relatively low melting temperatures. Although a lower melting temperature is a beneficial characteristic for processing purposes, it renders certain bulk alloy compositions unsuitable for certain high-temperature applications, such as jet engine exhaust components. Additionally, the current one-inch thickness limitation of our zirconium-titanium bulk alloy renders our alloys currently unsuitable for use as structural materials in large-scale applications, such as load-bearing beams in building construction. We continue to engage in research and development with the goal of developing processing technology and new alloy compositions that will enable our bulk alloys to be formed into thicker objects. 

&#160; 

Cost Advantages &#160; 

&#160; 

Liquidmetal alloys have the potential to provide cost advantages over other high-strength metals and alloys in certain applications. Because bulk Liquidmetal alloys have processing characteristics similar in some respects to plastics, which lend themselves to near-to-net shape molding, Liquidmetal alloys can in many cases be shaped efficiently into intricate, engineered products. This capability can eliminate or reduce certain post-molding steps, such as machining and re-forming, and therefore has the potential to significantly reduce processing costs associated with making parts in high volume. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

The key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Focusing Our Marketing Activities on Select Products with Optimized Gross-Margins. We have focused and continue to focus our marketing activities on select products with optimized gross margins for the long term . This strategy is designed to align our product development initiatives with our processes and cost structure, and to reduce our exposure to more commodity-type product applications that are prone to unpredictable demand and fluctuating pricing. Our focus is primarily on products that possess design features that take advantage of our existing and developing manufacturing technology and that command a price commensurate with the performance advantages of our alloys. In addition , we will continue to engage in prototype manufacturing, both for internally manufactured products and for products that will ultimately be licensed to or manufactured by ourselves and/or third parties. &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Pursuing Strategic Partnerships in Order to More Rapidly Develop and Commercialize Products . We have and continue to actively pursue and support strategic partnerships that will enable us to leverage the resources, strength, and technologies of other companies in order to more rapidly develop and commercialize products. These partnerships may include licensing transactions in which we license full commercial rights to our technology in a specific application area, or they may include transactions of a more limited scope in which, for example, we outsource manufacturing activities or grant limited licensing rights. We believe that utilizing such a partnering strategy will enable us to reduce our working capital burden, better fund product development efforts, better understand customer adoption practices, leverage the technical and financial resources of our partners, and more effectively handle product design and process challenges. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Advancing the Liquidmetal&#174; Brand . We believe that building our corporate brand will foster continued adoption of our technology. Our goal is to position Liquidmetal alloys as a superior substitute for materials currently used in a variety of products across a range of industries. Furthermore, we seek to establish Liquidmetal alloys as an enabling technology that will facilitate the creation of a broad range of commercially viable new products. To enhance industry awareness of our company and increase demand for Liquidmetal alloys, we are engaged in various brand development strategies that could include collaborative advertising and promotional campaigns with select customers, industry conference and trade show appearances, public relations, and other means. 

&#160; 

Applications for Liquidmetal Alloys 

&#160; 

There are a very broad number of markets where Liquidmetal alloys have application opportunities. Some of the more prominent markets include: aerospace, automotive, defense, medical/dental, non-consumer electronics, and sporting equipment. We believe that these areas are consistent with our strategy in terms of market size, building brand recognition, and providing an opportunity to develop and refine our processing capabilities. Although we believe that strategic partnership transactions could also create valuable opportunities beyond the parameters of these target markets, we anticipate continuing to pursue these markets both internally and in conjunction with partners. 

&#160; 

Medical Devices 

&#160; 

We are engaged in product development efforts relating to various medical devices that could be made from bulk Liquidmetal alloys. We believe that the unique properties of bulk Liquidmetal alloys provide a combination of performance and cost benefits that could make them a desirable replacement for incumbent materials, such as machined stainless steel and titanium, or components made from other more traditional metalworking technologies currently used in various medical device applications. Our ongoing emphasis has been on minimally invasive surgical instrument applications for Liquidmetal alloys. These include, but are not limited to, specialized blades, clamps, tissue suturing components, tissue manipulation devices and orthopedic instruments utilized for implant surgery procedures, dental devices, and general surgery devices. The potential value offered by our alloys is higher performance in some cases and cost reduction in others, the latter stemming from the ability of Liquidmetal alloys to be net shape molded into components, thus reducing costs of secondary processing common with other metalworking processes. The status of most components in the prototyping phase is subject to non-disclosure agreements with our customers. 

&#160; 

We believe that our prospects for success in this market will be enhanced through our focus on validating our materials through standardized industry tests such as the ASTM 10993 biocompatibility tests, optimizing existing alloy compositions and developing new alloy compositions to satisfy the industry&#8217;s rigorous material performance standards. 

&#160; 

Components for Non-Consumer Electronic Products 

&#160; 

We design, develop and produce components for non-consumer electronic devices utilizing our bulk Liquidmetal alloys and believe that our alloys offer enhanced performance and design benefits for these components in certain applications. Our strategic focus is primarily on parts that command a price commensurate with the performance advantages of our alloys. These product categories in the non-consumer electronics field include, but are not limited to, aerospace components, defense parts, medical devices, sporting goods, leisure products, automotive components and industrial machines. We believe that there are multiple applications and opportunities in the non-consumer electronics product category for us to produce parts that command the higher margin and premium prices consistent with our core business strategy. 

&#160; 

We believe that the continued miniaturization of, and the introduction of advanced features to non-consumer electronic devices is a primary driver of growth, market share, and profits in our industry. The high strength-to-weight ratio and elastic limit, along with the processing advantages of bulk Liquidmetal alloys enable the production of smaller, thinner, but stronger electronic parts. We also believe that the strength characteristics of our alloys could facilitate the creation of a new generation of non-consumer electronic devices which currently may not be viable because of strength limitations of conventional metal parts in the marketplace today. Lastly, we believe that our alloys offer style and design flexibility, such as shiny metallic finishes, to accommodate the changing tastes of our customers. 

&#160; 

On August 5, 2010, we entered into a license transaction with Apple Inc. (&#8220;Apple&#8221;) pursuant to which , for a one time license fee, we granted to Apple a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize our intellectual property in the field of &#8220;consumer electronic&#8221; products, as defined in the license agreement. As a result, we will not pursue application of our bulk Liquidmetal alloys in the consumer electronics field. However, we continue to work with Apple to develop and advance research and development in the amorphous alloy space to benefit both consumer and non-consumer electronics fields. For more information regarding our transaction with Apple, see &#8220; &#8211; Licensing Transactions&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Aerospace and Defense 

&#160; 

We design and develop components for aerospace and defense customers to meet their requirements for complex, high strength parts with precision tolerances through our near net-shape molding process. Some of the parts we have developed cannot be made by any other conventional fabrication process, offering designers of high performance, mission critical systems unique alternatives. 

&#160; 

Because of the high degree of uniformity and consistency of our volume molding process, we are able to reduce significant costs associated with machining and verifying the dimensional tolerances of high precision parts and post-fabrication steps required to apply highly polished surfaces. Additional key properties for the aerospace and defense market are Liquidmetal alloy&#8217;s tensile strength, hardness, wear resistance, resistance to corrosion, and Liquidmetal alloy&#8217;s unique properties associated with explosives and munitions. 

&#160; 

The many high value and specialized applications within the aerospace and defense industry present significant opportunities for our technology and solutions, and as they are designed into key systems, will provide us with potential long-term revenue streams. 

&#160; 

Sporting Goods and Leisure Products 

&#160; 

We are developing a variety of applications for Liquidmetal alloys in the sporting goods and leisure products area. 

&#160; 

In the sporting goods industry, we believe that the high strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, and elasticity of our bulk alloys have the potential to enhance performance in a variety of products including , but not limited to , golf clubs, tennis rackets, archery, sporting arms and scuba equipment. We further believe that many sporting goods products are conducive to our strategy of focusing on high-margin products that meet our design criteria. 

&#160; 

In the leisure products category, we believe that bulk Liquidmetal alloys can be used to efficiently produce intricately engineered designs with high-quality finishes, such as premium watchcases and knives. We further believe that Liquidmetal technology can be used to make high-quality, high-strength jewelry from precious metals. 

&#160; 

Licensing Transactions 

&#160; 

Apple License Transaction 

&#160; 

On August 5, 2010, the Company entered into a license transaction with Apple Inc. (&#8220;Apple&#8221;) pursuant to which (i) the Company contributed substantially all of its intellectual property assets to a newly organized special-purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary, called Crucible Intellectual Property, LLC (&#8220;CIP&#8221;), (ii) CIP granted to Apple a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize such intellectual property in the field of consumer electronic products, as defined in the license agreement, in exchange for a license fee, and (iii) CIP granted back to the Company a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize such intellectual property in all other fields of use. 

&#160; 

Under the agreements relating to the license transaction with Apple, the Company was obligated to contribute, to CIP, all intellectual property that it developed through February 2012. Subsequently, this obligation has been extended to apply to all intellectual property developed through February 2016. The Company is also obligated to maintain certain limited liability company formalities with respect to CIP at all times after the closing of the license transaction. 

&#160; 

V isser Precision Cast, LLC License Transaction 

&#160; 

On June 1, 2012, the Company entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the &#8220;Visser MTA&#8221;) with Visser Precision Cast, LLC (&#8220;Visser&#8221;) relating to a strategic transaction for manufacturing services and financing. Under the manufacturing and service component of the Visser MTA, the Company agreed to engage Visser as a perpetual, exclusive manufacturer of non-consumer electronic products. Under the financing component of the Visser MTA, the Company issued and sold to Visser in a private placement transaction (i) 30,000,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.10 per share resulting in proceeds of $3,000,000 and (ii) two warrants to purchase 15,000,000 shares of common stock at an original exercise price of $0.22 per share which expire on June 1, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

On May 20, 2014, the Company and Visser entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties have amended and restated the sublicense and financing components of the Visser MTA. Additionally, the manufacturing services component and remaining considerations of the Visser MTA were terminated. Under the amended and restated sublicense agreement, the Company granted to Visser a fully paid-up, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-transferable, nonexclusive sublicense to all of the Company&#8217;s intellectual property developed on or prior to May 20, 2014 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), for all fields of use other than certain excluded fields as set forth therein. Visser does not have any rights, now or in the future, to the Company&#8217;s intellectual property developed after the Effective Date. The license to the Company&#8217;s intellectual property developed on or prior to the Effective Date does not include the right to use the &#8220;Liquidmetal&#8221; trademark or any of the Company&#8217;s other trademarks, except in certain defined situations, as set forth in the amended and restated agreement. 

&#160; 

With the foregoing revised arrangements, the Company is no longer required to use Visser as its exclusive manufacturer and is free to license other manufacturers on a non-exclusive basis in any industry or geographic market as to which the Company has not previously granted an exclusive license to a third party. Any such manufacturers licensed by the Company in the future will be able both to manufacture parts for the Company and its customers , and to manufacture and sell products for their own account for such industries or markets as the Company may agree, subject to whatever royalty arrangements the Company may negotiate. The Company has not yet licensed any manufacturers other than Visser. Visser will also have the right to manufacture and sell products under the amended and restated sublicense agreement. 

&#160; 

The settlement amended and restated the two warrants the Company issued to Visser in June 2012 to purchase 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.22 per share. Those warrants contained anti-dilution mechanisms under which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of those warrants would be increased, and the exercise price for such shares would be reduced if we issued shares of our common stock at prices less than the warrants&#8217; exercise price. The amended and restated warrant agreement includes the effect of such anti-dilution adjustments and is exercisable for 18,611,079 shares of common stock (increased further to 18,937,931 shares under the anti-dilution provisions of the warrants, see footnote 14) at an exercise price of $0.17 per share. The amended and restated warrant agreement continues to contain comparable anti-dilution adjustment mechanisms. The amended and restated warrant agreement also removes certain lock-up provisions that were included in the original warrants. These warrants expire on June 1, 2017. 

&#160; 

Other License Transactions 

&#160; 

On January 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Supply and License Agreement for a five year term with Engel Austria Gmbh (&#8220;Engel&#8221;) whereby Engel was granted a non-exclusive license to manufacture and sell injection molding machines to the Company&#8217;s licensees. Since that time, the Company and Engel have agreed on an injection molding machine configuration that can be commercially supplied and supported by Engel. On December 6, 2013, the companies entered into an Exclusive License Agreement for a 10 year term whereby Engel was granted an exclusive license to manufacture and sell injection molding machines to the Company&#8217;s licensees in exchange for certain royalties to be paid by Engel to the Company based on a percentage of the net sales price of such injection molding machines.

The Company will receive royalty payments over the life of the contract on all Liquidmetal products produced and sold by Swatch. The license agreement with Swatch will expire on the expiration date of the last licensed patent. 

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Pursuant to our transaction with Apple described under &#8220;Licensing Transactions&#8221; above, we license substantially all our intellectual property from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crucible Intellectual Property, LLC. Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks. Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business, and we intend to vigorously protect our patents and other intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 86 owned or licensed U.S. patents and 58 patent applications pending relating to the composition, processing, and application of our alloys, as well as various foreign counterpart patents and patent applications. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our initial bulk amorphous alloy technology was developed by researchers at the California Institute of Technology (&#8220;Caltech&#8221;). We have acquired patent rights that provide us with the exclusive right to commercialize the amorphous alloys and other amorphous alloy technology developed at Caltech through a license agreement (&#8220;Caltech License Agreement&#8221;) with Caltech. In addition to the patents and patent applications that we license from Caltech, we are building a portfolio of our own patents to expand and enhance our technology position. These patents and patent applications primarily relate to various applications of our bulk amorphous alloys and the processing of our alloys. The patents expire on various dates between 2016 and 2035. Our policy is to seek patent protection for all technology, inventions, and improvements that are of commercial importance to the development of our business, except to the extent that we believe it is advisable to maintain such technology or invention as a trade secret. 

&#160; 

In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary technical and business information, we require that all of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of information that is deemed confidential. The agreements also obligate our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign to us developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. 

&#160; 

Research and Development &#160; 

&#160; 

We are engaged in ongoing research and development programs that are driven by the following key objectives: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Enhance Material Processing and Manufacturing Efficiencies. We are working with our strategic partners to enhance material processing and manufacturing efficiencies. We plan to continue research and development of processes and compositions that will decrease our cost of making products from Liquidmetal alloys. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Optimize Existing Alloys and Develop New Compositions. We believe that one of the key technology drivers of our business will continue to be our proprietary alloy compositions. We plan to continue research and development on new alloy compositions to generate a broader class of amorphous alloys with a wider range of specialized performance characteristics. We believe that our ability to optimize our existing alloy compositions will enable us to better tailor our alloys to our customers&#8217; specific application requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

Develop New Applications. We will continue the research and development of new applications for Liquidmetal alloys. We believe the range of potential applications will broaden as we expand the forms, compositions, and methods of processing of our alloys. 

&#160; 

We conduct our research and development programs internally, as well as through strategic relationships with third parties. Currently, our internal research and development efforts are conducted by a team of nine scientists, engineers, and technicians each of whom we either employ directly or engage as a consultant. 

&#160; 

In addition to our internal research and development efforts, we enter into cooperative research and development relationships with leading academic institutions. We have entered into development relationships with other companies for the purpose of identifying new applications for our alloys and establishing customer relationships with such companies. Some of our product development programs are partially funded by our customers. We are also engaged in negotiations with other potential customers regarding possible product development relationships. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials &#160; 

&#160; 

Liquidmetal alloy compositions are comprised of many elements, all of which are generally available commodity products. We believe that each of these raw materials is readily available in sufficient quantities from multiple sources on commercially acceptable terms. However, any substantial increase in the price or interruption in the supply of these materials could have an adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing &#160; 

&#160; 

During 2015 we continued to expand on the development of our Manufacturing Center of Excellence, which will allow (i) on-site manufacturing of customer products and (ii) our customers and strategic partners to inspect, collaborate, and demonstrate the latest developments of our alloy composition development and manufacturing processes. As part of these efforts, we received our ISO 9001:2008 certification during 2015 as further validation of our on-site processes and focus on product quality. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In addition, our current manufacturing strategy is to partner with global companies that are contract manufacturers and alloy producers. We seek third party companies with proven track records of success and that can gain specialized skills and knowledge of our alloys through close collaborations with our team of scientists and engineers. We believe that partnering with these global companies will allow us to forgo the capital intensive requirements of maintaining our own large scale manufacturing facilities and allow us to grow the number of applications for the technology much faster than could be accomplished on our own. 

&#160; 

Customers &#160;

During 2015, there were three major customers, who together accounted for 52% of our revenue. During 2014, there were four major customers, who together accounted for 84% of our revenue. During 2013, there was one major customer, who accounted for 80% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2015, three customers represented 100%, or $30,000, of the total outstanding trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2014, two customers represented 100%, or $83,000, of the total outstanding trade accounts receivable. In the future, we expect that a significant portion of our revenue may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of customers, even if our bulk alloys business grows. 

&#160; 

Competition &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe it would be difficult to develop, manufacture, or sell bulk amorphous alloys, or products made from bulk amorphous alloy, without infringing our patents. However, our bulk Liquidmetal alloys face competition from other materials, including metals, alloys, plastics and composites, which are currently used in the commercial applications that we pursue. For example, we face significant competition from plastics, zinc and stainless steel in our non-consumer electronics components business, and titanium and composites will continue to be used widely in medical devices and sporting goods. Many of these competitive materials are produced by domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Based on our experience developing products for a variety of customers, we believe that the selection of materials by potential customers will continue to be product-specific in nature, with the decision for each product being driven primarily by the performance needs of the application and, secondarily, by cost considerations and design flexibility. Because of the relatively high strength of our alloys, dimensional precision, and the design flexibility of our process, we are most competitive when the customer is seeking a higher strength, as well as greater design flexibility, than currently available with other materials. However, if currently available materials, such as plastics, are strong enough for the application, our alloys are often not competitive in those applications with respect to price. We also believe that our alloys are generally not competitive with the cost of some of the basic metals, such as steel, aluminum or copper, when such basic metals can be processed by simple traditional metalworking processes into shapes and components that are satisfactory for their intended applications. Our alloys are generally more competitive with respect to price compared to components machined from various metals, such as titanium, stainless steel and other higher performance crystalline metals. Our alloys could also face competition from new materials that may be developed in the future, including new materials that could render our alloys obsolete. 

&#160; 

We experience and will continue to experience indirect competition from the competitors of our customers. Because we rely on our customers to market and sell finished goods that incorporate our components or products, our success will depend in part on the ability of our customers to effectively market and sell their own products and compete in their respective markets. 

&#160; 

Backlog &#160; 

&#160; 

Because of the minimal lead-time associated with orders of bulk alloy parts, we generally do not carry a significant backlog. The backlog as of any particular date gives no indication of actual sales for any succeeding period. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing &#160; 

&#160; 

We direct our marketing efforts towards customers that will incorporate our components and products into their finished goods. Our goal is to educate customers on the benefits of our technology and help them gain adequate knowledge to apply the technology to their upcoming product application designs. To that end, we have business development personnel who, in conjunction with engineers and scientists, will actively identify potential customers that may be able to benefit from the introduction of Liquidmetal alloys to their products. We currently have 4 full-time employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Additionally, we have expanded our outside sales forces to complement our internal team, as evidenced through the continued partnering with territorial market sales representatives. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 23 full-time employees. As of that date, none of our employees were represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our employee relations to be favorable.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Governmental Regulation &#160; 

&#160; 

Government regulation of our products will depend on the nature and type of product and the jurisdictions in which the products are sold. For example, medical instruments incorporating our Liquidmetal alloys will be subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Medical device manufacturers to whom we intend to sell our products may need to obtain FDA approval before marketing their medical devices that incorporate our products and may need to obtain similar approvals before marketing these medical device products in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

Environmental Law Compliance 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to national, state, and local environmental laws in the United States . We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. While we continue to incur costs to comply with environmental regulations, we do not believe that such costs will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. 

&#160; 

Golf Subsidiary 

&#160; 

From 1997 until September 2001, we were engaged in the retail marketing and sale of golf clubs through a majority -owned subsidiary, Liquidmetal Golf. The retail business of Liquidmetal Golf was discontinued in September 2001. However, in December 2012, we recommenced activities and discussions with potential partners regarding the development of golf club components for golf original equipment manufacturers that will integrate these components into their own clubs and then sell them under their respective brand names. Such activities continued through 2015. Liquidmetal Technologies owns 79% of the outstanding common stock in Liquidmetal Golf. 

&#160; 

Our Liquidmetal Golf subsidiary has the exclusive right and license to utilize our Liquidmetal alloy technology for purposes of golf equipment applications. This right and license is set forth in an intercompany license agreement between Liquidmetal Technologies and Liquidmetal Golf. This license agreement provides that Liquidmetal Golf has a perpetual and exclusive license to use Liquidmetal alloy technology for the purpose of manufacturing, marketing, and selling golf club components and other products used in the sport of golf. In consideration of this license, Liquidmetal Golf has issued 4,500,000 shares of Liquidmetal Golf common stock to Liquidmetal Technologies, which comprises Liquidmetal Technologies&#8217; 79% ownership interest in Liquidmetal Golf.
