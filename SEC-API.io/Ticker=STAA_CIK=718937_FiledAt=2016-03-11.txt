 Item 1. Business

&#160;

STAAR Surgical Company designs, develops, manufactures and sells implantable lenses for the eye and delivery systems used to deliver the lenses into the eye. We are the leading maker of lenses used worldwide in corrective or &#8220;refractive&#8221; surgery. Our goal is to position our refractive lenses throughout the world as primary and premium solutions for patients seeking visual freedom from wearing glasses or contact lenses while achieving excellent visual acuity through refractive vision correction. We also make lenses for use in surgery that treats cataracts.

&#160;

Originally incorporated in California in 1982, STAAR Surgical Company reincorporated in Delaware in 1986. Unless the context indicates otherwise, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; and &#8220;STAAR&#8221; refer to STAAR Surgical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.

A glossary explaining many of the technical terms used in this report begins on page 14. The reader may also find it helpful to refer to the discussion of the structure and function of the human eye that begins on page 7.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

STAAR has significant operations globally. Activities outside the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) accounted for 86% of our total sales in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to the pacing of product approvals and commercialization that tend to occur first outside the U.S. STAAR sells its products in more than 60 countries, with direct distribution in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, the U.K. and Spain, and independent distribution in the remainder of the world.

&#160;

STAAR maintains operational and administrative facilities in the U.S., Switzerland and Japan. Its current global operations are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; United States. STAAR operates its global administrative headquarters and principal manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California. The Monrovia manufacturing facility primarily makes the Visian implantable Collamer lenses (ICLs), Collamer and silicone intraocular lenses (IOLs), preloaded silicone IOLs, and injector systems. We manufacture the raw material for Collamer lenses (both IOLs and ICLs) and the AquaFlow Device (for the treatment of glaucoma) in our facility in Aliso Viejo, California. &#160;

&#183; Switzerland . STAAR operates an administrative and distribution facility in Nidau, Switzerland under its wholly owned subsidiary, STAAR Surgical AG. The Nidau facility also maintains manufacturing capabilities for STAAR&#8217;s ICL products and the AquaFlow Device. &#160;

&#183; Japan . STAAR operates administrative and distribution facilities in Japan under its wholly owned subsidiary, STAAR Japan Inc. STAAR Japan&#8217;s administrative facility is located in Shin-Urayasu and its distribution facility is located in Ichikawa City. STAAR performs final packaging of its silicone preloaded IOL injectors at the Ichikawa City facility.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas 

&#160;

100% of the Company&#8217;s sales are generated from the ophthalmic surgical product segment and, therefore, the Company operates as one operating segment for financial reporting purposes. The Company&#8217;s principal products are IOLs used in cataract surgery and ICLs used in refractive surgery. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about product lines and operations in geographic areas.

&#160;

Principal Products 

&#160;

In designing our products we seek to delight patients and surgeons by:

&#160;

&#183; Improving patient outcomes; &#160;

&#183; Minimizing patient risk; and &#160;

&#183; Simplifying ophthalmic procedures or post-operative care for the surgeon and the patient . &#160;

Visian ICL (ICLs). Refractive surgery corrects the types of visual disorders that glasses or contact lenses have traditionally treated (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism and presbyopia). The field of refractive surgery includes both lens-based procedures, using products like our ICL, and laser-based procedures like LASIK. The ICL product line treats a wide range of refractive errors within commonly known vision disorders such as myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism.

&#160;

The ICL folds for minimally invasive implantation behind the iris and in front of the natural crystalline lens, using techniques similar to those used to implant an IOL during cataract surgery, except that the natural lens remains intact in the eye. Lenses of this type are generically called &#8220;phakic IOLs&#8221; or &#8220;phakic implants&#8221; because they work along with the patient&#8217;s natural lens, or phakos , rather than replacing it. The surgeon typically implants the ICL using topical anesthesia on an outpatient basis. The patient usually recovers vision within one to 24 hours.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The ICL is the only posterior chamber phakic IOL (PIOL) approved and marketed for sale in the U.S., and we believe it is the world&#8217;s largest selling phakic IOL. We believe that our leadership in commercializing this technology results from a number of factors, including our intellectual property surrounding the design and production of our biocompatible Collamer material and the production of ICLs. Collamer belongs to a family of materials known as collagen copolymers. Collagen copolymers are compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. STAAR believes that the biocompatibility of the Collamer material used for the ICL (and Toric ICL &#8211; TICL, which also corrects for astigmatism) is a significant factor in the ability to place this lens safely in the posterior chamber of the eye. Compared to lenses placed in the anterior chamber, we believe that placement in the posterior chamber provides superior optical results, superior cosmetic appearance, and poses less risk of damage to the cornea.

&#160;

The ICL has been implanted into more than 550,000 eyes worldwide. STAAR began selling the ICL for myopia for use outside the U.S. in 1996. U.S. sales commenced in 2006. STAAR is the only company with FDA approval to sell a posterior chamber phakic IOL (such as our ICL) in the U.S. In September 2011, STAAR launched the ICL with CentraFLOW technology, which uses a port in the center of the ICL optic in ex-U.S. markets. The port is of a size intended to optimize the flow of fluid within the eye without affecting the quality of vision, and eliminates the need for the surgeon to perform a YAG peripheral iridotomy procedure days before the ICL implant. The CentraFLOW technology makes the visual outcomes of the ICL available through a simpler and more comfortable surgical implantation experience. We are able to sell the TICL and the ICL with CentraFLOW technology in the following ex-U.S. regions: the 33 countries that require the European Union CE Mark, China, Canada (at present, TICL only), Korea, Japan, India, Brazil, Singapore, and several countries in the Middle East. STAAR submitted its application for U.S. approval of the TICL to the FDA in 2006, and our application remains under review (see &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; Regulatory Requirements in the United States&#8221;). In December 2015, we received CE Mark for V5, an ICL with CentraFLOW technology and also an expanded optical zone up to 20%. We believe the expanded optical zone may further improve certain patients&#8217; visual experience, thus making the ICL increasingly desirable for both patients and surgeons. 

&#160;

The Hyperopic ICL, which treats far-sightedness, is sold primarily in countries that require the European Union CE Mark.

&#160;

Globally, the ICL is available for myopia and hyperopia and is available in multiple models, powers and lengths totaling hundreds of different types of inventoried lenses. This requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory to meet the customer preference for rapid delivery. Outside the U.S., the TICL is available for myopia and hyperopia in the same powers and lengths and also carries additional parameters of cylinder and axis. As a result, we customarily make the TICL to order. In 2015, we shipped approximately 78% of TICL orders in less than one week from receipt.

&#160;

Sales of ICLs (including TICLs) accounted for approximately 67% of our total sales in fiscal 2015, 59% of our total sales in fiscal 2014, and 61% of our total sales in fiscal 2013.

&#160;

Minimally Invasive Intraocular Lenses (IOLs). We produce and market a line of foldable IOLs for use in minimally invasive cataract surgical procedures. Because these lenses fold, surgeons can implant them into the eye through a micro- incision less than 3mm in length. Surgeons prefer foldable lenses and small incisions because clinical evidence has shown that larger incisions can induce corneal astigmatism, extend healing times, and increase the possibility of infection. Once inserted, the IOL unfolds naturally to replace the cataractous lens.

&#160;

In most of the countries where STAAR does business, government agencies reimburse the cost of cataract surgery and IOLs. Some countries permit ophthalmic surgeons and surgical centers to collect an additional fee from the cataract patient for products and services that go beyond standard treatment. STAAR offers IOLs that fall within the categories that offer an opportunity for STAAR and our customers to increase average selling prices. For example, the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) allows the provider to receive an additional payment from the patient for a premium lens, such as STAAR&#8217;s Toric IOL, and associated services.

&#160;

Currently, our foldable IOLs are manufactured from both our proprietary Collamer material and silicone. STAAR offers both materials in two differently configured styles: the single-piece design where both the optic and haptics are made of the same material and the three-piece design where Polyimide loop haptics are attached to the optic. We believe that the physical and optical properties of Collamer, which has a high water content, give it distinct advantages as a material for prosthetic IOLs used in cataract surgery. The selection of one style over the other is primarily based on the preference of the ophthalmologist. STAAR also sells aspheric IOLs made of silicone and Collamer that use optical designs that produce a clearer image than traditional spherical lenses, especially in low light. For example, the STAAR nanoFLEX IOL is a single piece Collamer aspheric optic that can be delivered through a micro-incision using STAAR&#8217;s nanoPOINT Injection System.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We have developed and currently market in the U.S. the Toric IOL, a toric version of our single-piece silicone IOL, which is specifically designed for cataract patients who also have pre-existing astigmatism.

&#160;

Also, in Japan and parts of Europe, we sell a &#8220;Preloaded Injector&#8221; with a silicone or acrylic IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector ready for use in cataract surgery. We believe the Preloaded Injector offers surgeons improved convenience and reliability. The acrylic lens-based Preloaded Injector uses a lens supplied by a third party. The supplier also assembles and sells the acrylic Preloaded Injector under its own brand, using injector parts purchased from us.

&#160;

Sales of IOLs accounted for approximately 26% of our total sales in fiscal 2015, 33% of our total sales in fiscal 2014, and 33% of our total sales in fiscal 2013.

&#160;

Other Surgical Products 

&#160;

We also sell other related instruments and devices that we manufacture or that are manufactured by others, but generally these products have lower overall gross profit margins relative to our ICLs and IOLs. Also, we sell injector parts to our lens supplier for their preloaded acrylic IOL that they sell under their own brand. Sales of other surgical products accounted for approximately 7% of our total sales in fiscal 2015, 9% of our total sales in fiscal 2014, and 5% of our total sales in fiscal 2013.

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160;

STAAR uses a wide range of raw materials in the production of its products. STAAR purchases most of the raw materials and components from external suppliers. Some of our raw materials are single-sourced due to regulatory constraints, cost effectiveness, availability, quality, and vendor reliability issues. Many of our components are standard parts or materials and are available from a variety of sources. We do not typically pursue regulatory and quality certification of multiple sources of supply.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160;

We strive to protect our investment in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our products through the use of patents, licenses, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. We own or have rights to a number of patents, licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property directly related and important to our business. As of January 1, 2016, we owned 27 United States and foreign patents and had 26 patent applications pending. In addition, as of January 1, 2016, our Japanese subsidiary owned 48 Japanese and foreign patents and had 2 patent applications pending. We believe that no particular patent is so important that its loss or expiration would materially adversely affect our operations as a whole. Our patents, including blocking patents, have expiration dates from 2016 through 2029.

&#160;

Our intellectual property generally relates to the design, production and manufacture of the Collamer lens material, ICLs, IOLs, and lens delivery systems for folding intraocular lenses (injectors and cartridges, both stand-alone and preloaded) used with ICLs and IOLs. We believe it would require extensive time and effort for a competitor to duplicate our intellectual property and processes to develop a product with comparable capabilities to our ICL or IOL product lines.

&#160;

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks we consider to be important to our business. STAAR&#174;, Visian&#174;, Collamer&#174;, CentraFLOW&#174;, AquaPORT&#174;, nanoFLEX&#174; nanoPOINT&#8482;, Epiphany&#174; and AquaFlow&#8482; are trademarks or registered trademarks of STAAR in the U.S. and other countries. Collamer&#174; is the brand name for STAAR&#8217;s proprietary collagen copolymer lens material. The scope and duration of trademark protection varies widely throughout the world. In some countries, trademark protection continues only as long as the mark is used. Other countries require registration of trademarks and the payment of registration fees. Trademark registrations are generally for fixed but renewable terms.

&#160;

We protect our proprietary technology, in part, through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. Our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to STAAR, without additional consideration, inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by STAAR, subject to customary exceptions. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or other terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Seasonality does not materially affect our sales in the first, second or fourth quarter. Sales in the third quarter may be lower due to the summer vacation effect in Europe.

&#160;

Working Capital Requirements 

&#160;

There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.

&#160;

Distribution and Customers 

&#160;

We market our products to a variety of health care providers, including surgical centers, hospitals, managed care providers, health organizations, group purchasing organizations and government facilities. The primary user of our products is the ophthalmologist.

&#160;

We sell our products directly through our own sales representatives in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, the U.K. and Spain and, supplemented by independent distributors, in approximately 60 additional countries worldwide. We maintain a global marketing team, as well as regional marketing personnel to support the promotion and sale of our products. The global marketing department supports selling efforts by developing and providing promotional materials, educational courses, speakers&#8217; programs, social media sites, participation in trade shows and technical presentations. Where we distribute products directly, we rely on local sales representatives to help generate sales by promoting and demonstrating our products with physicians. In the U.S., we also rely on independent sales representatives to sell our products under the supervision of directly employed sales managers. 

&#160;

Two customers, Shanghai Langsheng, our China distributor, and WooJeon Medical Co., Ltd., our Korean distributor, each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2015.

&#160;

Net sales to Shanghai Langsheng during each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:

Backlog 

&#160;

The dollar amount of STAAR&#8217;s backlogged orders is not material in relation to total annual sales. We generally keep sufficient inventory on hand to ship product immediately or shortly after receipt of an order.

Government Contracts 

&#160;

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of any particular contract or subcontract at the election of the U.S. Government.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Competition in the ophthalmic surgical product market is intense and is primarily driven by technological innovation and the regulatory approval required to commercialize products in the key markets around the world. The development of new or improved products may make existing products less attractive, reduce them to commodity status or even make them obsolete. To remain competitive, companies such as STAAR must devote continued efforts and significant financial resources to enhance their existing products and to develop new products.

&#160;

In the refractive market, our ICL technology competes with other elective surgical procedures such as laser vision correction, or LASIK, for those consumers who are looking for an alternative to eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct their vision. In the cataract surgery market, our IOLs primarily compete based on our technology&#8217;s quality and value.

&#160;

We believe our primary competition in selling the ICL to patients seeking surgery to correct refractive conditions lies not in similar products to the ICL, but in laser surgical procedures. Novartis (formerly Alcon), Abbott Medical Optics (formerly Advanced Medical Optics or AMO), and Valeant (formerly Bausch &#38; Lomb or B&#38;L) all market excimer lasers for corneal refractive surgery and promote their sales worldwide.

&#160;

Phakic implants that compete with the ICL are also available in the marketplace. The three principal types of phakic IOLs (PIOLs) are (1) posterior chamber designs like the ICL, (2) iris clip anterior chamber PIOLs like the Artisan&#174; and Artiflex&#174; lenses made by Ophtec (Artisan&#174; is distributed by AMO under the Verisyse&#174; brand), and (3) angle-supported anterior chamber PIOLs like the Cachet&#174; made by Novartis (formerly Alcon) which has been sold outside the U.S. We believe the ICL has compelling clinical advantages over the other lenses, which are reflected in our strong market share of the global phakic IOL market. The ICL is the only foldable, minimally invasive PIOL approved for sale in the U.S. Competitors from a low cost manufacturing geography are beginning to appear in the market with their version of an implantable contact lens, which we believe so far have not materially impacted our global sales.

&#160;

The global cataract market is highly concentrated, with the top three competitors (Alcon, Abbott Medical Optics, and Bausch &#38; Lomb) combined accounting for approximately 68% of total market revenue, according to a 2015 report by Market Scope, LLC, a publisher of ophthalmic industry analysis.

&#160;

The Human Eye 

&#160;

The following discussion provides background information on the structure, function and some of the disorders of the human eye to enhance the reader&#8217;s understanding of our products described in this report. The human eye is a specialized sensory organ capable of receiving visual images and transmitting them to the visual center in the brain. The eye has an anterior segment and a posterior segment that are separated by the natural crystalline lens.

&#160;

The anterior segment consists of the cornea, the iris and ciliary body and the trabecular meshwork. It is filled with a watery fluid called aqueous humor and is divided, by the iris, into an anterior chamber and a posterior chamber. The cornea is the clear window in the front of the eye through which light first passes. The interior surface of the cornea is lined with a single layer of flat, tile-like endothelial cells, whose function is to maintain the transparency of the cornea. The iris is a pigmented muscular curtain located behind the cornea which opens and closes to regulate the amount of light entering the eye through the pupil, an opening at the center of the iris. The natural lens is a clear structure located behind the iris that changes shape to focus light to the retina, located in the back of the eye. The medical term for the natural lens that is present in the eye from birth is &#8220;crystalline lens.&#8221; The trabecular meshwork, a drainage channel located between the iris and the surrounding white portion of the eye, maintains a normal pressure in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining excess aqueous humor.

&#160;

The posterior segment of the eye that is behind the natural lens is filled with a jelly-like material called the vitreous humor. The retina is a layer of nerve tissue in the back of the eye consisting of millions of light receptors called rods and cones, which receive the light image and transmit it to the brain via the optic nerve.

&#160;

The eye can be affected by common visual disorders, disease or trauma. One of the most prevalent ocular disorders is cataracts. Cataract formation is generally an age-related disorder that involves the hardening and loss of transparency of the natural crystalline lens, impairing visual acuity.

&#160;

Refractive disorders, which generally are not age-related, include myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. A normal, well-functioning eye receives images of objects at varying distances from the eye and focuses the images on the retina. Refractive errors occur when the eye&#8217;s natural optical system does not properly focus an image on the retina. Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, occurs when the eye&#8217;s lens focuses images in front of the retina. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, occurs when the eye&#8217;s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina. Individuals with myopia or hyperopia may also have astigmatism. Astigmatism is due to an irregular curvature of the cornea or defects in the natural lens. In an eye with astigmatism, light fails to come to a single focus on the retina. Instead, two or more focus points occur that results in blurred vision. Presbyopia is an age-related refractive disorder that limits a person&#8217;s ability to see in the near and middle distance range as the natural crystalline lens loses its elasticity, reducing the eye&#8217;s ability to accommodate or adjust its focus for varying distances.

&#160;

Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

Nearly all countries where we sell our products have regulations requiring premarket clearance or approval of medical devices by governmental or regulatory authorities. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws also apply to our operations, including, among other things, working conditions, laboratory, clinical, advertising and promotions, and design and manufacturing practices, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.

&#160;

The requirements for clearance or approval to market medical products vary widely by country. The requirements range from minimal requirements to rigorous requirements comparable to those established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Obtaining clearance or approval to distribute medical products is complex, costly and time-consuming in virtually all of the major markets where we sell medical devices. We cannot give any assurance that any new medical devices we develop will be cleared or approved in any country where we propose to sell our medical devices or, if approved, whether such approvals will be granted in a timely or cost-effective manner, be as broad in scope as we seek, or be conditioned on postmarket study requirements or restrictive labeling. We also cannot give any assurance that if our medical devices are approved for sale in a country, subsequent action will not be taken by the responsible regulatory authorities in the country with respect to our medical devices that might affect our ability to maintain the required approvals in the country or to continue to sell our medical devices in the country. The regulatory requirements in our most important current markets, the U.S., Europe Japan, China and Korea are discussed below.

&#160;

Regulatory Requirements in the United States. 

&#160;

Under the federal Food, Drug &#38; Cosmetic Act, as amended (the Act), the FDA has the authority to regulate, among other things, the design, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, product safety, marketing, sales, distribution, premarket clearance and approval, recordkeeping, reporting, advertising, promotion, post-market surveillance, and import and export of medical devices.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Most of our products are classified as medical devices intended for human use within the meaning of the Act and, therefore, are subject to FDA regulation.

&#160;

Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive clearance to market under a notification submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Act, known as the 510(k) premarket notification, or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency or subject to another form of FDA premarket review. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. The FDA establishes procedures for compliance based upon the device&#8217;s classification as Class I (general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing with FDA, labeling and record-keeping requirements), Class II (performance standards in addition to general controls) or Class III (premarket approval (PMA) required before commercial marketing). Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I (low risk) or II (moderate risk). Manufacturers of Class II devices are generally required to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Most low risk (Class I) devices and some Class II devices are exempt from this requirement. Class III devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk and are the most extensively regulated. These devices include life-supporting, life sustaining, or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device. The effect of assigning a device to Class III is to require each manufacturer to submit to the FDA a PMA that includes information on the safety and effectiveness of the device. The FDA reviews device applications and notifications through its Office of Device Evaluation (ODE).

&#160;

510(k) Clearance. Our lens injector systems are Class I devices subject to the 510(k) premarket review and clearance process. A medical device that is substantially equivalent to either a previously-cleared medical device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I may be eligible for the FDA&#8217;s 510(k) premarket notification process. FDA clearance under Section 510(k) of the Act does not imply that the safety, reliability and effectiveness of the medical device has been approved or validated by the FDA. The review period and FDA determination as to substantial equivalence generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed. However, the process may take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.

&#160;

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make its own initial determination as to whether a change meets this threshold. However, the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. We have modified aspects of some of our devices since receiving 510(k) clearance, and have determined that no new clearance or approval was required. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

&#160;

Premarket Approval . Our IOLs, ICLs, and AquaFlow Devices are Class III devices subject to the PMA approval process. When 510(k) clearance is not available, the more rigorous PMA process requires us to demonstrate independently that the new medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. A PMA must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical testing, manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.

&#160;

After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During the review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition to its own review, the FDA may organize an independent advisory panel of experts to review the PMA whenever a device is the first of its kind or the FDA otherwise determines panel review is warranted. The FDA holds panels on a regular basis, but the need to schedule panel review usually adds some weeks or months to the review process. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, validation, documentation, complaint handling, supplier control, and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and conduct of additional post-approval clinical studies or collection of long-term follow-up from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If a manufacturer plans to make significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, or design of an approved PMA device, the manufacturer must submit an application called a &#8220;PMA Supplement&#8221; regarding the change. The FDA generally reviews PMA Supplements on a 180-day agency timetable, which may be extended if significant questions arise in review of the supplement. A manufacturer may implement limited changes prior to the FDA&#8217;s review of a PMA Supplement. The FDA designates some PMA Supplements as &#8220;panel-track&#8221; supplements, which means that the agency believes review by an advisory panel may be warranted. Designation as a panel-track supplement does not necessarily mean that panel review will actually occur.

&#160;

Clinical or Market Trials. A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials conducted to support premarket clearance or approval generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA. All FDA-regulated clinical studies, whether significant or non-significant risk, must be approved and overseen by the appropriate institutional review boards (IRBs) at the clinical trial sites, and informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial must be obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it, if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct in the United States must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product.

&#160;

Oversight of compliance with quality, medical device reporting, clinical study and other regulations. Both before and after we receive premarket clearance or approval and release a product commercially, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, product complaints and manufacturers&#8217; required reports of adverse experiences, product corrections and removals, and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and other requirements, such as requirements for advertising and promotion. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations for medical devices embodied in the QSR govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use.

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO), reviews our activities as a sponsor of clinical research. BIMO conducts facilities inspections as part of a program designed to ensure that data and information contained in requests for IDEs, PMA applications and 510(k) submissions are scientifically valid, reliable, and accurate. Another objective of the program is to ensure that human subjects are protected from undue hazard or risk during the course of scientific investigations.

&#160; 

If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risk or substantial harm to public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban the medical devices. The FDA may also issue warning letters or untitled letters, refuse our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, revoke existing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals previously granted, impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. In the case of devices subject to pending premarket clearance or approval applications, FDA has broad authority to halt the review of applications and require significant additional data analyses, audits, and other corrective actions where clinical data contained in an application are deemed to be actually or potentially unreliable, inaccurate, or not in compliance with clinical study or good clinical practice requirements. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

For example, in 2007 we received a warning letter following a BIMO inspection that identified negative inspectional observations. Prior to the inspection and the warning letter, we submitted a PMA supplement for the TICL to the FDA on April 28, 2006, which the agency designated as a panel-track supplement. In August 2007, following negative inspectional observations and the warning letter the FDA Office of Device Evaluation placed an integrity hold on our TICL application. Over a two-year period we took a number of corrective actions to address BIMO&#8217;s concerns and to remove the integrity hold, including engaging an independent third party to conduct a 100% audit of patient records in the TICL clinical study, along with an audit of clinical systems to ensure accuracy and completeness of data before resubmitting the application. On July 21, 2009, the FDA notified us that as a result of our corrective actions the FDA had removed the integrity hold on the application for approval of the TICL, and would resume its consideration of the application. In February 2010 and November 2011, we received letters of deficiency from the FDA outlining additional questions. After several communications with and additional data submissions to the FDA, on March 14, 2014 an FDA Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, which assessed our PMA Supplement submission seeking approval of the TICL, voted favorably in response to the three questions posed to it by the FDA&#8217;s Division of Ophthalmic, Neurological and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices regarding the TICL&#8217;s safety and effectiveness as well as whether the TICL&#8217;s benefits outweigh its risks.

&#160;

On May 27, 2014, we received a warning letter from the FDA (2014 Warning Letter) citing alleged violations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations that were identified by the FDA during an inspection of our manufacturing facility in Monrovia, California between February 10, 2014 and March 21, 2014. To summarize, the 2014 Warning Letter observations require remedial action in four general areas: design control documentation; validation of software for an on-line calculator; data collection and trending of ICL vault complaints; and shelf life data on the ICL product. The 2014 Warning Letter provides that, until the Company addresses the deficiencies to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will not approve PMAs for the Company&#8217;s Class III devices where the applications are reasonably related to the cGMP violations cited in the 2014 Warning Letter.

&#160;

Beginning on November 14, 2014 and continuing through February 4, 2015, the FDA inspected our Monrovia facility. On February 4, 2015, at the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA issued the 2015 FDA-483 with ten inspectional observations (2015 FDA-483). The observations focus primarily on the need for adherence to and improved procedures, processes and documentation relating to design change, design transfer into specifications and production, verification and validation associated with device design and production, improvement in good documentation practices, and broader environmental monitoring. STAAR responded to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483 and is concurrently continuing to implement its corrective action plans relating to the 2014 Warning Letter and the 2015 FDA-483. STAAR has continued to submit monthly updates to FDA regarding its progress on corrective actions. While the PMA supplement remains pending, we cannot predict when, or if, the FDA will grant approval of the TICL for use in the United States.

&#160;

Our ability to continue our U.S. business depends on the continuous improvement of our quality systems and our ability to demonstrate compliance with FDA regulations. Accordingly, our management expects to continue to devote significant resources and attention to those efforts for the foreseeable future.

&#160; 

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations. 

&#160;

Even though we do not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients&#8217; rights are applicable to our business. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:

&#160;

&#183; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; &#160;

&#183; the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers; &#160;

&#183; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; &#160;

&#183; t he federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value relating to certain drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; t he federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and &#160;

&#183; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, which may differ from each other and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. &#160;

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recently enacted Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

&#160;

Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our reputation and our financial results.

&#160;

Regulatory Requirements outside the United States. 

&#160;

CE Marking . In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medical devices must comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive is a prerequisite to be able to affix a Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne Mark (CE Mark), without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification.

&#160;

The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a &#8220;Notified Body.&#8221; Notified Bodies are a group of private quality-monitoring organizations that are accredited to review medical devices and to monitor quality systems and adverse event reporting. The independent Notified Bodies perform, on a privatized basis, functions similar to the FDA in the U.S. and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA) in Japan. Our facilities in the United States, Japan and Switzerland are all subject to regular inspection by a designated Notified Body. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices, and a number of countries outside of Europe permit importation of devices bearing the CE Mark. 

&#160;

We have affixed the CE Mark to all of our principal products including ICL and TICL products, IOLs, injector systems and our AquaFlow Device.

&#160; 

Medical Device Regulation in Japan. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) regulates the sale of medical devices under Japan&#8217;s Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL). The PMDA, a quasi-governmental organization, performs many of the medical device review functions for MHLW. Medical devices generally must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before the MHLW grants shonin (premarket device approval) or ninsho (certification). Manufacturers and resellers (referred to as Marketing Authorization Holders or MAHs) must also satisfy certain requirements before the MHLW grants a business license, or kyoka . Requirements for manufacturers and MAHs include compliance with Japanese regulations covering GQP (good quality control practice) and GVP (good vigilance practice), which largely include conformity to the ISO 13485 standard and are similar to good manufacturing practice and post-market surveillance requirements in the United States, as well as the assignment of internal supervisors over marketing, quality assurance and safety control.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Approval for a new medical device that lacks a substantial equivalent in the Japanese market will generally require the submission of clinical trial data. Only a licensed MAH can apply for premarket device approval in Japan, and in most cases, the clinical trial data must include data gathered from Japanese subjects. For example, STAAR Japan conducted a separate clinical trial in Japan for the shonin application for the ICL. Also, approval for a new medical device will require the manufacturer to undertake to reexamine the safety and efficacy of the device with a review of postmarket data gathered within a certain period - normally four years - after approval. The specific postmarket reexamination requirement for a medical device is announced at the time of approval.

&#160;

STAAR Japan currently holds shonin approval for the ICL and TICL, preloaded injectors and their associated lenses, and kyoka licensing as a manufacturer and MAH of medical devices. The sponsor of a clinical trial submitted to the MHLW must strictly follow Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, and must follow the trial with standard Good Postmarket Study Practice (GPSP) reporting and a follow-up program. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of manufacturers and the conformity of products to the requirements of PAL. STAAR is subject to inspection for compliance by these agencies. A company&#8217;s failure to comply with PAL can result in severe penalties, including revocation or suspension of a company&#8217;s business license and possible criminal sanctions. If the PMDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company.

&#160;

Medical Device Regulation in China and Korea. Sales of our products in China and Korea, as in other countries, are also subject to regulatory requirements. In China, medical devices such as our ICLs and IOLs require testing by a government recognized laboratory qualified as a medical device testing center in accordance with Chinese standards. Results from the testing center, together with registration documents, are submitted to the Center for Medical Device Evaluation (CMDE) of the Chinese FDA (CFDA) for technical evaluation and if accepted, then approval and registration by CFDA. In China, we obtain registration of our products from CFDA ourselves. In Korea, medical devices such as our ICLs and IOLs require registration and approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) prior to commercialization. Typically, the MFDS requires similar documentation as required to obtain a CE Mark. Our distributor in Korea is contractually required to obtain, with our assistance, the necessary health registrations, governmental approvals or clearances to import, market and sell our products. We provide our distributor with information and data to obtain appropriate registrations and approvals, and the distributor obtains such registrations. If the CFDA or MFDS were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could take a variety of regulatory or legal actions in their respective countries, similar to the FDA, which could have a material and negative impact on the Company.

&#160;

Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement. 

&#160;

Health care providers generally rely on third-party payers, including governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers&#8217; compensation plans, to cover and reimburse the cost of medical devices and related services. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a medical device if they determine that the product or procedure using the product was not medically appropriate or necessary and are increasingly challenging the price of medical devices and services.

&#160;

Our ICL products generally are not covered by third-party payers, and patients incur out-of-pocket costs for these products and related procedures using our products. Our IOL products used in cataract procedures generally are covered by third-party payers, including Medicare, in whole or in part depending upon a variety of factors, including the specific product used and geographic location where the procedure using the covered product is performed. The market for some of our IOL products therefore is influenced by third-party payers&#8217; policies.

&#160;

In the United States, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, or CMS, sets coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. CMS may modify its coverage and reimbursement policies related to IOLs, including our IOLs, as well as cataract procedures using IOLs, at any time. Since the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, there have been an increasing number of legislative initiatives in the United States to contain health care coverage and reimbursement by governmental and other payers. These new laws, as well as future laws that may be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and thus, our financial operations.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted cost containment initiatives similar to those in the United States. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that such policies or any future legislation or regulation will not adversely affect the demand for our IOLs or our ability to sell these products at prices we consider adequate.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We focus on furthering technological advancements in the ophthalmic products industry through the development of innovative premium ophthalmic products (lenses and companion delivery systems), materials and designs. We maintain active internal research and development programs. In order to achieve our business objectives, we will continue our investment in research and development.

&#160;

During 2016, we intend to continue our focus on research and development in the following areas:

&#160;

&#183; Development of presbyopia-correcting ICLs; &#160;

&#183; Development of preloaded injector systems for ICLs; and &#160;

&#183; Beginning work on a new generation of ICLs and materials. &#160;

Our research and development expenses were approximately $14.8 million, $ 12.4 million, and $6.7 million for our 2015, 2014, and 2013 fiscal years, respectively. We expect to invest slightly in excess of 20% of sales in research and development in 2016. During 2015, our research and development expenses increased $2.4 million as compared to 2014, including increases of $1.4 million in validation related expenses, $600,000 in FDA remediation activities and $700,000 in clinical activities, partially offset by a decrease in project spending. The Company expects to continue its FDA remediation activities through 2016 and expects to spend approximately $2.1 million for these activities in 2016 as compared to approximately $4.0 million in 2015. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we do business. We do not expect compliance with these laws to affect materially our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We have no plans to invest in material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for the remainder of our current fiscal year or for the next fiscal year. We are not aware of any pending actions, litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position. However, environmental problems relating to our properties could develop in the future, and such problems could require significant expenditures. In addition, we cannot predict changes in environmental legislation or regulations that may be adopted or enacted in the future and that may adversely affect us.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of February 15, 2016, we had approximately 360 employees .

&#160;

Glossary 

&#160; 

The following glossary is intended to help the reader understand some of the terms used in this Report.

&#160;

acrylic &#8211; a broadly used family of plastics. Acrylic materials used in IOLs have been both water repelling ( hydrophobic ) and water-absorbing ( hydrophilic ). The most popular IOLs in the U.S., Europe and Japan are made of a flexible, water-repellent acrylic material.

&#160; 

aspheric &#8211; aspheric lenses are lenses that are designed in a shape that creates a more clearly focused image than traditional spheric lenses. By reducing spherical aberrations, IOLs that feature aspheric optics generally deliver better night vision and contrast sensitivity than spheric IOLs.

&#160;

collagen copolymer - compounds formed by joining molecules of collagen derived from biological sources with synthetic monomer molecules. STAAR&#8217;s Collamer&#174; is a collagen copolymer engineered specifically for use in implantable lenses.

&#160;

contrast sensitivity - the ability to visually distinguish an object from its background.

&#160;

crystalline lens &#8211; the natural lens that is present in the eye at birth, which is a clear structure, located behind the iris that changes shape to focus light onto the retina.

&#160;

excimer laser &#8211; a specialized ultraviolet laser used in ophthalmology to cut or shape eye tissue. The excimer laser is used during LASIK and PRK surgery.

&#160;

foldable IOL &#8211; an intraocular lens made of flexible material, which can be inserted with an injector system through a small incision in minimally invasive cataract surgery.

&#160;

haptic &#8211; the part of an IOL that contacts the structures of the eye and holds the IOL in place. IOLs in which the haptic is also a part of the optic material is called a single-piece IOL, while IOLs in which the haptics are attached to the optic is called a three-piece IOL.

&#160;

hyperopia &#8211; the refractive disorder commonly known as farsightedness, which occurs when the eye&#8217;s lens focuses images behind the plane of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. A person with hyperopia cannot see close objects without glasses or contact lenses. Because presbyopia often results in the need for reading glasses, it is sometimes confused with farsightedness.

&#160;

intraocular &#8211; within the eye. 

&#160;

injector or injector system &#8211; a device in the form of a syringe that is used to deliver a foldable IOL into the eye through a slender nozzle in minimally invasive cataract surgery.

&#160;

iridotomy &#8211; a small hole created in the iris, usually made with a YAG laser. Prior to implantation of some ICL models a YAG peripheral iridotomy is made in an unobtrusive area at the periphery of the iris to ensure continued fluid flow in the eye after implantation. The ICL with CentraFLOW technology has a central port for fluid flow, which eliminates the need for an iridotomy or iridectomy.

&#160;

LASIK &#8211; an acronym for laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, a surgical operation that reshapes the cornea to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. LASIK involves first the cutting of a hinged flap to separate the surface layer of the cornea, using a microkeratome (a special blade) or a laser. An excimer laser is then used to burn tissue away and reshape the inner cornea, after which the flap is returned to position.

&#160;

myopia &#8211; the refractive disorder also known as nearsightedness, which occurs when the eye&#8217;s lens focuses images in front of the retina rather than on the retinal surface. A person with myopia cannot clearly see distant objects without glasses or contact lenses.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

ophthalmologist &#8211; a surgeon who specializes in the diseases and disorders of the eye and the related visual pathway.

&#160;

ophthalmic &#160; &#8211; of or related to the eye.

&#160;

optic &#8211; the central part of an IOL or ICL, the part that functions as a lens and focuses images on the retina.

&#160;

PRK &#8211; an acronym for photorefractive keratectomy, the first type of laser surgical operation to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.

&#160;

Preloaded Injector - a silicone or acrylic IOL packaged and shipped in a pre-sterilized, disposable injector. This differs from the conventional method of packaging IOLs, which requires the surgeon or an assistant to manually load each lens into an injector before surgery.

&#160;

presbyopia &#8211; an age-related condition in which the crystalline lens loses its ability to focus on both near and far objects. People who have had normal vision will typically begin to need glasses for reading or other close tasks at some point after age 40 due to presbyopia.

&#160;

QSR - The FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulation, includes requirements related to the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and servicing of medical devices intended for human use. The regulation sets forth the framework for medical device manufacturers to follow in achieving quality requirements, including requirements related to complaint handling and control of purchased or supplied services, components, and materials bearing on the quality of medical devices . 

&#160;

refractive market &#8211; as used in this report &#8220;refractive market&#8221; means the overall market volume for refractive surgical procedures of all kinds, including LASIK, PRK, the Visian ICL product family and other phakic IOLs. As used in this report, the term does not include sales of non-surgical products like eyeglasses and contact lenses.

&#160;

silicone &#8211; a type of plastic often used in implantable devices that is inert, generally flexible and water-repelling.

&#160;

single-piece IOL &#8211; in a single piece IOL the haptics and the optic are fashioned from a single piece of lens material.

&#160; 

spheric lenses &#8211; a spheric lens has surfaces that are shaped like sections of a sphere. The sphere is not an ideal shape for an optically accurate lens, but spherical surfaces have historically been the simplest lens shape to make. Spheric lenses have spherical aberrations &#8211; small errors in focus that become more pronounced at the edge of the lens When a spheric IOL is placed in the human eye, these aberrations can reduce night vision and contrast sensitivity.

&#160;

three-piece IOL &#8211; a three-piece IOL has a central, disk-shaped optic and two spring-like haptics attached at either side. The haptics are positioned against structures of the eye to hold the IOL in place.

&#160;

toric &#8211; refers to the shape of a lens designed to correct astigmatism, which has greater refractive power in some sections of the lens than others.

&#160; 

YAG &#8211; an acronym for yttrium-aluminum-garnet, a mineral crystal. Lasers using neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet crystals (Nd:YAG) generate a high-energy beam that can be used in a number of ophthalmic procedures, including creating iridotomies before implantation of some models of the ICL.

&#160;
