Increase primarily was due to the impact of the Company’s strategic portfolio realignment achieved through the recycling of capital from asset sales into the acquisition of high-quality power centers, as well as continued leasing of the existing portfolio at positive rental spreads. 

Strategy and Philosophy

The Company’s mission is to create shareholder value by inspiring an extraordinary team to thoughtfully allocate time and capital to the highest quality portfolio of power centers. The Company strives to own premier locations for our retail partners to win market share and provide value and convenience for their customers. The organization is focused on optimizing portfolio performance within a constantly evolving retail landscape. 

The strategy, philosophy, investment and financing policies of the Company, and its policies with respect to certain other activities including its growth, debt capitalization, dividends, status as a REIT and operating policies, are determined by management and the Board of Directors. Although the Board of Directors has no present intention to amend or revise its policies, the Board of Directors may do so from time to time without a vote of the Company’s shareholders. 

The Company’s key strategies are sum marized as follows: 

- 

Focus on long-term net asset value creation within the portfolio through strategic leasing, re-tenanting and redevelopment of the Company’s portfolio to be the preeminent landlord to the retailers that are winning market share and that are most successfully adapting in an omni-channel retailing environment; 

- 

Invest in assets that are expected to appreciate over the long term and where retailers will desire to locate for the best marketing and distribution of their goods and services; 

- 

Focus on the transactional analysis of which assets are more valuable in the Company’s operating platform and which are more valuable to someone else; 

- 

Develop and execute an action plan for those assets or tenants that could have a negative impact on cash flow and perceived portfolio quality over the long term; 

- 

Continue to focus on balance sheet improvement achieved through lowering leverage and maintaining long-term debt duration that allows for access to capital in all market cycles and 

- 

Continue to build and develop a team of empowered employees to execute with excellence.

The Company’s five largest tenants based on the Company’s aggregate annualized base rental revenues, including its proportionate share of joint venture aggregate annualized base rental revenues, are TJX Companies, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Walmart, PetSmart and Kohl's, representing 3.5%, 3.2%, 3.0%, 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively, of the Company’s aggregate annualized base rental revenues at December 31, 2015.
