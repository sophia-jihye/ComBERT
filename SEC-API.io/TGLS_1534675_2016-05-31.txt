 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We were originally formed under the name &#8220;Andina Acquisition Corporation&#8221; for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On March 22, 2012, we consummated our initial public offering (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;), and on December 20, 2013, we consummated our initial business combination (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), whereby our wholly-owned subsidiary merged with and into Tecnoglass Holding. As a result of the Merger, Tecnoglass Holding and its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tecnoglass and ES, became our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, the business of Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries became our business. We are now a holding company operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

&#160;

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with Tecnoglass Holding being considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger. For accounting and financial purposes, we were treated as the acquired company, and Tecnoglass Holding was treated as the acquiring company. Accordingly, historical information, including historical financial information and the historical description of our business, for periods and dates prior to December 20, 2013, include information for Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

General 

&#160; 

We are a leading manufacturer of hi-spec architectural glass and windows for the western hemisphere residential and commercial construction industries, operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Headquartered in Barranquilla, Colombia, we operate out of a 2.8 million square foot vertically-integrated, state-of-the-art manufacturing complex that provides easy access to the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacific.

&#160;

We sell our products to more than 900 customers in North, Central and South America. The United States accounted for approximately 59% and 51% of our combined revenues in 2015 and 2014, while Colombia accounted for approximately 34% and 41%, and Panama for approximately 3% and 6% of our combined revenues in those years. Our tailored, high-end products are found on some of the world&#8217;s most distinctive properties, including the El Dorado Airport (Bogota), 50 UN Plaza (New York), Fordham University Law School (New York), Trump Tower (Panama), Brickell City Centre (Miami), and The Woodlands (Houston).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Tecnoglass. Tecnoglass is a leading manufacturer of a variety of glass products installed primarily in commercial and residential buildings, including tempered safety, double thermo-acoustic and laminated glass. Tecnoglass products are installed in hotels, residential buildings, commercial and corporate centers, universities, airports and hospitals in a variety of applications such as floating facades, curtain walls, windows, doors, handrails, interior and bathroom spatial dividers. Approximately 57% of Tecnoglass products are supplied to ES for installation in various products that ES manufactures, with the balance of Tecnoglass products being sold to customers throughout North, Central and South America. In 2015 Tecnoglass established its Solartec plant, to produce low emissivity glass with high thermal insulation specifications using soft coat technology.

&#160;

Tecnoglass also produces aluminum products such as profiles, rods, bars, plates and other hardware used in the manufacture of windows. In 2007, Tecnoglass established its Alutions plant in Barranquilla, Colombia for extrusion, smelting, painting and anodizing processes, and for exporting, importing and marketing aluminum products. The Alutions plant contributes more than 90% of the raw materials needed for production of Tecnoglass aluminum products.

&#160;

Glass Magazine ranked Tecnoglass as the second largest glass fabricator serving the U.S. market in 2013. We believe that it is the leading glass transformation company in Colombia, capturing 40% of the market share in the country. 

&#160;

ES. ES is a leader in the production of high-end windows, with more than 29 years of experience in the glass and aluminum structure assembly market in Colombia. ES designs, manufactures, markets and installs architectural systems for high, medium and low rise construction, glass and aluminum windows and doors, office dividers and interiors, floating facades and commercial display windows.

&#160;

ES has expanded its U.S. sales outside of the Florida market for windows, into the high-tech market for curtain walls, a product that is in high demand and represents a new trend in architecture, and floating facades. Due to the sophistication of these new products, ES believes that sales of curtain walls will generate higher margins as compared to traditional window frames from walls or floor to ceiling windows. Curtain walls produced by ES are composed of &#8220;high performance&#8221; materials that are produced by Alutions, the aluminum smelting plant, and Tecnoglass with state of the art technology.

&#160;

Since 2004, we have a strategic commercial relationship with ES Windows LLC (&#8220;ESW LLC&#8221;), a Florida-based company partially owned by Christian T. Daes and Jos&#233; M. Daes, who are also our executive officers and directors. ESW LLC is a member of the American Architectural Manufacturers Association, a technical information center for the architecture industry with highest standards. ESW LLC sends project specifications and orders from its clients to ES, and in turn, receives pricing quotes from ES which are conveyed to the client.

&#160;

In 2014, we established two entities in South Florida, Tecno LLC and Tecno RE, to acquire manufacturing and warehousing facilities, customer lists and exclusive design permits in order to support sales growth in the United States. We will continue to manufacture our products at our facilities in Barranquilla, Colombia while performing select manufacturing and light assembly in the U.S. to enhance client service and create certain cost efficiencies.

&#160;

In Panama, ES sells products primarily to companies participating in large construction projects in the most exclusive areas of Panama City. For example, ES products were supplied in the construction of the tallest building in Central and South America, The Point, as well as in the construction of other modern hotels in the region such as Megapolis and The Trump. Based on ES&#8217;s knowledge of the construction market in Central America, we believe that it has also entered into one of the highest value window supply contracts in the hotel industry in Central America for the Soho Plaza.

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

Vertical Integration 

&#160;

We believe we are unique in vertically integrating the purchase of raw materials, the manufacture of glass and aluminum products and the subsequent production of customized glass and windows for architectural and industrial settings. By vertically integrating these functions, we are able to price our products competitively while maintaining strict quality control measures to guarantee the high quality of our products. Additionally, we benefit from significant advantages in efficiency and time-to-market for new or customized products. This vertically integrated model provides attractive margins with significant operating leverage.

&#160;

&#160;

Innovation 

&#160;

We have made significant investments in machinery and equipment in order to utilize the latest technology on our production lines, including a recently completed approximately $80.2 million capital investment in land, warehouses and state-of-the-art glass making equipment thereby expanding our manufacturing capacity. In August 2014, we entered into a contract to purchase equipment from Magnetron Sputter Vacuum Deposition to produce soft coated low emissivity glass as part of our improvements plan, which started production in the last quarter of 2015. The investment for this project is estimated at $45 million for the equipment and facilities.

&#160;

Additionally, we purchased two glass laminating and tempering furnaces that use new technologies to produce tempered glass with no distortion using air cushion technology and to produce curved glass in a broad range of easily modifiable curvatures.

&#160;

For certain of our products, we offer DuPont Sentryglass&#174; laminated glass interlayers which are recognized as industry-leading laminated glass solutions with five times the resistance strength of other materials available on the market. We also use a laminator and jumbo tempering oven capable of producing extra-large slabs of laminated glass which are sought after in the high-end window market. These investments in machinery and equipment, together with our highly trained labor force, allow us to offer state-of-the-art custom designed products quickly modified to meet customer demands. We also have a staff of specialists dedicated to product design in order to meet customer specifications.

&#160;

Superior Customer Service 

&#160;

In addition to manufacturing high quality products, our value proposition to our customers is based on industry-leading lead times, on-time delivery and superior after-sale support. Through the coordinated efforts of our sales teams, product specialists, and field service teams, we deliver high quality service to our customers, from the time the initial order is placed through the delivery and installation of our products. By providing an efficient flow of product from order through delivery, our manufacturing processes allow us to deliver made-to-order products consistently on time, which we believe is an important competitive strength.

&#160;

Management Experience 

&#160;

Jos&#233; Daes, our chief executive officer, and Christian Daes, our chief operating officer, have more than 30 and 20 years of industry experience, respectively. In addition, our executive management teams have worked together for many years at our operating subsidiaries. This long tenure in the industry, and as a team, has enabled our management to build significant relationships with both clients and field level management. We believe that these relationships, coupled with management&#8217;s strong technical expertise, create a significant competitive advantage.

&#160;

Location 

&#160;

Our headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located in Barranquilla, Colombia, which is strategically located near three major ports in Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta. These ports, which are only two hours&#8217; drive from each other, provide us with sea access to all major markets globally.

&#160;

High Barriers to Entry 

&#160;

Entry into many of the markets that we serve is limited due to the technical certifications required on high specification building projects. Our success is due in large part to the breadth of our product offering and our reputation for delivering high quality, made-to-order architectural glass on time. These factors are required to compete successfully for multimillion dollar projects typical of our business. Given the vertically-integrated nature of our operations, including the aluminum extrusion products provided by Tecnoglass, there is a more limited set of competitors and entry into these markets. In addition, the equipment needed to operate in the glass and window industry is expensive, requiring a significant upfront capital investment.

&#160;

Competitive pricing 

&#160;

We offer our customers highly competitive prices due to efficiencies realized from vertical integration and low labor costs. These competitive advantages allow us great flexibility in pricing their components to be competitive in a variety of markets.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

We have identified the following items that we believe are important in advancing our business:

&#160;

Continued investments in machinery and equipment with state-of-the-art technology 

&#160;

We have made investments of approximately $142.6 million since 2014, including $80.2 million in 2015 in state-of-the-art glass making equipment, the installation of new laminating lines, high-volume insulating equipment, a new aluminum extrusion press with the capacity for an additional one thousand tons per month, a new paint line with the capacity to treat one million pounds of aluminum per month, and a new aluminum foundry.

&#160;

&#160;

Development of additional high value products 

&#160;

We have a demonstrated track record of developing new products and will continue to focus on capitalizing on new product opportunities in the future. We constantly identify shifting global trends and growing marketplace needs, and design proposals to meet those needs. A feasibility and tuning program, including testing at specialized laboratories in the U.S., is carried out before marketing a new product. In 2014 we started producing architectural systems that integrate LED lighting allowing the fa&#231;ade of the building to display different colors and patterns.

&#160;

Additionally, we are in the process of implementing new technologies to produce tempered glass that offers notably more transparency with significantly less distortion than industry standard using air cushion technology, as well as new technology used to produce curved glass in a broad range of easily modifiable curvatures.

&#160;

Manufacture the highest quality products in the market through a rigorous quality assurance program 

&#160;

Our plants are organized internally by processes, each of which is independently and continually supervised by the Quality Assurance department. The Quality Assurance department maintains rigorous oversight over energy, water, recyclable waste and process optimization indicators, in order to produce high quality sustainable products. Approximately 30% of all our waste is recycled.

&#160;

Continued vertical integration provides margin enhancement 

&#160;

We benefit from operating together under a combined facility, providing advantages in meeting customer and market needs and managing costs. By continuing to expand our degree of vertical integration, we can further enhance productivity, create cost efficiencies and increase operating margins.

&#160;

Leverage strength in Colombia market to further penetrate Latin America 

&#160;

With a strong base in Colombia, we have already successfully expanded into nearby geographies. Our glass products are featured in major construction projects in Argentina, Aruba, Costa Rica, Panama and Puerto Rico. As the construction market throughout Latin America grows, we are positioned to capture new growth in the markets we have currently penetrated, as well as in new high growth countries.

&#160;

Leverage strength in Florida market to further penetrate U.S. 

&#160;

We believe we have an established and leading presence in the Florida construction market as providers of high value, impact-resistant glass products. ES&#8217;s hurricane-proof products are certified in compliance with the stringent requirements of hurricane-proof windows in accordance with applicable U.S. regulations. With a quality of product proven by our success and compliance in the impact-resistant market, we have successfully entered the U.S. remodeling and replacement parts market. In addition, we have the opportunity to grow geographically in the U.S., particularly into other coastal markets on the East Coast which are affected by hurricanes, significant temperature fluctuations and other extreme weather.

&#160;

Maintain fast and reliable delivery to customers due to strategic location 

&#160;

From the Port of Barranquilla, products can be transported to Panama by air in one hour and to Houston and Miami within two hours, within two days by sea to Panama and within four days by sea to Houston and Miami.

&#160;

Penetrate additional markets 

&#160;

With a strong base in Colombia and Florida, we will seek to expand into further geographies, such as Asia and Europe. We believe the centralized location of the Port of Barranquilla will aid in our expanding into such new markets.

&#160;

Brands and Trademarks 

&#160;

Our brands include Tecnoglass, ES Windows and Alutions. Our registered trademarks include &#8220;Alutions by Tecnoglass&#8221; with the accompanying logo and &#8220;Alutions&#8221;. Tecnoglass and ES Windows are not registered as trademarks by us.

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Customer Service 

&#160;

Sales and marketing 

&#160;

Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining customers by consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product quality, and competitive pricing. Our customers also value their shorter lead times, knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise, which collectively generate significant customer loyalty. Our products are marketed using a combination of their internal sales representatives and independent sales representatives and directly to distributors. Our internal sales representatives receive performance-based compensation based on sales and profitability metrics. We primarily market our products based on product quality, outstanding service, shorter lead times and on-time delivery.

&#160;

Customer Service 

&#160;

We believe that our ability to provide customers outstanding service quality serves as a strong competitive differentiator. Our customer relationships are established and maintained through the coordinated efforts of our sales and production teams. We employ a team of highly seasoned professionals devoted to addressing customer support with the goal of resolving any issue in a timely manner. In order to promote customer loyalty and employee development, we developed ES Windows University with the primary objectives of training employees to be aware of client and supplier needs and familiarizing them with our strategic goals in order to improve the competitiveness, productivity and quality of all products offered.

&#160;

Working Capital Requirements 

&#160;

Trade accounts receivable is the largest component of working capital, including receivables relating to contractual retention amounts that can be outstanding throughout the project duration for large-scale architectural projects. Our inventory requirements are not significant since our products are made-to-order rather than build-to-stock. As a result, inventory levels follow customer demand for products produced.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers include architects, building owners, general contractors and glazing subcontractors in the commercial construction market. We have over 900 customers. Of our 100 most representative customers, which represent over 92% of our sales, about 33% are located in North America, 10% in Central America and the Caribbean, and 57% in South America. Excluding revenue from related parties, only one customer accounted for more than 10% or more of our net sales during 2015or 2014 with 14% of sales during both 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

We had combined outstanding orders of $375 million as of December 31, 2015 as compared to $280 million as of December 31, 2014. We do not believe that backlog is indicative of our future results of operations or prospects. Although we seek commitments from customers well in advance of shipment dates, actual confirmed orders are typically not received until close to the required shipment dates.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Materials and Suppliers 

&#160;

Our primary manufacturing materials include glass, ionoplast, polyvinyl butyral, and aluminum and vinyl extrusions. Although in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by us or the supplier counterparties on limited notice. Typically, all of our materials are readily available from a number of sources, and no supplier delays or shortages are anticipated.

&#160;

We source raw materials and glass necessary to manufacture our products from a variety of domestic and foreign suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of total raw material purchases.

&#160; 

Warranties 

&#160;

We offer product warranties which we believe are competitive for the markets in which our products are sold. The nature and extent of these warranties depend upon the product. Our standard warranties are generally from five to ten years for architectural glass, curtain wall, laminated and tempered glass, window and door products. Warranties are not priced or sold separately and do not provide the customer with services or coverages in addition to the assurance that the product complies with original agreed-upon specifications. In the event of a claim against a product for which we have received a warranty from the supplier, we transfer the claim back to the supplier. The Company evaluated historical information regarding claims for replacements under warranties and concluded that the costs that the Company have incurred in relation to these warranties have not been material.

&#160;

Certifications 

&#160;

Among our many designations and certifications, Tecnoglass has earned the Miami-Dade County Notice of Acceptance (&#8220;NOA&#8221;), one of the most demanding certificates in the industry and a requirement to market hurricane-resistant glass in Florida. Tecnoglass&#8217; products comply with Miami-Dade county&#8217;s safety code standards as its laminated anti-hurricane glass resists impact, pressure, water and wind. Tecnoglass is also the only company in Latin America authorized by PPG Industries and Guardian Industries to manufacture floating glass facades.

&#160;

Our subsidiaries have received a number of other certifications from other national and international standard-setting bodies.

&#160;

Competitors 

&#160;

We have local competitors in Colombia as well as competitors in the markets internationally, in each of the glass, aluminum and finished products sectors. Glass Tecnologia en Vidrios y Ventanas S.A., Arquicentro S.A. , Aluminum Estructural S.A. and Ventanar Ltda, compete with us in the finished products market in Colombia. Apogee Enterprises, Inc., PGT, Inc. and WinDoor Inc. compete with us in the U.S. finished products market. Golden Glass Security, Vid-plex Universal S.A., Aluace Ltda and Laminados y Blindados compete with us locally in the glass and aluminum markets. Oldcastle, Inc., Trulite Inc., and PRL Glass Systems are among others that compete with us in the U.S. glass and aluminum products markets. 

&#160;

The key factors on which we and our competitors compete for business include: quality, price and reputation, breadth of products and service offerings, and production speed. We face intense competition from both smaller and larger market players who compete against us in our various markets including glass, window and aluminum manufacturing.

&#160;

The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door distributors and dealers, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality customized products on demand with short turnaround times while offering competitive pricing. The vertical integration of our operations, our geographic scope, low labor costs and economies of scale have helped our subsidiaries consolidate their leading position in Colombia and bolstered their expansion in the U.S. and other foreign markets.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We employ a limited number of in-house sales employees. Most of our sales and marketing efforts are handled by area sales representatives who work on a commission basis.

&#160;

We do not rely on significant traditional advertising expenditures to drive net sales. We have established and maintain credibility primarily through the strength of our products, our customer service and quality assurance, the speed at which we deliver finished products and the attractiveness of our pricing. Our advertising expenditures consist primarily of maintaining our subsidiaries&#8217; websites.

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety and fire codes. Additionally, certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate require that installation of doors and windows be approved by competent authorities that grant distribution licenses.

&#160;

Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we spent approximately $2.0 and $1.3 million, respectively, in research and development.

&#160;

Our commercial ally and related party in the United States, ES Windows LLC, bears significant costs related to the development of new products, since they pay for the external tests that need to be performed on our products in order to comply with strict building codes. ES Windows LLC is fully permitted to commercialize hurricane windows in the Miami-Dade County, Florida, which has one of the most demanding certifications in the world of window frames.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 5,380 employees, with 3,251 employed by ES and 2,129 employed by Tecnoglass, none of whom is represented by a union. Most of our employees are hired through seven temporary staffing companies and are employed under one-year fixed-term employment contracts. Management believes it has good relations with our employees. We provide ongoing training programs to our employees through the self-established E.S. Windows University.

&#160;

Company History 

&#160;

We were formed under the name &#8220;Andina Acquisition Corporation&#8221; as an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on September 21, 2011 in order to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.

&#160;

In March, 2012, we closed our IPO of 4,200,000 units, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $8.00 per share, at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $42,000,000. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated a private placement of 4,800,000 warrants (&#8220;private warrants&#8221;) at a price of $0.50 per warrant and, to the underwriters, options to purchase an aggregate of 900,000 units at a price of $500,100, generating total proceeds of $2,900,100. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us were $43,163,000 of which $42,740,000 was deposited into a trust account. The remaining proceeds of $423,000 became available to be used as working capital to provide for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses. The IPO was conducted pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (Reg. No. 333-178061), that became effective on March 16, 2012.

&#160;

From the consummation of our IPO until August 17, 2013, we were searching for a suitable target business to acquire. On August 17, 2013, we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization, pursuant to which agreement, as amended, we acquired Tecnoglass Holding, Tecnoglass and ES as direct and indirect subsidiaries. On December 20, 2013, we held an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, at which our shareholders approved the Merger and other related proposals. On the same date, we closed the Merger and Tecnoglass Holding and its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tecnoglass and ES, became our direct and indirect subsidiaries.

&#160;

Tecnoglass Holding is a corporation formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands that was founded in 2014 in connection with the Merger. Tecnoglass is a corporation formed under the laws of Colombia that was founded in 1994 by Jose M. Daes, our Chief Executive Officer, and Christian T. Daes, our Chief Operating Officer. ES is a corporation formed under the laws of Colombia that was founded in 1984 by Jose M. Daes and Christian T. Daes.

&#160;

At the closing of the Merger, 2,251,853 of the 4,200,000 public shares sold in our IPO were converted to cash at a conversion price of approximately $10.18 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $22.9 million of the approximately $42.7 million held in the trust account. As consideration for the Merger, we issued Energy Holding Corp., a holding company and sole shareholder of Tecnoglass Holding, of which former shareholders of Tecnoglass and ES are the sole shareholders, an aggregate of 20,567,141 ordinary shares, or approximately 87% of the outstanding ordinary shares. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization, we also issued to Energy Holding Corp. an additional 500,000 ordinary shares upon the achievement of specified EBITDA targets in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 and we will issue 1,000,000 ordinary shares upon achievement of specified EBITDA target in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, Energy Holding Corp. also has the contractual right to receive an additional 1,500,000 ordinary shares, to be released upon the attainment of specified share price targets or targets based on our EBITDA in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.

&#160;

In connection with the Merger, we changed our name to &#8220;Tecnoglass Inc.&#8221; We also changed our fiscal year end from February 28 to December 31 in order to coincide with the fiscal year end of Tecnoglass Holding and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In 2014, we established two entities in South Florida, Tecno LLC and Tecno RE, to acquire manufacturing and sales-related assets to support sales and customer service in the United States.

&#160;

Additional Information About the Company

We maintain websites for our subsidiaries, TG and ES, which can be found at www.tecnoglass.com and www.energiasolarsa.com, respectively. Although we do not have a website dedicated to Tecnoglass Inc., the corporate filings of Tecnoglass Inc., including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statements and reports filed by our executive officers and directors under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and any amendments to those filings, are available free of charge on the Investor Relations page of each of the subsidiary websites, which are updated as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file (or furnish in certain cases) such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and can also be found at the SEC&#8217;s website at http://sec.gov. We do not intend for information contained in either subsidiary website, including the Investor Relations pages, to be a part of this Form 10-K. Also, the public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC&#8217; public reference room at 100 F St NE, Washington D.C, 20549 or by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

&#160;

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (or JOBS Act), and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. However, we have irrevocably opted not to take advantage of one such exemption which would have allowed us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are, and will continue to be, subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following March 22, 2017 (the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering). However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year.
