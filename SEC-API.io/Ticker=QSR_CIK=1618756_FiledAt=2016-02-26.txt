Explanatory Note 

On December 12, 2014, a series of transactions (the &#147;Transactions&#148;) were completed resulting in Burger King Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Burger King Worldwide&#148;), and Tim Hortons Inc., a Canadian corporation (&#147;Tim Hortons&#148;), becoming indirect subsidiaries of the Company and Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership (&#147;Partnership&#148;). 

We are the sole general partner of Partnership, which is the indirect parent of Tim Hortons and Burger King Worldwide. As a result of our controlling interest, we consolidate the financial results of Partnership and record a noncontrolling interest for the portion of Partnership we do not own in our consolidated financial statements. Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations presents the portion of earnings or loss attributable to the economic interest in Partnership owned by the holders of the noncontrolling interests. As sole general partner, we manage all of Partnership&#146;s operations and activities in accordance with the partnership agreement of Partnership (the &#147;partnership agreement&#148;). We have established a conflicts committee composed entirely of &#147;independent directors&#148; (as such term is defined in the partnership agreement) in order to consent to, approve or direct various enumerated actions on behalf of the Company (in its capacity as the general partner of Partnership) in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. 

Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), we are a successor issuer to Burger King Worldwide. On December 15, 2014, our common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#147;QSR&#148;. In addition, the Class B exchangeable limited partnership units of Partnership (the &#147;Partnership exchangeable units&#148;) are deemed to be registered under section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Partnership is subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. On December 15, 2014, the Partnership exchangeable units began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#147;QSP&#148;. 

Each of the Company and Partnership is a reporting issuer in each of the provinces and territories of Canada and, as a result, is subject to Canadian continuous disclosure and other reporting obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws. This Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes the Company&#146;s Annual Information Form for purposes of its Canadian continuous disclosure obligations under National Instrument 51-102 &#150; Continuous Disclosure Obligations (&#147;NI 51-102&#148;). Pursuant to an application for exemptive relief made in accordance with National Policy 11-203 &#150; Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions, Partnership has received exemptive relief dated October 31, 2014 from the Canadian securities regulators. This exemptive relief exempts Partnership from the continuous disclosure requirements of NI 51-102, effectively allowing Partnership to satisfy its Canadian continuous disclosure obligations by relying on the Canadian continuous disclosure documents filed by the Company, for so long as certain conditions are satisfied. Among these conditions is a requirement that Partnership concurrently send to all holders of the Partnership exchangeable units all disclosure materials that the Company sends to its shareholders and a requirement that Partnership separately report all material changes in respect of Partnership that are not also material changes in respect of the Company.

Business 

Company Overview 

We are a Canadian corporation originally formed on August 25, 2014 to serve as the indirect holding company for Tim Hortons and its consolidated subsidiaries and for Burger King Worldwide and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the world&#146;s largest quick service restaurant (&#147;QSR&#148;) companies with over 19,000 restaurants in approximately 100 countries and U.S. territories as of December 31, 2015. Our Tim Hortons &#174; and Burger King &#174; brands have similar franchise business models with complementary daypart mixes. Our two iconic brands are managed independently while benefitting from global scale and sharing of best practices. 

Our Tim Hortons Brand 

Founded in 1964, the Tim Hortons brand is one of the largest restaurant chains in North America and the largest in Canada. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or franchised a total of 4,413 Tim Hortons restaurants, including 3,650 in Canada, 650 in the United States and 113 in the Middle East. Of these restaurants, 4,389 were franchised (approximately 100%) and 24 were company-owned. 

Tim Hortons restaurants are quick service restaurants with a menu that includes premium blend coffee, tea, espresso-based hot and cold specialty drinks, fresh baked goods, including donuts, Timbits &#174; , bagels, muffins, cookies and pastries, grilled paninis, classic sandwiches, wraps, soups and more. 

Our Tim Hortons (&#147;TH&#148;) business generates revenue from four sources: (i) sales exclusive to Tim Hortons franchisees related to our supply chain operations, including manufacturing, procurement, warehousing and distribution, as well as sales to retailers; (ii) property revenues from properties we lease or sublease to franchisees; (iii) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; and (iv) sales at Company restaurants. 

Our Burger King Brand 

Founded in 1954, the Burger King brand is the world&#146;s second largest fast food hamburger restaurant (FFHR) chain as measured by total number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or franchised a total of 15,003 Burger King restaurants in approximately 100 countries and U.S. territories worldwide. Of these restaurants, 14,927 were franchised (approximately 100%) and 76 were company-owned. 

Burger King restaurants are quick service restaurants that feature flame-grilled hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks and other affordably-priced food items. Burger King restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, with multiple dayparts and product platforms appealing to different customer groups. During its over 60 years of operating history, the Burger King brand has developed a scalable and cost-efficient QSR hamburger restaurant model that offers guests fast and delicious food. 

Our Burger King (&#147;BK&#148;) business generates revenue from three sources: (i) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; (ii) property revenues from properties that we lease or sublease to franchisees; and (iii) sales at Company restaurants. 

Our Industry 

Both of our brands operate in the QSR segment of the restaurant industry. In the United States and Canada, the QSR segment is the largest segment of the restaurant industry and has demonstrated growth over a long period of time. According to The NPD Group, Inc. (&#147;NPD Group&#148;), which prepares and disseminates CREST &#174; data, QSR consumer spending in the United States and Canada totaled approximately $298 billion for the 12-month period ended November 2015. 

Our Tim Hortons brand operates in the donut/coffee/tea category of the QSR segment. According to NPD Group, the donut/coffee/tea category generated customer spending of approximately $8.7 billion in Canada for the 12-month period ended November 2015, representing 35% of total QSR consumer spending. According to NPD Group, for the 12-month period ended November 2015, Tim Hortons accounted for 45% of the Canadian QSR segment and 87% of the donut/coffee/tea category of the Canadian QSR segment, in each case based on the number of guests served.

Our Burger King brand operates in the FFHR category of the QSR segment. According to NPD Group, the FFHR category is the largest category in the QSR segment, generating consumer spending of $74.5 billion in the United States for the 12-month period ended November 2015, representing 27% of total QSR consumer spending. According to NPD Group, for the 12-month period ended November 2015, Burger King accounted for approximately 12% of total FFHR consumer spending in the United States.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

We believe that we have created a financially strong company built upon a foundation of two strong, thriving, independent brands with significant global growth potential and the opportunity to be one of the most efficient franchised QSR operators in the world. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Accelerate Global Restaurant Growth. We believe there is an attractive opportunity to grow the Tim Hortons and Burger King brands around the world by expanding our presence in existing markets and entering new markets where the brands are not present today. This strategy has been executed over the past five years with the Burger King brand and has led to a significant acceleration in restaurant growth. We are pursuing a similar strategy at TH to grow the brand&#146;s presence globally. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhance Guest Service and Experience at Our Restaurants. Guest satisfaction and providing a positive experience in our restaurants for our guests are integral to the success of our brands. We continue to focus on improving our level of service through comprehensive training, improved restaurant operations, reimaged restaurants and appealing menu options. Satisfied guests are more likely to return to our restaurants, which we believe will ultimately drive increased sales and profitability for our franchisees. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increase Restaurant Sales and Profitability. Restaurant sales and profitability are critical to the success of our franchise partners and our ability to grow our brands around the world. We believe that a focus on relevant menu innovation, operational simplification and excellence, compelling marketing communications and investment in a modern image for our restaurant base will allow us to continue to grow the same store sales of our existing restaurants. We are also focused on growing franchisee profitability by leveraging our global scale and using data to benchmark performance and identify areas of focus for our teams. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Become the Most Efficient Franchised QSR Operator through a Constant Focus on Costs and Sharing Best Practices. We have achieved significant cost efficiencies at TH and BK through a Zero Based Budgeting cost management system. This annual planning method is designed to build a strong ownership culture by requiring departmental budgets to estimate and justify costs and expenditures from a &#147;zero base,&#148; rather than focusing on the prior year&#146;s base. We have also begun to realize synergies across the two brands. We have implemented a global shared services platform and sharing of other non-brand dedicated functions such as finance, human resources, information technology, legal and others and the brands continue to share and leverage best practices. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Preserve Rich Heritages of Both Brands. Both Tim Hortons and Burger King continue to be managed as independent brands with separately managed franchisee relationships. TH has its brand headquarters in Oakville, Ontario and plays a prominent role in local communities through its work with certain charities such as the Tim Hortons Children&#146;s Foundation and the Timbits Minor Sports Program. The Burger King brand was founded in Miami over 60 years ago, and BK maintains its brand headquarters in Miami, Florida. BK is an active contributor to its local communities with a particular emphasis on education through the Burger King McLamore Foundation. Our Global Restaurant Operations 

Operating Segments 

Our business consisted of two segments at December 31, 2015. Our TH business is managed in one segment and our BK business is managed in the other segment. Additional financial information about segments can be found in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and Note 26 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(1) Excludes 398, 413 and 371 limited service kiosks as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015, we revised our presentation of restaurant counts to exclude limited service kiosks, with the revision applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented to provide period-to-period comparability. Of the total number of Tim Hortons restaurants as of December 31, 2015, 82.7% were located in Canada, 14.7% in the U.S. and 2.6% in the Middle East. In the U.S., Tim Hortons restaurants are located in 18 states, concentrated in the Northeast in New York, and in the Midwest in Michigan and Ohio. In Canada, Tim Hortons typically retains a controlling interest in the real estate for system restaurants that it develops by either owning the land and building, leasing the land and owning the building, or leasing both the land and building. 

As part of our development approach for Tim Hortons in the U.S., we have granted limited exclusivity rights in specific areas to developers in connection with area representative and area development agreements where the developers are investing their own capital to develop restaurants. We entered into two area representative and development agreements for the Cincinnati and Columbus designated market areas in 2015. We expect to enter into similar area development and area representative arrangements in the U.S. in 2016. In Canada, we have not granted exclusive or protected areas to any Tim Hortons franchisees. 

Historically, international activities have not contributed significantly to Tim Hortons financial results. We have agreements with Apparel FZCO for the development and operation of Tim Hortons restaurants in the Middle East. We continue to work towards leveraging our master franchise joint venture model, network of global partners and experienced global development teams to substantially accelerate Tim Hortons international growth over time to bring this iconic brand to the rest of the world. 

Of the total number of Burger King restaurants as of December 31, 2015, 47.5% were located in the U.S. and 52.5% were located in our markets outside of the U.S. Since 2010, the Burger King brand has increased annual net restaurant growth by approximately four times, reaching 631 net new units in 2015 from 173 new units in 2010 and making it one of the fastest growing QSRs in the world. 

As part of our international growth strategy for the Burger King brand, we have created strategic master franchise joint ventures in a number of markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (&#147;EMEA&#148;), Asia Pacific (&#147;APAC&#148;) and Latin America and the Caribbean (&#147;LAC&#148;) and received a meaningful minority equity stake in each joint venture. We have also entered into master franchise and development agreements in a number of markets across EMEA, APAC and LAC with well-capitalized partners supported by strong local management teams. Our partners make substantial upfront equity commitments and agree to aggressive development targets. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate development of our Burger King brand, including through the establishment of master franchises with exclusive development rights and joint ventures with new and existing franchisees. We believe there are significant growth opportunities throughout EMEA, APAC and LAC. 

Advertising and Promotions 

In general, franchisees fund substantially all of the marketing programs for our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands by making contributions ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% of gross sales to advertising funds that we manage. Advertising contributions are used to pay for expenses relating to marketing, advertising and promotion, including market research, production, advertising costs, sales promotions and other support functions for the respective brands. 

We manage the advertising funds for both of our brands in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in other markets where Burger King Worldwide has historically operated Company restaurants. However, in many of BK&#146;s international markets, including the markets managed by master franchisees, franchisees make contributions into franchisee-managed advertising funds. As part of our global marketing strategy, we provide Burger King franchisees with advertising support and guidance in order to deliver a consistent global brand message. 

&#160;

Product Development 

New product development is a key driver of the long-term success for both of our brands. We believe the development of new products can drive traffic by expanding our customer base, allowing restaurants to expand into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste. Product innovation begins with an intensive, data-driven research and development process that analyzes potential new menu items, including extensive consumer testing and ongoing analysis of the economics of food cost, margin and final price point. 

A core strategy and success for our Tim Hortons brand remains a strong pipeline of differentiated product innovation. In 2015, we solidified previous innovation successes including Dark Roast Coffee and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. In 2015, we had additional innovation successes, including Nutella based products, our grilled wraps and the Creamy Chocolate Chill &#174; beverage. We plan to maintain brand focus on leveraging our strength in hot and cold beverage while expanding our daypart presence with exciting new food and baked good offerings. 

In 2015, we continued to implement our strategy for the Burger King brand of launching fewer, more impactful products to simplify in-restaurant operations and reduce waste, focus the innovation pipeline and spend media dollars more wisely in a few high-impact areas. We believe that we have had significant successes on each of these fronts and this, paired with our continued compelling value offerings, have translated to significant momentum for the brand in 2015. This strategy will continue to be a focus of the brand for 2016 and beyond. 

Operations Support 

Our operations strategy is designed to deliver best-in-class restaurant operations by Tim Hortons and Burger King franchisees and improve friendliness, cleanliness, speed of service and overall guest satisfaction to drive long-term growth. Both of our brands have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to product quality, cleanliness and maintenance of the premises. In addition, Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with quality assurance and health standards which each brand has established, as well as standards set by applicable governmental laws and regulations. Each franchisee typically participates in initial and ongoing training programs to learn all aspects of operating a Tim Hortons or Burger King restaurant in accordance with each brand&#146;s operating standards. 

Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution 

In general, we approve the manufacturers of the food, packaging and equipment products and other products used in our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants. We have a comprehensive supplier approval process, which requires all products to pass our quality standards and the supplier&#146;s manufacturing process and facilities to pass on-site food safety inspections. Our franchisees are required to purchase substantially all food and other products from approved suppliers and distributors. 

Tim Hortons products are sourced from a combination of third-party suppliers and our own manufacturing facilities. We operate two wholly-owned coffee roasting facilities in Hamilton, Ontario and Rochester, New York, where we blend all of the coffee for our Tim Hortons restaurants to protect the proprietary blend of our premium restaurant coffee and, where practical, for our take home, packaged coffee. Our fondant and fills manufacturing facility produces, and is the primary supplier of, the ready-to-use glaze, fondants and fills which are used in connection with a number of Tim Hortons products. We currently purchase all of our donuts and Timbits &#174; from a single supplier. 

We sell most other raw materials and supplies, including coffee, sugar, paper goods and other restaurant supplies, to Tim Hortons restaurants. We purchase those raw materials from multiple suppliers and generally have alternative sources of supply for each. While we have multiple suppliers for coffee from various coffee-producing regions, the available supply and price for high-quality coffee beans can fluctuate dramatically. Accordingly, we monitor world market conditions for green (unroasted) coffee and contract for future supply volumes to obtain expected requirements of high-quality coffee beans at acceptable prices. 

Our TH business has significant supply chain operations, including procurement, warehousing and distribution, to supply paper and dry goods to a substantial majority of our Canadian restaurants, and procure and supply frozen baked goods and some refrigerated products to most of our Ontario and Quebec restaurants. We act as a distributor to Tim Hortons restaurants in Canada through five distribution centers located in Canada. We own or lease a significant number of trucks and trailers that regularly deliver to most of our Canadian restaurants. In the U.S., we supply similar products to system restaurants through third-party distributors. 

All of the products used in our Burger King restaurants are sourced from third-party suppliers. Restaurant Services, Inc. (&#147;RSI&#148;) is the purchasing agent for the Burger King system in the United States and negotiates the purchase terms for most equipment, food, beverages (other than branded soft drinks) and other products used in Burger King restaurants. RSI is also authorized to purchase and manage distribution services on behalf of most of the Burger King restaurants in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, four distributors serviced approximately 88.7% of U.S. system restaurants and the loss of any one of these distributors would likely adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

In 2000, Burger King Corporation entered into long-term exclusive contracts with The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. to supply Burger King restaurants with their products and which obligate restaurants in the United States to purchase a specified number of gallons of soft drink syrup. These volume commitments are not subject to any time limit. As of December 31, 2015, we estimate that it will take approximately 15 years to complete the Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. purchase commitments. If these agreements were terminated, we would be obligated to pay an aggregate amount equal to approximately $530 million as of December 31, 2015 based on an amount per gallon for each gallon of soft drink syrup remaining in the purchase commitments, interest and certain other costs. 

In 2014, Tim Hortons entered into an agreement with a supplier requiring minimum purchase obligations, within the normal course of operations. As of December 31, 2015, there is a minimum purchase obligation based on a percentage of our requirements of approximately $92 million remaining over a four year term. 

Franchise Agreements and Other Arrangements 

General. We grant franchises to operate restaurants using Tim Hortons and Burger King trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property, uniform operating procedures, consistent quality of products and services and standard procedures for inventory control and management. For each franchise restaurant, we generally enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions. Recurring fees consist of periodic royalty and advertising payments. Franchisees report gross sales on a monthly or weekly basis and pay royalties based on gross sales. 

Franchise agreements are generally not assignable without our consent. Our Tim Hortons franchise agreements grant us the right to reacquire a restaurant under certain circumstances, and our Burger King franchise agreements generally have a right of first refusal if a franchisee proposes to sell a restaurant. Defaults (including non-payment of royalties or advertising contributions, or failure to operate in compliance with our standards) can lead to termination of the franchise agreement . 

U.S. and Canada. Tim Hortons franchisees in the U.S. and Canada operate under several types of license agreements, with a typical term for a standard restaurant of 10 years plus renewal period(s) of approximately 10 years in the aggregate. Tim Hortons franchisees who lease land and/or buildings from us typically pay a royalty of 3.0% to 4.5% of weekly restaurant gross sales. Under a separate lease or sublease, Tim Hortons franchisees typically pay monthly rent based on a percentage (usually 8.5% to 10.0%) of monthly gross sales or flow through monthly rent based on the terms of an underlying lease. Where the franchisee owns the premises, leases it from a third party or enters into a flow through lease with Tim Hortons, the royalty is typically increased. In addition, the royalty rates under license agreements entered into in connection with non-standard restaurants, including self-serve kiosks and strategic alliances with third parties, may vary from those described above and are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 

For some existing Tim Hortons franchisees in Canada and the U.S., we have entered into operator agreements, in which the operator acquires the right to operate a Tim Hortons restaurant, but we continue to be the owner of the equipment, signage and trade fixtures. Such arrangements usually require the operator to pay approximately 20% of the restaurant&#146;s weekly gross sales to us. These operators also make the required contributions to our advertising funds, described above. In any such arrangement, we and the operator each have the option to terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#146; notice. 

The typical Burger King franchise agreement in the U.S. and Canada has a 20-year term (for both initial grants and renewals of franchises) and contemplates a one-time franchise fee which must be paid in full before the restaurant opens for business, or in the case of renewal, before expiration of the current franchise term. Subject to the incentive programs described below, most new Burger King franchise restaurants pay a royalty of 4.5% in the United States. 

In an effort to improve the image of our restaurants in the United States, we offered Burger King franchisees in the U.S. reduced up-front franchise fees and limited-term royalty and advertising fund rate reductions to remodel restaurants to our modern image during 2014 and 2015 and we plan to continue to offer remodel incentives to U.S. franchisees during 2016. At December 31, 2015, approximately 50% of the U.S. system was on the modern image. These limited-term incentive programs are expected to negatively impact our effective royalty rate until 2021. However, we expect this impact to be partially mitigated as we will also be entering into new franchise agreements for Burger King restaurants in the United States with a 4.5% royalty rate. 

International. Historically, we entered into franchise agreements for each Burger King restaurant in our international markets with up-front franchise fees and monthly royalties and advertising contributions each of up to 5.0% of gross sales. However, as part of our international growth strategy, we have increasingly entered into master franchise agreements or development agreements that grant franchisees exclusive development rights and, in some cases, require them to provide support services to other franchisees in their markets. The up-front franchise fees and royalty rate paid by master franchisees vary from country to country, depending on the facts and circumstances of each market. We have agreements with Apparel FZCO for the development and operation of Tim Hortons restaurants in the Middle East. Under these agreements, Apparel pays us up-front franchise fees upon the opening of each location, monthly royalties, and product and equipment sales. 

&#160;

Franchise Restaurant Leases. We leased or subleased 3,565 properties to Tim Hortons franchisees and 1,847 properties to Burger King franchisees as of December 31, 2015 pursuant to separate lease agreements with these franchisees. For properties that we lease from third-party landlords and sublease to franchisees, our leases generally provide for fixed rental payments and may provide for contingent rental payments based on a restaurant&#146;s annual gross sales. Franchisees who lease land only or land and building from us do so on a &#147;triple net&#148; basis. Under these triple net leases, the franchisee is obligated to pay all costs and expenses, including all real property taxes and assessments, repairs and maintenance and insurance. 

Intellectual Property 

We own valuable intellectual property relating to our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands, including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information. We have established the standards and specifications for most of the goods and services used in the development, improvement and operation of our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants. These proprietary standards, specifications and restaurant operating procedures are our trade secrets. Additionally, we own certain patents of varying duration relating to equipment used in Burger King restaurants. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 491 Tim Hortons trademark and service mark registrations and applications and 592 domain name registrations around the world, some of which are of material importance to our TH business. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 4,604 Burger King trademark and service mark registrations and applications and approximately 1,044 domain name registrations around the world, some of which are of material importance to our BK business. 

Competition 

Our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands compete in the United States, Canada and internationally with many well-established food service companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. Our competitors include a variety of independent local operators, in addition to well-capitalized regional, national and international restaurant chains and franchises. We also compete for consumer dining dollars with national, regional and local (i) quick service restaurants that offer alternative menus, (ii) casual and &#147;fast casual&#148; restaurant chains and (iii) convenience stores and grocery stores. Tim Hortons competitors range from small local independent operators to well-capitalized national and regional chains, such as Dunkin&#146; Donuts, McDonald&#146;s, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Subway and Wendy&#146;s. Additionally, Tim Hortons competes with alternative methods of brewed coffee for home use. In the FFHR industry, Burger King&#146;s principal competitors are McDonald&#146;s and Wendy&#146;s, as well as regional hamburger restaurant chains, such as Carl&#146;s Jr., Jack in the Box and Sonic. 

The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time. 

Government Regulations and Affairs 

General. As manufacturers and distributors of food products, we and our franchisees are subject to licensing and regulation by federal, state, provincial, and/or municipal departments relating to the environment, health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards and, for our distribution business, traffic and transportation regulations; federal, provincial, and state labor laws (including applicable minimum wage requirements, temporary foreign workers, overtime, working and safety conditions and employment eligibility requirements); federal, provincial, and state laws prohibiting discrimination; federal, provincial, state and local tax laws and regulations; and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and similar Canadian federal and provincial legislation that can have a significant impact on our franchisees and our performance. These regulations include food safety regulations, including supervision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its international equivalents, which govern the manufacture, labeling, packaging and safety of food. In addition, we are or may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat, high-calorie and high-sodium foods, particularly in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain. Certain counties, states and municipalities have approved menu labeling legislation that requires restaurant chains to provide caloric information on menu boards, and menu labeling legislation has also been adopted on the federal level. 

U.S. and Canada. We and our franchisees are subject to Canadian and U.S. laws affecting the operation of their restaurants and their business. Each Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurant must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. We and our franchisees are also subject to laws governing union organizing, working conditions, work authorization requirements, health insurance, overtime and wages. 

In the U.S., we are subject to federal franchising laws adopted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;). In addition, a number of states in the U.S., and the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, New Brunswick and British Columbia, have enacted or are in the final stages of enacting legislation that affects companies involved in franchising. Much of the legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at providing detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee, duties of good faith as between the franchisor and the franchisee, and/or periodic registration by the franchisor with applicable regulatory agencies. Additionally, some U.S. states have enacted or are considering enacting legislation that governs the termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement and other aspects of the franchise relationship. 

&#160;

International. Internationally, we and our franchisees are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting them and their franchisees in Canada and the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchising, zoning, health, safety, sanitation, and building and fire codes. We and our franchisees are also subject to a variety of tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment. 

Environmental Matters 

We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulations. Various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and restaurant waste and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations and the operations of our franchisees; however, compliance with applicable environmental regulations is not believed to have a material effect on capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, or our competitive position. Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. To the extent that these initiatives cause an increase in our supply or distribution costs, they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Furthermore, climate change may exacerbate adverse weather conditions, which could adversely impact our operations and/or increase the cost of our food and other supplies in ways that we cannot predict at this time. 

Seasonal Operations 

Our TH and BK businesses are moderately seasonal. Our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurant sales are typically higher in the spring and summer months when the weather is warmer than in the fall and winter months. Our restaurant sales are typically lowest during the winter months, which include February, the shortest month of the year. Furthermore, adverse weather conditions can have material adverse effects on restaurant sales. The timing of holidays may also impact restaurant sales. Because our businesses are moderately seasonal, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 

Our Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 4,300 employees in our restaurant support centers, regional offices, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, field operations and Company restaurants. Our franchisees are independent business owners so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count.
