 Item 1. 

Business 

We are a diverse, 137-year-old media enterprise with interests in television and radio broadcasting, as well as local and national digital media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is "Give light and the people will find their own way." Our mission is to do well by doing good &#8212; providing value to customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses through a growing portfolio of television, radio and digital media brands. We also operate an expanding collection of local and national digital journalism and information businesses including our podcast business, Midroll Media, and over-the-top ("OTT") video news service, Newsy. We also produce television programming, run an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of the nation's largest, most successful and longest-running educational program, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our media companies and their associated websites, visit http://www.scripps.com. 

On April 1, 2015, Scripps and Journal Communications, Inc. ("Journal") closed the merger of their broadcast operations and spin-off of their newspaper businesses into a separate publicly traded company. Upon completion of the transactions, Scripps shareholders received 0.25 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group for each share of Scripps stock. A $60 million special cash dividend, which was approximately $1.00 per share, was also paid to the Scripps shareholders. Journal shareholders received 0.195 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group and 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps for each share of Journal stock. 

The merged broadcast operations, which retained The E. W. Scripps Company name, is one of the nation&#8217;s largest independent TV station ownership groups, reaching nearly one in five U.S. television households and serving 24 markets. We also own 34 radio stations in eight markets. The company has approximately 3,800 employees across its television, radio and digital media operations. The merger enhances our national broadcast footprint, and we now have affiliations with all of the "Big 4" television networks. &#32; 

The merger with the Journal broadcast business further leverages Scripps' digital investments, adding large and attractive markets to the portfolio, including Nashville, Las Vegas and Milwaukee. The company is expecting to build and launch market-leading digital brands that serve growing digital media audiences, in addition to supporting the on-air local news brands. 

In 2011, we signaled our commitment to developing our digital media business by combining all of our digital initiatives into a single organization. Under the direction of our digital leadership, this focus allows us to find new and efficient platforms for bringing together advertisers and audiences. After completing the Journal transactions in 2015, we began reporting digital as a segment. 

We continued our expansion of our national digital business with the July 22, 2015 acquisition of Midroll Media, a Los Angeles-based company that creates original podcasts and operates a network that sells advertising for more than 200 shows, including &#8220;WTF with Marc Maron" and "Comedy Bang! Bang!&#8221; The purchase price was $50 million in cash, plus a $10 million earnout provision. 

On June 16, 2014, we acquired two television stations owned by Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $110 million in cash. The acquisition included an ABC-affiliated station in Buffalo and a MyNetworkTV affiliate in Detroit that is now operated as a duopoly with our ABC affiliate. 

On January 1, 2014, we acquired Media Convergence Group, which operates as Newsy, a video news provider, for $35 million in &#32;cash. Newsy adds a new dimension to our video news strategy with a storytelling approach, specifically geared toward OTT audiences. 

On December 30, 2011, we acquired the television station group owned by McGraw-Hill Broadcasting Company, Inc. for $212 million in cash. The acquisition included four ABC-affiliated television stations, as well as five Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates.

TELEVISION 

Scripps has operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when it launched Ohio&#8217;s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately 18% &#32;of the nation&#8217;s television households and includes 15 ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates, two CBS affiliates and four non big-four affiliated stations. We also own five Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. In five of our markets, we operate both television and radio stations. Multiple properties in the same market help us to better serve advertisers, viewers and listeners and help improve our operating efficiencies. 

We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages local and national communities. We distribute our content on four platforms &#8212; &#32;broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries. 

We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations' efforts to expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a &#8220;hyper-local&#8221; strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. 

In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and internally produced programming. We have implemented a strategy to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with internally developed programming. We currently air three original shows, The List, The Now , and RightThisMinute . The List &#32;is an Emmy award winning infotainment show aired on weeknights. The Now &#32;is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive into the day's events. RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. We wholly own The List &#32;and The Now &#32;and are a partner in RightThisMinute . These three shows have replaced expensive syndicated content in the markets in which they air. We intend to roll them out in the rest of our markets when commitments to air syndicated programming expire. In the upcoming years, we look to further expand our programming strategy of creating internally produced content and syndicating these shows. We believe this strategy has the potential to improve our television division's financial performance for years to come.

All market and audience data is based on the November 2015 Nielsen survey, live viewing plus 7 days of viewing on DVR. 

(1) 

Market rank represents the relative size of the television market in the United States. 

(2) 

Stations in Market represents stations within the Designated Market Area per the Nielsen survey excluding public broadcasting stations, satellite stations, and low-power stations. 

(3) 

Station Rank in Market is based on Average Audience Share as described in (5). 

(4) 

Percentage of U.S. Television Households in Market represents the number of U.S. television households in Designated Market Area as a percentage of total U.S. television households. 

(5) 

Average Audience Share represents the number of television households tuned to a specific station from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. M-SU, as a percentage of total viewing households in the Designated Market Area. 

Historically, we have been successful in renewing our expiring FCC licenses. 

We operate five low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our California and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID. 

Revenue cycles and sources 

Advertising 

We sell advertising to local, national and political customers. The sale of local, national and political commercial spots accounted for 76% &#32;of the television segment&#8217;s revenues in 2015 . Pricing of advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our television stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors&#8217; television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail. 

Local advertising time is sold by each station&#8217;s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. 

National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and national retailers. 

Political advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, senate and house of representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to Political Action Groups or other advocacy groups. 

Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control. 

Advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising preceding the presidential election. Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance of even-numbered years to odd numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed. 

Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters. 

Retransmission Revenues 

We earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 22% &#32;of television segment operating revenues in 2015 . The MVPDs are cable operators and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market. There are approximately 19 &#32;million subscribers to MVPD services in our markets. As of January 1, 2016, we have renewed contracts covering approximately 3 million subscribers. When we have renewed retransmission consent agreements, they have generally been at higher rates. 

Prior to the spin-off in 2008 of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), we granted retransmission rights to MVPDs in exchange for carriage of cable networks. Pursuant to an agreement entered into as part of the spin-off, SNI pays us an annual fee for carriage of our broadcast signals by Comcast, limited to the television stations owned prior to the 2008 spin-off. This agreement with SNI expires at the end of 2019, when we expect to renew our retransmission agreement with Comcast for all of our current markets. 

Our retransmission consent agreements with MVPD providers expire at various dates through 2019. The approximate number of subscribers to those services by year of expiration is as follows: 4 million in 2016, 2 million in 2017, 6 million in 2018 and 7 million in 2019. We expect our retransmission consent agreements with MVPD providers to be renewed upon expiration. 

Other 

FCC rules allow broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. With these additional channels we may broadcast our own programs or programming of other providers such as Grit, Laff, Escape and Bounce. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our spectrum with the goal of achieving higher profits and community service. 

In addition to selling commercials during our programming, we also offer marketing opportunities for our business customers, including sponsorships and community events. 

Expenses 

Employee costs accounted for 52% &#32;of segment costs and expenses in 2015 . 

We have been centralizing certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. 

Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 24% &#32;of total segment costs and expenses in 2015 . 

Our network-affiliated stations pay the networks for the programming that is supplied to us in various dayparts. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration. 

RADIO 

In 2015, Scripps acquired the Journal broadcast group which included 34 radio stations in eight markets. We operate 28 FM stations and six AM stations. 

We employ a variety of sales-related and programming strategies to maximize our share of the advertising spending. We have aligned our radio stations in clusters within a market, building each cluster around a lead station. We seek to create unique and differentiated brand positions at each station within a cluster so that we can offer distinct solutions for a variety of advertisers in each of our markets. This approach has allowed us to target our stations' formats and sales efforts to better serve advertisers and listeners, as well as leverage operating expenses to maximize the performance of each station and the cluster. 

Our radio stations focus on providing targeted and relevant local programming that is responsive to the interest of the communities in which we serve, strengthening our brand identity and allowing us to provide effective marketing solutions for advertisers by reaching their targeted audiences. 

Our Milwaukee radio station, WTMJ-AM, currently maintains exclusive radio broadcast rights for the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers and operates a statewide network for their games.

Station Market Rank equals the ranking of each station in its market, according to the Fall 2015 Nielson audio survey. The diary ranking is determined based on the estimated share of persons 12 years and older and the Portable People Meter ("PPM") ranking is based on the estimated share of persons six years and older listening during an average 15-minute increment (also knows as "average quarterly hour," or "AQH," share) occurring Monday-Sunday between 6:00 a.m. and midnight. 

(2) 

Includes stations qualified to be reported in the Fall 2015 Arbitron ratings book. To be reported in a diary market, a station must have met the following requirements among persons 12 years and older occurring Monday-Sunday between 6:00 a.m. and midnight: 

a. 

Must be credited for at least one quarter-hour in at least 10 in-tab diaries, have a metro cume rating of 0.495 or greater and a metro AQH rating of 0.05 or greater. 

b. 

Must have received at least one quarter-hour of listening credit from at least one in-tab panelist and have a metro cume rating of 0.495 or greater.

Revenue sources 

Advertising 

The primary source of revenue for our radio stations is from the sale of advertising to local advertisers. We also sell non-traditional advertising, which includes initiatives to attract new local advertisers, such as the creation of new content and programs that combine television or radio with digital, national and political advertising. Although it is not as significant as in the television segment, our radio stations may benefit from political advertising in even numbered years. 

We strive to maximize revenue dollars through the broadcast of commercials without diminishing listening levels. While the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year, unless there has been a format change. 

Other 

Other revenue includes the sports affiliation fees we receive at WTMJ-AM for the statewide broadcast of the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers. We also offer marketing opportunities for our customers, including sponsorships and community events. 

Expenses 

Employee costs accounted for 48% &#32;of segment costs and expenses in 2015 . 

Programming costs, which are comprised primarily of music license fees and sports rights fees, were 23% &#32;of total segment costs and expenses in 2015. We pay music license fees to performing rights organizations which allows us to broadcast music. The sports rights fees include the costs for our exclusive rights to broadcast the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers. 

Federal Regulation of Broadcasting &#32; &#8212; &#32;Broadcast television and radio are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children's television programming and limiting commercial content therein, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC&#8217;s rules and regulations, and the FCC&#8217;s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC&#8217;s extensive regulation of broadcasting. 

Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee's performance. All the Company&#8217;s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms except for the timely-filed application of radio station KEZO-FM, Omaha, NE, which license remains in effect pending processing by the FCC. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term. 

FCC regulations govern the ownership of radio and television stations and other media. Under the FCC's current rules, a license for a television station will generally not be granted or renewed if the grant of the license would result in (i) the applicant owning or controlling more than one television station, or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations in the same market (the &#8220;television duopoly rule&#8221;), or (ii) the applicant owning or controlling television stations whose total national audience reach exceeds 39% of all television households. The Company enjoys a waiver of this television duopoly rule in the Green Bay, Wisconsin market. 

A television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station&#8217;s weekly programming will be deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC&#8217;s ownership limits. The FCC in 2014 modified its rules to impose this duopoly rule's restrictions on separately-owned television stations within a market that engage in joint advertising sales, and it is considering imposing disclosure and other limits on local stations that share facilities or services such as program production. Each of stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, is a party to a shared services agreement with another local station pursuant to which it provides, among other services, less than 15% of the other station&#8217;s weekly programming. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to a joint advertising agreement with a local station that would be subject to the revised rule&#8217;s requirements, but Congress has granted such stations a &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; status that will permit continuation of these agreements without attribution through 2025. 

The FCC&#8217;s local radio ownership rule limits the number of radio stations an entity may own in a given market depending on the size of that radio market. Specifically, in a radio market with 45 or more commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM). In a radio market with between 30 and 44 radio stations, a party may own or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service. In a radio market with between 15 and 29 radio stations, a party may own or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service. In a radio market with 14 or fewer radio stations, a party may own or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service, except that a party may not own or control more than 50% of the stations in the market, except for combinations of one AM and one FM station. The FCC relies on Nielson to define the radio market in most areas of the country, but for stations outside a Nielson-defined market this definition depends upon a technical analysis of the stations&#8217; service areas. A radio station that provides more than 15% of another in-market station&#8217;s weekly programming or sells more than 15% of another in-market station&#8217;s weekly advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the ownership rule limits. 

The FCC&#8217;s radio-television cross-ownership rule separately limits broadcast ownership, generally allowing: common ownership of one or two television stations and up to six radio stations, or, in certain circumstances, one television station and seven radio stations in any market where at least 20 independent voices would remain after the combination; two television stations and up to four radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent voices would remain after the combination; and one television and one radio station notwithstanding the number of independent voices in the market. A &#8220;voice&#8221; under this rule generally includes independently owned and locally-received commercial and noncommercial broadcast television and radio stations, significant local newspapers, and one local cable system. 

The restrictions imposed by the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC&#8217;s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws. 

The FCC routinely reviews its ownership rules, and we cannot predict the outcome of the FCC&#8217;s ongoing reconsideration of these ownership issues or the effect of any FCC revision of these ownership policies on our stations' operations or our business. 

In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, Congress has granted the FCC authority to conduct spectrum auctions in which some television broadcasters would voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. The FCC has begun the process of conducting an auction to purchase television broadcast spectrum and intends to complete the auction during 2016. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC&#8217;s approach to the post-auction &#8220;repacking&#8221; of the remaining television stations into the reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations&#8217; over-the-air service and may particularly disadvantage any stations that are relocated to the frequencies that will then be employed for wireless service purposes in other geographic areas. Broadcasters also are concerned that the FCC&#8217;s post-auction plans do not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use and that there will not be adequate compensation for those stations that are required to change facilities due to repacking. Implementing the post-auction changes in stations' frequencies and tower site locations may be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders are at particular risk of service loss and difficulty in finding alternative transmitter sites due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about potential difficulties, such as a lack of available 

qualified tower crews for the significant number of moves that may be required, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it plans to impose a &#8220;hard&#8221; deadline that could require a station that is unable to relocate in time to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though its new facility is not yet ready to provide service. 

Separately, the FCC has expanded its commitment to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the &#8220;white spaces&#8221; between television stations' protected service areas despite broadcasters&#8217; concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC has tentatively decided to further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving one or two 6 MHz channels in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the &#8220;broadcast&#8221; band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only &#8220;secondary&#8221; status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business. 

Broadcast television stations generally enjoy &#8220;must-carry&#8221; rights on any cable television system defined as &#8220;local&#8221; with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations. 

In accord with a Congressional directive, the FCC has recently initiated a new rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency&#8217;s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in &#8220;good faith.&#8221; While the FCC has previously concluded that it lacks authority to require arbitration or mandate station carriage, it has restricted the practice whereby some independently-owned stations in a market would jointly negotiate retransmission consent rights, and it is seeking additional comment on whether it should eliminate its &#8220;network nonduplication&#8221; and &#8220;syndicated exclusivity&#8221; rules that permit broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC's processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company. 

Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts are reexamining policies that have protected television stations' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;), such as cable operators and satellite systems. This proceeding raises a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs' statutory copyright licensing rights. Other ongoing copyright-related controversies involve, for example, the legality of digital recorders or Internet-based recording services that can automatically remove commercials from television broadcast programming during playback. We cannot predict the outcome of these and other proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company. 

Radio station revenues are subject to the regulatory decisions of the Copyright Royalty Board (&#8220;CRB&#8221;) which sets rates for broadcasters&#8217; royalty payments to music copyright holders for the performance of their works. Whether radio stations should also pay royalties to music performers is a long-standing and controversial topic before Congress. We cannot predict the impact that future decisions of the CRB or Congress with respect to these matters might have upon our radio stations&#8217; revenues or their possible impact on the Company. 

During recent years, the FCC has significantly increased the penalties it imposes for violations of its rules and policies. For example, a recent settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station&#8217;s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC's authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as broadcasting proper emergency alerts and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC&#8217;s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company. 

DIGITAL 

Our digital segment includes a collection of local and national digital brands. The local brands consist of our television and radio station websites, as well as the related smartphone and tablet apps, which earn revenues from advertising sales and related digital advertising products and marketing services. Our local digital sites offer comprehensive local news, information and user-generated content, as well as national content and other content sources. We continue to enhance our online and digital services using features such as long-form text articles in addition to streaming video and audio, to deliver news and information. Many of our journalists routinely produce videos for consumption through our digital platforms and use an array of social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, to communicate with and build our audiences. We have embraced mobile technology by offering our products on apps available on the Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows platforms. During the fourth quarter of 2015 our local markets served 253 million page views and had an average of 21.7 million unique users; we had approximately 950,000 monthly active users of our local, mobile and tablet apps; and combined, our local websites and mobile products delivered approximately 25 million video views. 

The national digital brands compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where audience and revenue growth are the fastest, such as over-the-top (OTT) audio and video. OTT refers to the delivery of audio, video and other media over the Internet through third parties such as Hulu, Netflix, HBO NOW and Sling TV. Consumers can access the OTT content through internet-connected devices such as computers, gaming consoles (such as PlayStation or Xbox), set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. A podcast is a digital audio recording, usually part of a themed series, which can be downloaded from the Internet to a media player or computer. Both OTT video and audio-podcasting platforms enable us to expand our reach and number of viewers beyond that of our local audience and also enable us to attract a variety of different advertisers. 

Our national digital brands includes Newsy and Midroll Media (Midroll). Newsy is an OTT video news service focused on the millennial generation that brings perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Roku users spent an average of 27 minutes per session watching Newsy content. Apple TV named Newsy to its "Best of 2015" app list. Another national digital brand, Midroll, is a podcast industry leader that creates original podcasts and operates a network that generates revenue for more than 200 shows, with on-air talent such as Marc Maron and Bill Simmons. Midroll also has a subscription service called Howl which operates through a smartphone app that makes it easier to find and engage with podcasts. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Midroll's podcasts were downloaded an average of 113 million times per month. 

Revenue sources 

Digital advertising 

Our local and national digital operations earn revenue primarily through the sale of advertising to local and national customers. Digital advertising includes fixed-duration campaigns whereby, for a fee, a video preroll, a banner, text or other advertisement appears for a specified period of time; impression-based campaigns where the fee is based on the number of times the advertisement appears in webpages viewed by a user; and click-through campaigns where the fee is based on the number of users who click on an advertisement and are directed to the advertisers&#8217; websites. We use a variety of audience-extension programs to enhance the reach of our websites and garner a larger share of advertising dollars that are spent online. 

Another source of advertising revenue comes from our national digital brand Midroll, which earns revenue from the sale of advertisement spots on its original podcasts which it creates and distributes through its owned-and-operated networks, Earwolf and Wolfpop. 

Other 

Other revenue sources primarily include digital marketing and subscription services. 

We offer our local advertising customers additional marketing services, such as managing their search engine marketing campaigns. Additionally, Midroll acts as a sales and marketing representative by working with advertisers to connect them to a specific podcast based on the advertiser's desired target audience. 

The primary source of subscription revenue comes from Howl, which is a subscription service launched by Midroll in August 2015, where users pay a standard monthly fee for access to premium content service. 

Expenses 

Employee costs accounted for 68% &#32;of segment costs and expenses in 2015 . 

Other segment costs and expenses in 2015 were attributable to news coverage costs, network and digital hosting costs and other miscellaneous expenses. 

Syndication and Other 

Syndication and other primarily includes the syndication of news features and comics and other features for the newspaper industry. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 3,800 &#32;full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 2,800 were with television, 400 with radio and 400 with our digital operations. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in television. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.
