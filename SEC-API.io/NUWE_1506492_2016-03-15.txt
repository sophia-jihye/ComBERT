Overview 

&#160; 

Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context, &#147;Sunshine Heart,&#148; &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and &#147;our&#148; refer to Sunshine Heart, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

We are an early-stage medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing our C-Pulse &#174; Heart Assist System (the &#147;C-Pulse System&#148; ) for treatment of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure. The C-Pulse System utilizes the known concept of counterpulsation applied in an extra-aortic approach to assist the left ventricle by reducing the workload required to pump blood throughout the body, while increasing blood flow to the coronary arteries.

&#160; 

We are in the process of pursuing regulatory approvals necessary to sell our system in the United States. We completed enrollment of our North American feasibility clinical study in the first half of 2011. In November 2011, we announced the preliminary results of the six-month follow-up period for the feasibility study and we submitted the clinical data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#147;FDA&#148; ). In March 2012, the FDA notified us that it had completed its review of the C-Pulse System feasibility study data and concluded we met the applicable agency requirements, and further indicated that we could move forward with an investigational device exemption ( &#147;IDE&#148; ) application. In October 2012, we announced the results of the 12-month follow-up period for the feasibility study. In November 2012, the FDA provided us with unconditional approval to initiate a pivotal study and we commenced enrollment in our COUNTER HF&#153; study in September 2013. The COUNTER HF study was designed to enroll 388 patients randomized 1:1 to treatment (C-Pulse implantation) versus optimal medical therapy, at up to 40 participating hospitals and clinics. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as freedom from worsening heart failure resulting in hospitalization, LVAD implantation, cardiac transplantation or heart failure related death. In February 2015, we announced that we had received unconditional approval from the FDA to conduct an interim analysis of COUNTER HF, which could have reduced the overall duration of the trial. In March 2015, we announced that COUNTER HF had reached a pre-determined pausing point and we temporarily suspended enrollment in accordance with the study protocol. In May 2015 we announced that the FDA approved resumption of patient enrollment into the study and we began the process of reactivating clinical sites and of resuming enrollment of patients into the study. We concluded 2015 with 66 enrollments, 35 randomizations, 29 activated centers and 9 additional centers committed to participate. As we evaluated the pace of enrollment into our pivotal and post market studies, we determined that enrolling these studies would take much longer than anticipated as a result of the invasiveness of the implant procedure and requirements imposed by the trial design. As a result, on March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients into the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed below under &#147;Our Strategy.&#148;

&#160; 

We obtained CE Mark for the C-Pulse System in July 2012. In order to gain additional clinical data and support reimbursement in Europe, we initiated a 50-patient post-market study in Europe to evaluate endpoints similar to those for our U.S. pivotal study. We commenced enrollment in our OPTIONS HF study in the second quarter of 2013. We concluded 2015 with a total of 15 implants performed prior to the termination of enrollment in the OPTIONS HF study. 

&#160; 

We incurred net losses of $26.6 million, $25.6 million, and $21.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Historically, sales of the C-Pulse System to hospitals and clinics under contract in conjunction with our North American 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FDA clinical studies have generated all of our revenue. The C-Pulse System is not approved for commercial sale but the FDA has assigned it to a Category B designation, making it eligible for reimbursement at certain U.S. sites during our clinical studies. However, since certain insurance companies and government institutions have a non-coverage policy for experimental or investigational procedures, we have not been successful in achieving reimbursement for some implant procedures and have generated only limited revenue from our clinical studies. Since we have terminated enrollment in our OPTIONS HF and COUNTER HF clinical trials, we have no current source of revenue to sustain our present activities. We do not expect to generate any revenue from clinical trials during fiscal 2016 and we expect to incur significant net losses as we continue to conduct clinical studies and pursue commercialization .

&#160; 

Our Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and other developed countries. The American Heart Association estimates that 5.7 million people in the United States age 20 and over are affected by heart failure, with an estimated 670,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Nearly 30% of heart failure patients are below the age of 60, and congestive heart failure is the highest U.S. chronic health care expense category. 

&#160; 

Heart failure is a progressive disease caused by impairment of the left heart&#146;s ability to pump blood to the various organs of the body. Patients with heart failure commonly experience shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty exercising and swelling of the legs. The heart becomes weak or stiff and enlarges over time, making it harder for the left heart to pump the blood needed for the body to function properly. The severity of heart failure depends on how well a person&#146;s heart is able to pump blood throughout the body. A common measure of heart failure severity is the New York Heart Association (the &#147;NYHA&#148; ) Class guideline. Patients are classified in Classes I through IV based on their symptoms and functional limitations. Classes I and II include patients with mild heart failure, Class III includes patients with moderate heart failure, and Class IV includes patients with severe heart failure. 

&#160; 

The C-Pulse System is intended for NYHA Class III and ambulatory Class IV patients. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million heart failure patients in the United States fall into this classification range, and we believe approximately 3.7 million patients in Europe are similarly affected. 

&#160; 

Treatment alternatives currently available for Class III heart failure patients in the United States consist primarily of pharmacological therapies and cardiac pacing devices that are designed to address heart rhythm issues. Although these treatments may provide symptomatic relief and prolong the life of patients, they do not often halt the progression of congestive heart failure. One product received FDA approval in the United States for Class IIIb patients, but that device is not reimbursed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for Class IIIb patients. Circulatory assist devices, specifically left ventricular assist devices ( &#147;LVADs&#148; ) have been used to treat Class IV patients in the United States. LVADs are designed to take over some or all of the pumping function of the heart by mechanically pumping blood into the aorta. Although such products are effective in increasing blood flow, by design these devices are in contact with the patient&#146;s bloodstream, requiring the lifelong use of blood-thinning drugs and increasing the risk of severe adverse events, including thrombosis, bleeding and neurologic events such as stroke. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to become a market leader in the treatment of moderate to severe heart failure through the commercialization of the C-Pulse System and complementary technologies, and to continue the development of the system to make it more convenient for patients and physicians. We believe that our technology will provide us with a competitive advantage in the market for treating specific segments of heart failure patients. 

&#160; 

On March 3, 2016, we announced a new strategic direction. We are currently working with our investigators to develop the specifics of our revised clinical and product development strategy. Our new strategic direction includes the following two high level objectives: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; in the near term, pursuing a shorter clinical trial to generate incremental data to further demonstrate the clinical benefits of C-Pulse therapy, which will be used to support and expedite the U.S. regulatory approval of a fully implantable device. This will include making relatively minor modifications to the current C-Pulse device, as further discussed below, and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; in the longer term, focusing additional resources on accelerating development of a fully-implantable system, which we ultimately believe will benefit our business and prospects.

&#160; 

To achieve our objectives, we intend to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Assess the value of counterpulsation therapy with our current device - Based on clinical data to date, we believe the optimal benefit from the C-Pulse System can be reached in the first 6 months of therapy. For that reason, we plan to pursue a short-

&#160; 

&#160; 

term clinical study to provide further evidence of recovery or restaging and further demonstrating the benefits of the C-Pulse System becoming a &#147;short-term&#148; therapy. Prior to commencing this trial, we plan to make certain improvements to the current C-Pulse System, as further discussed below. We believe these improvements, combined with a shorter duration of the trial and therapy, which will reduce the risk of infection, will increase patient acceptance of the current C-Pulse System. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; C ontinue development of the C-Pulse System to ensure a minimally invasive approach and increase therapy acceptance in Class III heart failure patients - We believe it will be important to continue refining the C-Pulse System to make it more appealing for both patients and physicians. Since completing our 21-patient North American feasibility study, we have made several improvements to the C-Pulse System based on the feasibility study outcomes and feedback we received from surgeons and patients during the feasibility study. These changes include enhancements to our Driver, Cuff, and Percutaneous Interface Leads ( &#147;PIL&#148; ), among others. We are currently in the process of reviewing and making further improvements to our current C-Pulse System in response to feedback received from patients and physicians during the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies. Our goal is to make the implant procedure less invasive, improve reliability of the system, specifically to extend the life of the external driver and reduce the need for frequent driver replacements. We also intend to accelerate the funding for a fully implantable system which we believe will greatly increase the acceptance of the therapy. We have completed initial animal studies of a fully-implantable C-Pulse System featuring a fully implantable Pump and Cuff, which would eliminate the need for a percutaneous driveline, thus addressing the risk of infections at the skin exit sites and increasing the patient&#146;s comfort.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Investigate the potential of neuromodulation effects of counterpulsation &#151; Recently published data from our European OPTIONS HF study shows clinically meaningful improvement in mean left ventricular ejection fraction along with strong trends on improvement of functional capacity and neurohormonal levels, which leads us to believe that aortic extravascular counterpulsation has neuromodulatory effects in addition to a hemodynamic impact. We are in the early stages of evaluating the recovery capabilities of counterpulsation and have begun studies that directly measure the effect of C-Pulse on sympathetic nerve activity.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue adjacent and synergistic technologies that treat patients with Class III heart failure &#151; Our goal is to become a leader in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe heart failure. To that end, we intend to pursue applications of our technology in areas that are complementary and synergistic to our existing therapy, as well as pursuing adjacent technologies that we believe will benefit the patient population we are seeking to address.

&#160; 

Our System 

&#160; 

The C-Pulse System is based on the concept of counterpulsation applied in an extra-aortic approach to assist the left ventricle by reducing the workload required to pump blood throughout the body, while increasing blood flow to the coronary arteries. Combined, these potential benefits may help sustain the patient&#146;s current condition or, in some documented cases, reverse the heart failure process, thereby potentially preventing or delaying the need for later-stage heart failure devices, such as LVADs or artificial hearts, or for transplants. It may also provide relief from the symptoms of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure, and improve quality of life and cardiac function. Based on the results from our feasibility study, we also believe that some patients treated with the C-Pulse System may be able to stop using the device due to sustained improvement in their conditions as a result of the therapy. 

&#160; 

Once implanted, the C-Pulse Cuff is positioned around the patient&#146;s ascending aorta above the aortic valve. An electrocardiogram sensing lead is then attached to the heart to determine timing for cuff inflation and deflation in synchronization with the heartbeat. As the heart fills with blood, the C-Pulse Cuff inflates to push blood from the aorta to the rest of the body and to the heart muscle via the coronary arteries. Just before the heart pumps, the C-Pulse Cuff deflates to reduce the heart&#146;s workload through pressure changes, allowing the heart to pump with less effort. The C-Pulse Cuff and electrical leads are connected to a single line that is run through the abdominal wall to connect to a power driver outside the body. The system&#146;s single unit driver and battery source are contained inside a carrying bag. 

&#160; 

Surgeons in the feasibility phase of our clinical study initially implanted the C-Pulse System in patients via a full sternotomy and then via a mini-thoracotomy. During the feasibility study, this minimally invasive procedure was developed to allow the C-Pulse System to be implanted via a small pacemaker-like incision between the patient&#146;s ribs and sternum, rather than through a full sternotomy. The first implant using this less invasive procedure was completed in 2010. Patients implanted via a minimally invasive procedure typically require a hospital stay of four to seven days in connection with implantation of the C-Pulse System, after which they return home. This compares to an average hospital stay of 14 days for patients implanted with the C-Pulse System via a full sternotomy. Therefore, we believe that a less invasive approach can reduce procedural time, hospital stays, overall cost and patient risk as compared to treatment options that require a full sternotomy. Surgeon experience and feedback during our COUNTER HF study indicated that this minimally invasive procedure, while possible to perform, was complex. As a result, we intend to make further improvements to our surgical approach to simplify it and make it accessible to all surgeons participating in a future study. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The C-Pulse System distinguishes itself from other mechanical heart failure therapies in two important aspects, which we believe differentiate our system from other products addressing moderate to severe heart failure. First, the C-Pulse System is placed outside a patient&#146;s vascular system. The C-Pulse Cuff is placed around a patient&#146;s ascending aorta and assists the heart&#146;s normal pumping function, rather than being inserted into the vascular system and replacing heart function like other devices, such as LVADs. Because the C-Pulse System remains outside the vascular system, there is less risk of complications such as blood clots, stroke and thrombosis in comparison to other mechanical devices that reside or function inside the vascular system. Because it rests outside the vasculature, it also does not require blood thinning agents that are necessary for patients with devices that are in contact with the bloodstream. As with any implanted device with a percutaneous driver lead, patients using our system have a risk of infection from the implantation procedure or from the driver lead exit site. Any untreated sternal/mediastinal infection arising from the implantation procedure or exit site infection could result in erosion of the aortic wall or an aortic disruption. Because our system has been implanted in a limited number of patients to date, the potential competitive disadvantages and risks associated with the use of our system are not fully known at this time. 

&#160; 

Second, once implanted, the C-Pulse System does not need to be in constant operation, and patients can safely turn the device on or off at any time. This feature enables patients to disconnect from the device to perform certain activities such as showering. Patients are not required to visit a medical facility when turning our device on or off or using the device. However, to maximize the benefit from the C-Pulse System, patients are advised to turn off the system only for short periods of time and for specified activities. If the C-Pulse System is not used as directed, patients might experience a return of their heart failure symptoms, a loss of any improvement in their condition resulting from use of our system or an overall worsening of their heart failure symptoms compared to when they began using our system. 

&#160; 

Clinical Development 

&#160; 

Our North American feasibility clinical study was primarily designed to assess safety and provide indications of performance of the C-Pulse System in moderate to severe heart failure patients who suffer from symptoms such as shortness of breath and reduced mobility. In the first half of 2011, we completed enrollment and implantation of 20 patients in the study and received FDA approval of an expansion protocol to allow us to implant additional patients and add two centers to our feasibility study, which enabled expansion of the cohort to 21 patients. We do not have plans to implant any additional patients in our North American feasibility study at this time. 

&#160; 

In November 2011, we announced the preliminary results of the six-month follow-up period for the feasibility study and we submitted the clinical data to the FDA. The table below summarizes updated results from the six-month follow-up data as well as the 12-month data, which became available in June 2012. In July 2012, we also completed a two-year follow-up for a patient implanted with our system.

&#160; 

We believe the six-month and 12-month follow-up results demonstrate the feasibility of the C-Pulse System implantation procedure and provide indications of safety and efficacy of the C-Pulse System in patients with moderate to severe heart failure and submitted the data to the FDA. In March 2012, the FDA notified us that it had completed its review of the C-Pulse System feasibility study data and concluded we met the applicable agency requirements, and further indicated that we could move forward with an IDE application. 

&#160; 

In November 2012, the FDA provided us with approval to initiate a pivotal study. The COUNTER HF study was designed to enroll 388 patients randomized 1:1 to treatment (C-Pulse implantation) versus optimal medical therapy, at up to 40 participating hospitals and clinics. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was defined as freedom from worsening heart failure resulting in hospitalization, LVAD implantation, cardiac transplantation or heart failure related death. We commenced enrollment of the COUNTER HF pivotal study in the third quarter of 2013. In February 2015, we announced that we had received unconditional approval from the FDA to conduct an interim analysis of COUNTER HF, which could have reduced the overall duration of the trial. In March 2015, we announced that COUNTER HF had reached a pre-determined pausing point and we temporarily suspended enrollment in accordance with the study protocol. In May 2015, we announced that the FDA had approved resumption of patient enrollment in the study, and we began the process of reactivating clinical sites and of resuming patient enrollment into the study. As we evaluated the pace of enrollment into our pivotal and post market studies, we determined that enrolling these studies would take much longer than anticipated as a result of the invasiveness of the implant procedure and requirements imposed by the trial design. As a result, on March 3, 2016 we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients into the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed above under &#147;Our Strategy.&#148; 

&#160; 

We intend to initiate discussions with the FDA on a revised clinical study protocol for a new study in which patients will remain on therapy for a shorter duration. We believe the optimal benefit from the C-Pulse System can be reached in the first 6 months of therapy, and we plan to seek approval for a trial design that reflects this belief. 

&#160; 

We recently published (Schultz et al. Med. Sci. Monit Basic Res, 2016;22) interim data from the OPTIONS HF post market study demonstrating significant and clinically meaningful improvement in ejection fraction from 24.3&#177;7.9% at baseline to 44.5&#177;4.5% at 6 months (p&#60;0.0001). One patient was also weaned from device. A more complete analysis from OPTIONS HF has been accepted for presentation at the ESC Heart Failure Association meeting in Florence on May 21, 2016. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development expense totaled $17.7 million, $16.9 million and $13.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research and development costs include activities related to research, development, design, testing and manufacturing of prototypes of our system as well as costs associated with certain clinical and regulatory activities. 

&#160; 

Since completing our 21-patient North American feasibility study, we have made several improvements to the C-Pulse System based on the patient outcomes and feedback we received from surgeons and patients during the study. 

&#160; 

We have completed initial animal studies of a next generation C-Pulse system, featuring a fully implantable Pump and Cuff, which would eliminate the need for a percutaneous driveline, thus reducing the risk of infection and increasing the patient&#146;s comfort. While we continue to assess the commercial application of our current C-Pulse System, we believe development of a next-generation, fully implantable system would benefit our business and prospects. 

&#160; 

As we evaluated the pace of enrollment into our pivotal and post market studies, we determined that enrolling these studies would take much longer than anticipated as a result of the invasiveness of the implant procedure and requirements imposed by the trial design. As a result, on March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients in the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies, and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed above under &#147;Our Strategy&#148;. Our revised strategy includes (1) making improvements to the current C-Pulse System based on physician and patient feedback and modifying our current surgical approach to make the implant procedure less invasive, both of which we believe will enhance patient acceptance of our therapy and (2) immediately focusing additional resources on our longer-term goal of accelerating development of a fully-implantable system. 

&#160; 

While we have stopped enrolling patients in our clinical studies and have been and continue to be focused on reducing our operating expenses in the near term, we expect our future research and development expenses to increase as we conduct further clinical studies and focus on the development of our fully-implantable system. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

To date, all of our sales of the C-Pulse System have been to U.S. hospitals and clinics who participate in our clinical studies per the terms of the clinical study contracts. We have solicited hospitals and clinics for our studies through our employees, who select hospitals and clinics for participation based on an assessment of their expertise in the area of moderate and severe heart failure and their understanding of our system. We completed enrollment in our North American feasibility clinical study in the first half of 2011 and we did not generate any revenue from sales of our system during 2012 and through the first half of 2013. We commenced enrollment in our pivotal clinical study in the third quarter of 2013. 

&#160; 

We obtained CE Mark in July 2012. In the second quarter of 2013, we initiated enrollment in a 50-patient post-market study of our system in Europe. We retained consultants to analyze the conditions in various European countries for potential reimbursement for our system and the capabilities of existing hospitals and clinics to implant the C-Pulse System properly and understand the potential benefits of our system. We initially planned to sell our system in Germany, the UK and Austria, which we believed to be the largest potential European markets for our system and have supported reimbursement for heart failure technologies in the past. We have not obtained approval for reimbursement in any European country although we have received an NUB status 4 in Germany, making our device eligible for reimbursement on a case by case basis. The timing for full commercial release into European and other markets where we could leverage the existing CE Mark is uncertain and will depend on, among other factors, the success of our initial sales efforts in Europe, the results of our clinical studies, and the other factors described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

As we evaluated the pace of enrollment into our pivotal and post market studies, we determined that enrolling these studies would take much longer than anticipated as a result of the invasiveness of the implant procedure and requirements imposed by the trial design. As a result, on March 3, 2016, we announced that we are no longer enrolling patients in the COUNTER HF and OPTIONS HF studies, and that we plan to pursue a new strategic direction, as discussed above under &#147;Our Strategy&#148;. Since we have terminated enrollment in our OPTIONS HF and COUNTER HF clinical trials, we do not expect any revenue from the C-Pulse System during fiscal 2016.

&#160; 

Manufacturers and Suppliers 

&#160; 

The C-Pulse System has been implanted only in connection with clinical studies. We outsource most of the manufacturing of our system to suppliers with our activities primarily directed toward supply chain management and distribution of our system to clinics and hospitals. A number of critical components of the C-Pulse System, including the balloon, driver unit and interface lead are provided by outside suppliers and tested by us in-house. Our suppliers include large and small U.S.-based and international manufacturers of medical device components. In 2013, we moved the assembly of the balloon and cuff, along with the related marking and packaging operations, to our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facility. These processes occur under a clean room environment. Our quality system complies with the latest requirements of ISO 13485:2003, EN ISO 13485:2012, Active Medical Device Directive (AIMD) 90/385/EEC and the US FDA Quality Systems Regulations 21 CFR Part 820. 

&#160; 

The components for our system do not require significant customization for use in our system or necessitate any raw materials for which we believe our suppliers could not readily find alternative sources. We purchase from our suppliers primarily on a purchase order basis. We do not &#147;second source&#148; any components of our system, although we believe we could find alternative suppliers for each component of our system, other than the balloon, without materially interrupting production of our system at current levels. If the manufacturer of the balloon used in our system was unwilling or unable to supply this component for any reason, however, our business could be adversely affected. If we obtain regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize the C-Pulse System, all of our outsourced manufacturers would need to increase their production of our system or we would need to develop capabilities to manufacture the system ourselves. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have established an intellectual property portfolio through which we seek to protect our system and technology. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of over 75 issued patents in the United States and abroad. We also had more than 35 patent applications pending as of that date. Our patents and patent applications cover various aspects of both the methodology as well as the design of the C-Pulse System device and related components. 

&#160; 

We have developed technical knowledge that, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with each of our employees and consultants prohibiting the disclosure of any confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, these agreements provide that any inventions or discoveries by employees and consultants relating to our business will be assigned to us and become our sole property. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Despite our patent rights and policies with regard to confidential information, trade secrets and inventions, we may be subject to challenges to the validity of our patents, claims that our system infringes the patent rights of others and the disclosure of our confidential information or trade secrets. These and other risks are described more fully under the heading &#147;Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property&#148; in the &#147;Risk Factors&#148; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

At this time we are not a party to any material legal proceedings that relate to patents or proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and expected to increase. The vast majority of Class III and Class IV heart failure patients still receive pharmacological treatment and a smaller percentage are treated with LVADs and other medical devices. We are not aware of any direct competitors that offer devices residing outside the vascular system for treatment of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure, and therefore we continue to expect new competitors both from the pharmacological and the medical device space. Among the other medical device competitors that treat or may treat Class III or ambulatory Class IV heart failure patients are Berlin Heart GmbH, HeartWare International Inc., Jarvik Heart, Inc., ReliantHeart, Inc., and St. Jude Medical Corporation, as well as a range of other specialized medical device companies with devices at varying stages of development. Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our Company and our system from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; financial resources;

&#183; &#160; product performance and design;

&#183; &#160; risk management;

&#183; &#160; product safety;

&#183; &#160; acceptance of our system in the marketplace;

&#183; &#160; sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;

&#183; &#160; manufacturing and assembly costs;

&#183; &#160; pricing of our system and of our competitors&#146; products;

&#183; &#160; the availability of reimbursement from government and private health insurers;

&#183; &#160; success and timing of new product development and introductions;

&#183; &#160; regulatory approvals; and

&#183; &#160; intellectual property protection.

&#160; 

We believe the C-Pulse System&#146;s lower risk profile, resulting from its position outside a patient&#146;s vascular system, the ability to temporarily disconnect the C-Pulse System without harm to the patient, and the less invasive manner in which the C-Pulse System can be implanted, will help our system effectively compete in the markets where it is approved for sale. 

&#160; 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

&#160; 

If approved in the United States, we expect the C-Pulse System to be purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals, who then would bill various third-party payers for the services provided to the patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies and managed care organizations, would then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed. 

&#160; 

The agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and a majority of private insurers have approved reimbursement for the C-Pulse System in clinical studies. The FDA has assigned the C-Pulse System to a Category B3 designation under IDE number G120201. By assigning the C-Pulse System a Category B3 designation, the FDA determined that the C-Pulse System is non-experimental/investigational. A non-experimental/investigational device refers to a device believed to be in Class I or Class II, or a device believed to be in Class III for which the incremental risk is the primary risk in question (that is, underlying questions of safety and effectiveness of that device type have been resolved), or it is known that the device type can be safe and effective because, for example, other manufacturers have obtained FDA approval for that device type. 

&#160; 

With an IDE number assigned based on our Category B3 designation, providers are allowed to seek coverage and reimbursement for the C-Pulse System under the Medicare program from their Medicare fiscal intermediary for hospital services, carrier for physician services or Medicare Administrative Contractor for both services. There can be no assurance, however, that fiscal intermediaries or Medicare Administrative Contractors will make payment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are analyzing the potential for third-party reimbursement in various European countries. Third-party reimbursement requirements vary from country to country in Europe and we are not approved for reimbursement in any European country at this time. Health care laws in the United States and other countries are subject to ongoing changes, including changes to the amount of reimbursement for hospital services. Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. Also, from time to time there are a number of legislative, regulatory and other proposals both at the federal and state levels; it remains uncertain whether there will be any future changes that will be proposed or finalized and what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations would have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our current system and any future products and in our ongoing research and development activities. All of our proposed products will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization. In particular, medical devices are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing as a condition of approval by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates the design, manufacture, distribution and promotion of medical devices pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its regulations. The C-Pulse System is regulated as a medical device. To obtain FDA approval to market the C-Pulse System, the FDA requires proof of safety and efficacy in human clinical studies performed under an IDE. An IDE application must contain pre-clinical test data supporting the safety of the product for human investigational use, information on manufacturing processes and procedures, proposed clinical protocols and other information. If the IDE application is approved, human clinical studies may begin. The results obtained from clinical studies are then submitted to the FDA in support of a premarket approval ( &#147;PMA&#148; ) application. 

&#160; 

Clinical studies are subject to registration on a government-approved internet site and are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical studies must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board ( &#147;IRB &#148;) for the relevant clinical study sites and they must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical study, we are also required to obtain the patients&#146; informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. 

&#160; 

During clinical studies products must be manufactured in accordance with the practices expected by the FDA under the IDE. Design of the products must be done under the Quality System Regulation (the &#147;QSR&#148; ). Once approved by the FDA, the products must be manufactured in registered establishments and must be manufactured in accordance with the QSR. Furthermore, the FDA may at any time inspect our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers to determine whether we or our suppliers comply with FDA regulations, including the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process. 

&#160; 

Once commercialized, we will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports (MDRs) on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by FDA. 

&#160; 

We and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers&#146; facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations. Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

Health Care Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to extensive federal and state government regulation. This includes the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state anti-kickback laws, the federal False Claims Act and similar state false claims laws, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( &#147;HIPAA&#148; ), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the &#147;HITECH Act&#148; ), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, and similar state laws addressing privacy and security. Although we believe that our operations materially comply with the laws governing our industry, it is possible that non-compliance with existing laws or the adoption of new laws or interpretations of existing laws could adversely affect our financial performance. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160; 

The health care industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act revises the evidentiary standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and eliminates the requirement of actual knowledge, or specific intent, to commit a violation of the statute. This amendment to the Anti-Kickback Statute may improve the government&#146;s ability to meet its evidentiary burden for establishing liability. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions, including fines, imprisonment and possible administrative action for suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and it prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations in July of 1991, which the Department has referred to as &#147;safe harbors.&#148; These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Our arrangements with physicians, physician practice groups, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in positions to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny or enforcement actions by government enforcement authorities such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. 

&#160; 

Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source, not only federal health care programs. Although we believe that we comply with both federal and state anti-kickback laws, any finding of a violation of these laws could subject us to criminal and civil and administrative penalties or possible administrative action for suspension or exclusion from federal or state health care programs. Such penalties would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business. 

&#160; 

HIPAA created a new federal statute to prevent health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment or administrative action for suspension or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. Both federal and state government agencies are continuing heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As part of announced enforcement agency work plans, the federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the billing practices of hospitals and other providers of health care services. The federal government also has increased funding to fight health care fraud, and it is coordinating its enforcement efforts among various agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General and state Medicaid fraud control units. We believe that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increased government scrutiny and investigations. 

&#160; 

Federal False Claims Act 

&#160; 

Another trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the False Claims Act&#146;s &#147;relator&#148; or &#147;whistleblower&#148; provisions. Those provisions allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. After the individual has initiated the lawsuit, the government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and become the primary prosecutor. If the government declines to join the lawsuit, then the individual may choose to pursue the case alone, in which case the individual&#146;s counsel will have primary control over the prosecution, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. If the litigation is successful, the individual is entitled to no less than 15%, but no more than 30%, of whatever amount the government recovers. The percentage of the individual&#146;s recovery varies, depending on whether the government intervened in the case and other factors. Recently, the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, most states have enacted or are considering enacting laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, states are being encouraged to adopt false claims acts similar to the federal False Claims Act, which establish liability for submission of fraudulent claims to the state Medicaid programs and contain whistleblower provisions. Even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no judgment or settlement, we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation. Future actions under the False Claims Act 

&#160; 

&#160; 

may result in significant fines and legal fees, which would adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to operate our business. 

&#160; 

Further, the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expands the types of entities and conduct subject to the False Claims Act. We strive to ensure that we meet applicable regulatory requirements and guidance. However, the costs of defending claims under the False Claims Act, as well as sanctions imposed under the Act, could significantly adversely affect our financial performance. 

&#160; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 

&#160; 

In addition to creating the new federal statutes discussed above, HIPAA also establishes uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses. 

&#160; 

The HITECH Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, signed into law on February 17, 2009, dramatically expanded, among other things, (i) the scope of HIPAA to also include &#147;business associates,&#148; or independent contractors who receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service to the covered entity, (ii) substantive security and privacy obligations, including new federal security breach notification requirements to affected individuals and Department of Health and Human Services and potentially media outlets, (iii) restrictions on marketing communications and a prohibition on covered entities or business associates from receiving remuneration in exchange for protected health information and (iv) the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for HIPAA violations, increasing the annual cap in penalties from $25,000 to $1.5 million per year. We believe we are neither a HIPAA-defined &#147;covered entity&#148; nor a &#147;business associate,&#148; and therefore are not presently subject to HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security standards. It is possible that future changes in our operations or the law could subject us to HIPAA&#146;s privacy and security requirements and penalty provisions if we failed to comply. In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws, which may entail significant and costly changes for us. We believe that we are in compliance with such state laws and regulations. However, if we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. 

&#160; 

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 

&#160; 

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and alternative payment models, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. Our strategic initiatives include measures to address this trend; however, there can be no assurance that any of our strategic measures will successfully address this trend. 

&#160; 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Affordable Care Act&#148; ) were enacted into law in the United States in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company that expects significant future sales in the United States once the C-Pulse System is approved for sale, this health care reform law will materially impact us. Certain provisions of the law just recently became, or are not yet effective, and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law&#146;s mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance but rejected specific provisions that would have penalized states that did not expand their current Medicaid programs. As a result of this ruling and other factors, we expect implementation of most of the major provisions of the law to continue, some of which (e.g., comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies) could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements, reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or other participants in the health care industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Sunshine Act 

&#160; 

The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid starting in 2012 to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Implementing regulations have required us to collect this data beginning in August 2013 for reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2014 for subsequent public disclosure. Manufacturers must also 

&#160; 

&#160; 

disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Violations of these laws may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. 

&#160; 

International Regulations 

&#160; 

We are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries where we intend to conduct clinical research and distribute the C-Pulse System. These regulations relate to product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties, tax requirements, and anti-bribery prohibitions. Many of the regulations applicable to our system in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The national health or social security organizations of certain countries require our system to be qualified before it can be marketed in those countries. 

&#160; 

The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Union, which consists of 28 member states. The European Union has adopted two directives that cover medical devices&#151;Directive 93/42/EEC covering medical devices and Directive 90/385/EEC for active implantable medical devices&#151;as well as numerous standards that govern and harmonize the national laws and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical studies, labeling, adverse event reporting and post-market surveillance activities for medical devices that are marketed in member states. The EU Commission is in the process of revising the Directives and we may face more strenuous requirements in the EU in the future. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of the national law of the member state in which they are first marketed will be entitled to bear CE Marking, indicating that the device conforms to applicable regulatory requirements, and, accordingly, can be commercially marketed within European Union states and other countries that recognize this mark for regulatory purposes. We obtained CE Marking for the C-Pulse System in July 2012. 

&#160; 

The regulatory agency in Canada is Health Canada. Medical Devices are governed under the Health Products and Food Branch in the office of the Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD). The Medical Device regulation is SOR-98-282 which governs clinical studies. We are currently in the process of closing the investigational study at one clinical site in Canada. 

&#160; 

Anti-Corruption/Anti-Bribery Laws 

&#160; 

We are subject to the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#147;FCPA&#148; ) and other countries&#146; anti-corruption/anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our biomaterials is subject to compliance with federal environmental regulations and by various state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws or regulations in the future. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 38 employees, consisting of 37 full-time and 1 part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Corporate Information 

&#160; 

Sunshine Heart, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on August 22, 2002. We began operating our business in November 1999 through Sunshine Heart Company Pty Limited, which currently is a wholly owned Australian subsidiary of Sunshine Heart, Inc. In September of 2004, Chess Depositary Instruments (&#147;CDIs&#148;) representing beneficial ownership of our common stock began trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (the &#147;ASX&#148;) under the symbol &#147;SHC.&#148; Initially, each CDI represented one share of our common stock. In connection with the 1-for-200 reverse stock split we affected on January 27, 2012, we changed this ratio so that each CDI represented 1/200th of a share of our common stock. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2011, we filed a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, which was declared effective on February 14, 2012. The Form 10 registered our common stock under the Exchange Act. Our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) on February 16, 2012. 

&#160; 

On February 5, 2013, we received conditional approval from the ASX to delist from the official list of the ASX. The delisting occurred at the close of trading on May 6, 2013. 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 12988 Valley View Road, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344, and our telephone number is (952) 345-4200. Our website address is www.sunshineheart.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, going forward, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be made available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into and should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to U.S. public companies. These provisions include an exemption from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors pursuant to section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The provisions of the JOBS Act do not preclude us from the requirement to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 

&#160; 

We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years following our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced requirements. In addition, the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to U.S. public companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting standards for U.S. public companies. 

&#160;
