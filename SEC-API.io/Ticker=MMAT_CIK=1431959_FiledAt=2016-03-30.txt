 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Corporate History and Background 

Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. was incorporated in October 2007 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Pole Perfect Studios, Inc. (&#8220;PPS&#8221;). 

&#160;

On November 23, 2010, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) between the major shareholders of PPS and the shareholders of Torchlight Energy, Inc. (&#8220;TEI&#8221;). As a result of the transactions effected by the Exchange Agreement, at closing TEI became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the business of TEI became our sole business. TEI is an energy company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in June 2010. We are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, and/or development of oil and natural gas properties in the United States. In addition to TEI, we also operate our business through two other wholly-owned subsidiaries, Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and Hudspeth Oil Corporation, a Texas corporation. 

&#160;

On December 10, 2010, we effected a 4-for-1 forward split of our shares of common stock outstanding. All owners of record at the close of business on December 10, 2010 (record date) received three additional shares for every one share they owned. All share amounts reflected throughout this report take into account the 4-for-1 forward split. 

Effective February 8, 2011, we changed our name to &#8220;Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.&#8221; In connection with the name change, our ticker symbol changed from &#8220;PPFT&#8221; to &#8220;TRCH.&#8221; 

Business Overview 

Our business model is to focus on drilling and working interest programs within the United States that have a short window of payback, a high internal rate of return, and proven and bookable reserves. We have interests in four oil and gas projects, which projects are described in more detail below in the section titled &#8220;Current Projects.&#8221; We anticipate being involved in multiple other oil and gas projects moving forward, pending adequate funding. We anticipate acquiring exploration and development projects both as a non-operating working interest partner, participating in drilling activities primarily on a basis proportionate to the working interest, and acquiring properties we can operate. We intend to spread the risk associated with drilling programs by entering into a variety of programs in different fields with differing economics. 

Salient characteristics of the company include our industry relationships, leverage for prospect selection, anticipated diversity, both geologically and geographically, cost control, partnering, and protection of capital exposure. Management believes opportunities exist to identify and pursue relatively low risk projects at very attractive entry prices. These projects may be available from small operators in financial distress, larger companies that need to share costs, and large producers who are consolidating their activities in other areas. Management believes attractive entry prices and tight cost control will result in returns that are superior to those achieved by major companies or small independents. An integral part of this strategy is the partnering of major activities. Such partnering will enable us to acquire the talents of proven industry veterans, as needed, without affecting our long-term fixed overhead costs. 

Key Business Attributes 

Experienced People . We build on the expertise and experiences of our management team, including John Brda, Willard McAndrew, and Roger Wurtele. We will also receive guidance from outside advisors as well as our Board of Directors and will align with high quality exploration and technical partners. 

Project Focus . We are focusing primarily on low risk exploitation projects by pursuing resources where commercial production has already been established but where opportunity for additional and nearby development is indicated. 

Lower Cost Structure . We will attempt to maintain the lowest possible cost structure, enabling the greatest margins and providing opportunities for investment that would not be feasible for higher cost competitors for lower-risk, valuable projects. 

Limit Capital Risks . Limited capital exposure is planned initially to add value to a project and determine its economic viability. Projects are staged and have options before additional capital is invested. We will limit our exposure in any one project by participating at reduced working interest levels, thereby being able to diversify with limited capital. Management has experience in successfully managing risks of projects, finance, and value. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

Project Focus 

Generally, we will focus on lower risk exploitation projects (primarily for oil, although gas projects will be considered if the economics are favorable). Projects are first identified, evaluated, and followed by the engagement of third party operating or financial partners. Subject to overall availability of capital, our interest in large capital projects will be limited. Each opportunity will be investigated on a standalone basis for both technical and financial merit. High risk exploration prospects are less favored than low risk exploitation. We will, however, consider high risk-high reward exploration in connection with exploitation opportunities in a project that would reduce the overall project economic risk. We will consider such projects on their individual merits, and we expect them to be a minor part of our overall portfolio. 

We will be actively seeking quality new investment opportunities to sustain our growth, and we believe we will have access to many new projects. The sources of these opportunities will vary but all will be evaluated with the same criteria of technical and economic factors. With a focus on development rather than higher risk exploration projects, it is expected that projects will come from the many small producers who find themselves under-funded or over-extended and therefore vulnerable to price volatility. The financial ability to respond quickly to opportunities will ensure a continuous stream of projects and will enable us to negotiate from a stronger position to enhance value. 

With emphasis on acquisitions and development strategies, the types of projects in which we will be involved vary from increased production due to simple re-engineering of existing wellbores to step-out drilling, drilling horizontally, and extensions of known fields. Recompletion of existing wellbores in new zones, development of deeper zones and detailing of structure, and stratigraphic traps with three-dimensional seismic and utilization of new technologies will all be part of our anticipated program. Our preferred type of projects are in-fills to existing production with nearly immediate cash flow and/or adjacent or on trend to existing production. We will prefer projects with moderate to low risk, unrecognized upside potential, and geographic diversity. 

Business Processes 

We believe there are three principal business processes that we must follow to enable our operations to be profitable. Each major business process offers the opportunity for a distinct partner or alliance as we grow. These processes are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Investment Evaluation and Review; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Operations and Field Activities; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Administrative and Finance Management. 

Investment Evaluation and Review . This process is the key ingredient to our success. Recognition of quality investment opportunities is the fuel that drives our engine. Broadly, this process includes the following activities: prospect acquisition, regional and local geological and geophysical evaluations, data processing, economic analysis, lease acquisition and negotiations, permitting, and field supervision. We expect these evaluation processes to be managed by our management team. Expert or specific technical support will be outsourced as needed. Only if a project is taken to development, and only then, will additional staff be hired. New personnel will have very specific responsibilities. We anticipate attractive investment opportunities to be presented from outside companies and from the large informal community of geoscientists and engineers. Building a network of advisors is key to the pipeline of high quality opportunities. 

Operations and Field Activities . This process will begin following management approval of an investment. Well site supervision, construction, drilling, logging, product marketing, and transportation are examples of some activities. The present plan is that we will prefer to be the operator, but when operations are not possible, we will farm-out sufficient interests to third parties that will be responsible for these operating activities. We will provide personnel to monitor these activities and associated costs. 

Administrative and Finance Management . This process will coordinate our initial structuring and capitalization, general operations and accounting, reporting, audit, banking and cash management, regulatory agencies reporting and interaction, timely and accurate payment of royalties, taxes, leases rentals, vendor accounts and performance management that includes budgeting and maintenance of financial controls, and interface with legal counsel and tax and other financial and business advisors. 

Current Projects 

As of December 31, 2015 the Company had interests in four oil and gas projects: the Marcelina Creek Field Development in Wilson County, Texas, the Ring Energy Joint Venture in Southwest Kansas, Hunton wells in partnership with Husky Ventures in Central Oklahoma and the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

Marcelina Creek Field Development . 

On July 6, 2010, TEI entered into a participation agreement with Bayshore Operating Corporation, LLC (&#8220;Bayshore&#8221;), which is currently the holder of an oil, gas, and mineral lease covering approximately 1,045 acres in Wilson County, Texas, known as the Marcelina Creek Field Development. The Participation Agreement provides for the drilling of four wells. Three of the obligation wells have been drilled. The first three wells include a horizontal re-entry well known as the Johnson-1-H, a vertical well known as the Johnson #4, and a lateral well known as the Johnson #2-H. These three wells are presently producing a total of approximately 80 BOPD as of December 31, 2015. The remaining well (Johnson #3) is to be a vertical development well at a location to be determined within the existing lease. Drilling is anticipated for midyear 2016. 

The Company initiated a reentry project on the Johnson #4 well early in 2016 which has been completed. Initial production at completion was 2,920 barrels for the month of February. Production has declined to approximately 90 barrels per day. However additional work is underway which is expected to substantially restore the rate of production. 

Additionally, work is being done on the Johnson #2 applying an acid treatment to increase production. This well is expected to be back in production near the beginning of second quarter, 2016. 

The Marcelina Creek Field Development is located over the Austin Chalk, Buda, and Eagle Ford Formations, which formations are well known and established producers in central Texas. Their production is controlled by vertical fracturing of the rock with high productivity in wells which encounter the greatest amount of fractures. With the advent of horizontal drilling technology, numerous opportunities exist in areas and fields that were only drilled vertically. 

The Ring Energy Joint Venture, Southwest Kansas 

In October 2013, we entered into a Joint Venture agreement with Ring Energy. The agreement called for us to provide for $6.2 million in drilling capital to, in effect, match Ring Energy&#8217;s expenditures for leasing. In exchange for this commitment, we would receive a 50% interest in each well bore drilled and the acreage unit it held, until we had spent $6.2 million. At such time, we would then receive a 50% Working Interest in the entire lease block consisting of 17,000 +/- acres. We were to provide $3.1 million in advance of the program commencing, which would cover approximately 5 wells to be drilled and completed. Once the initial five wells are completed, we and Ring would evaluate the program and the drilling activity and determine if another five wells are to be drilled. Should we continue with the program, we would then deposit another $3.1 million with Ring for drilling and completion of the next five wells. 

We have made the initial $3.1 million deposit and the first five well drilling program is completed. Drilling operations commenced in March, 2014. Seven wells have been drilled &#8211; three are producing, one can be converted to a salt water disposal well, one was not completed, and two were plugged and abandoned. Based upon results from drilling, the participants elected to suspend further drilling and obtain seismic data to guide continuing development. The seismic data has been analyzed at the date of this filing and discussions with potential parties to further develop the property are in process. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had invested approximately $5,500,000 in the Ring Joint Venture. The company believes this project is still considered to be in the testing phase. 

Hunton Play, Central Oklahoma 

&#160;

The initial Hunton acquisition included three Hunton wells, the Hancock, Robinson and Lenhart. The Hancock and Robinson are producing wells but have small working interests of 1% and .25 of 1%, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Lenhart well was a 62% working interest and was planned for recompletion to return to production. 

&#160; 

We identified a shallow sandstone that could potentially be productive and tested this formation, and although there were hydrocarbons present, they are not in sufficient quantities to be economic. The Lenhart property was sold for $25,000 and buyer&#8217;s assumption of plugging liability in 2015. 

&#160; 

During the second quarter of 2013, Torchlight entered into an agreement with Husky Ventures to participate in the drilling of wells to the Hunton Formation in central Oklahoma. We continued to expand this relationship with Husky Ventures on a monthly basis as we expand our lease acreage in the contracted Areas of Mutual Interest (AMI&#8217;s). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

&#160;

When Torchlight executed the agreement Husky had already drilled and completed 18 successful wells in the Hunton. We estimated that Husky had spent, or caused to be spent, $125 million in what we considered a Research and Development project. The results of Husky&#8217;s initial program lead them to develop certain drilling and completions techniques of which we could participate in and take advantage of. 

&#160; 

The terms in our agreement with Husky are that we pay our proportionate costs of leases and operating expenses based on our working interest. For leasing and drilling costs (the AFE), we carry Husky for 15% based on our working interest participation. This is to compensate Husky for the initial program mentioned above and, additionally, the project coordination of the geological, leasing, legal and title opinions, survey and permitting, all drilling, frac design, completion and equipping, day to day operations, and accounting and filing all required monthly and annual reporting to all governmental agencies. 

Torchlight believes this is an equitable agreement in that we have the benefit of the initial programs results while participating with a proven operator in areas that continue to provide us with outstanding results in a safe investment environment. 

Management has announced that they are seeking to divest certain of our Hunton assets located in Logan and Kingfisher Counties, Oklahoma. The Company is actively marketing these assets to potential buyers. These assets include lease rights and current production. As of March 30, 2016 negotiations and documentation of the sale of the Company&#8217;s Cimarron assets in Oklahoma is nearing completion. 

Cimarron AMI 

&#160; 

Specifically, we were able to negotiate a 15% working interest in approximately 3,700 acres in the Cimarron Area of Logan County in May 2013. Leasing continued monthly which resulted in the total acreage in which the Company has an interest increasing to 5,200 as of December 31, 2015 (Net undeveloped acres = 160). Detail of developed and undeveloped acreage positions at December 31, 2015, Drilling Activity, and Cumulative Well Status are presented in Tables in Item 2 of this filing. Our net cumulative investment through December 31, 2015 in undeveloped acres in the Cimarron AMI was $759,724. 

Chisholm Trail AMI 

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2013, we acquired from a third party for stock, a 15.3% working interest in 5011+/- acres in the Chisolm Trail AMI with Husky Ventures Inc. as the operator. Leasing also continued monthly in this AMI increasing the total acreage in which the Company had an interest. 

The Chisholm Trail properties were sold to Husky Ventures during fourth quarter, 2015 who then combined them with the Husky interests in Chisholm Trail and entered into a sale agreement with Gastar Exploration Inc. for the combined Torchlight and Husky interests. The estimated final sale price to Torchlight pending final review by Gastar of lease classification, is $4,150,000. Sale proceeds were applied to reduce Torchlight&#8217;s Joint Interest payable to Husky of $2,830,161 with the balance to be received in cash. The Company received $900,000 in cash and has recorded an account receivable as of December 31, 2015 of $419,839. Receipt of the balance of the sale proceeds was subject to final determination of lease classification and was to occur by February 28, 2016. &#160; Proceeds have not been received at date of this filing. 

Viking AMI 

&#160; 

In the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into our third Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) with Husky Ventures, the Viking Prospect. This AMI covers four townships in size. We acquired a 25% interest in 3,945 acres in the Viking. We subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. Leasing is continuing monthly so that we had an interest in 8,800 total acres in which the Company has an interest as of December 31, 2015. (Net undeveloped acres = 2,600) Husky drilled the first two wells in the AMI in second quarter, 2014. Detail of developed and undeveloped acreage positions at December 31, 2014, Drilling activity, and Cumulative Well Status are presented in Tables in Item 2 of this filing. Our net cumulative investment through December 31, 2015 in undeveloped acres in the Viking AMI was $1,389,846. 

R4 AMI 

In January of 2014, we again elected to continue to expand in the Hunton Play with Husky Ventures. We contracted for a 25% Working Interest in approximately 5,000 acres in the R4 AMI consisting of eight townships in South Central Oklahoma. We subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014. Leasing is continuing monthly so that the Company had an interest in 11,600 total acres as of December 31, 2015 (Net undeveloped acres = 3,500). Detail of developed and undeveloped acreage positions at December 31, 2015 is presented in the Table in Item 2 of this filing. Our cumulative investment through December 31, 2015 in the R4 AMI was $2,834,514. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

&#160;

Prairie Grove &#8211; Judy Well 

In February of 2014, we acquired a 10% Working Interest in a well in the Prairie Grove AMI from a non-consenting third party who elected not to participate in the well. 

T4 AMI 

In July of 2014, we elected to further expand in the Hunton Play with Husky Ventures. We contracted for a 25% Working Interest in the T4 AMI. There is an active ongoing leasing program in this AMI so that the total acres in which the Company has an interest at December 31, 2015 totals 4,300 acres (Net undeveloped acres = 1,100). Detail of developed and undeveloped acreage positions at December 31, 2015 is presented in the Table in Item 2 of this filing. Our cumulative investment through December 31, 2015 in the T4 AMI was $949,530. 

As of December 31, 2015, we are actively producing from ten wells in Cimarron, one in Viking, and one in Prairie Grove. 

&#160; 

Salt Water Disposal Facility 

The initial acquisition also included a 22.5% net royalty on a salt water disposal facility in Seminole, Oklahoma. No value was placed on the facility due to operational uncertainty. The facility which was newly commissioned in January 2013 as a state of the art disposal facility which could handle 20,000 barrels of produced and injected fluids per day. Oil and gas wells produce large quantities of saltwater that must be trucked and disposed of at a cost to the producer This SWD facility was considered non-core and was sold on April 1, 2015 for $300,000. 

&#160;

Orogrande Project, West Texas 

On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation (&#8220;Hudspeth&#8221;), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;MPC&#8221;), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was the sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the Orogrande Basin in West Texas. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that carry additional five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we issued 868,750 shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a total of $100,000 in geologic origination fees to third parties. Additionally, Mr. McCabe will have an optional 10% working interest back-in after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and conditions of a participation and development agreement. Closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on September 23, 2014. 

&#160; 

Of the 172,000 acres, 40,154 were scheduled for renewal in December, 2014. The Company renewed the leases for the 40,154 acres during second quarter, 2015. Prior to March 31, 2015, the Company had the obligation to begin drilling its first well in order to hold the acreage block. The well was permitted and spudded and drilling began by March 31, 2015. 

The Company finalized an agreement to sell a 5% working interest in the Orogrande acreage on June 30, 2015 with an effective date of April 1, 2015. Sale proceeds were $500,000 which were received in April, 2015. In addition, the Company issued 250,000 three year warrants with an exercise price of $.50 to the purchaser. 

On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation (&#8220;HOC&#8221;), entered into a Farmout Agreement by and between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP (&#8220;Pandora&#8221;), Founders Oil &#38; Gas, LLC (&#8220;Founders&#8221;), McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes) for the entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas. The Farmout Agreement provides for Founders to earn from HOC and Pandora (collectively, the &#8220;Farmor&#8221;) an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by Founder&#8217;s spending a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the next two years. Founders is to pay Farmor a total cost reimbursement of $5,000,000 in multiple installments as follows: (1) $1,000,000 at the signing of the Farmout Agreement, the balance of which was received on September 24, 2015; (2) within 90 days from the closing, Founders will frac and complete the Rich A-11 No. 1 Well; and (3) within five days of the spudding of each of the next eight wells drilled by Founders, Founders will pay to Farmor $500,000 resulting in the payment of the remaining amount; provided that, in the event that within 90 days after the fracing of the Rich Well, Founders notifies Farmor of its election not to drill any additional wells, Founders shall have no further obligation to make further payment. Upon payment of the first $1,000,000, Farmor assigned to Founders an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest and a 37.5% net revenue interest in the leases subject to the terms of the Farmout Agreement (including obligations to re-assign to HOC and Pandora if the 50% interest in the entire Orogrande Project is not earned) and a proportionate share of the McCabe 10% BIAPO (back in after pay out) interest; provided, however, that for each well that Founders drills prior to earning the acreage, it will be assigned a 50% working interest in the wellbore and in the lease on which it sits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

&#160; 

Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610 &#8211; 1989 Model Form Operating Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures) (&#8220;JOA&#8221;) also entered into on September 23, 2015, Founders Oil &#38; Gas Operating, LLC is designated as operator of the leases. Any variance to the operating plan will be determined by a Development Committee, which committee will be made up of members from Founders and Farmor, or their designees, to discuss and recommend the location of the drill wells, data to be gathered and the form of same. As contemplated under the Farmout Agreement, starting within 90 days of the completion of the fracing on the Rich Well, and at all times subject to the 90 day continuous drilling clause, Founders has the option, but not the obligation, to retain the assigned interest as follows: (1) if Founders spends a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations while maintaining compliance with the continuous drilling clause, subject to reasonable delays resulting from reasonable Force Majeure conditions, Founders will have fulfilled its farmout obligations and will be entitled to retain the assigned interests. If Founders does not meet such obligations, it will reassign to Farmor the assigned interest except it will be entitled to retain its interest in the leases covering all wells drilled by Founders and the sections in which such wells are located. Additionally, Founders will resign as operator of the JOA as to all lands reassigned; and (2) Farmor will be carried in all drilling operations during the first two years and/or $45 million in drilling operations, whichever comes last, subject to Founders&#8217; right to recoup certain expenses on &#8220;Gap Wells.&#8221; After three years and after Founders has earned its working interest, either party may elect to market the acreage as an entire block, including operatorship. Should an acceptable bid arise, and both parties agree, the block will be sold 100% working interest to that third party bidder. However, if only one party wants to accept the outside offer, the other party (the party who wishes not to sell) has the right to purchase the working interest from the selling party. 

&#160;

The Rich A-11 well that was drilled by Torchlight in second quarter, 2015 has been evaluated and numerous scientific tests were performed to provide key data for the field development thesis. During the testing process a poor cement bond was identified preventing a cost effective production test for the primary pay zones. Repair to the well bore necessary for a subsequent frac procedure was determined to be economically unfeasible. With the Rich A-11 designed as a test well rather than commercial target, a decision to begin plans for drilling the next well(s) with larger casing that utilized for future commercial production was made. 

&#160;

Torchlight Energy and Founders have elected to move forward on planning the next phase of drilling in the Orogrande Project. The project operator plans to permit three new wells starting with the University Founders B-19 #1 well. The new wells would be drilled vertically for test purposes and would have sufficient casing size to support lateral entry into any pay zone(s) encountered once the well is tested vertically. Torchlight and the project operator would then run a battery of tests on each well to gain information for future development of the field. 

Industry and Business Environment 

&#160;

Currently, we are experiencing a time of lower oil prices caused by lower demand, higher US Supply, and OPEC&#8217;s policies on production. This has caused oil prices to plummet over the last year from the highs of $105 plus oil per barrel, to reaching lows of below $30 per barrel. Unfortunately, this is the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. We experience highs and lows that seem to come in cycles. Fortunately, advances in technology drive the US market and we feel this will drive the prices down on exploration and drilling programs over time. 

&#160;

Competition 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we will compete with numerous other companies engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas. Some of these companies have substantially greater resources than we have. Not only do they explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also many carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. The operations of other companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties. They may also have more resources to define, evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. 

&#160; 

Our larger or integrated competitors may have the resources to be better able to absorb the burden of current and future federal, state, and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to locate reserves and acquire interests in properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability and resources to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, we may be at a disadvantage in producing oil and natural gas properties and bidding for exploratory prospects because we have fewer financial and human resources than other companies in our industry. Should a larger and better financed company decide to directly compete with us, and be successful in its efforts, our business could be adversely affected. 

Marketing and Customers 

&#160; 

The market for oil and natural gas that we will produce depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels, and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial, and individual consumers. 

&#160; 

Our oil production is expected to be sold at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is expected to be sold under short-term contracts and priced based on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. We will rely on our operating partners to market and sell our production. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to various rules, regulations, and limitations impacting the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry as a whole. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued 

&#160;

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production 

&#160; 

Our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations, when developed, will be subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal, and local authorities and agencies. Certain states may also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of spacing, plugging, and abandonment of such wells. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations and properties are and will be subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation, and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue. These laws and regulations may: 

&#160; 

&#183; require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 

&#183; limit or prohibit construction, drilling, and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; 

&#183; impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; or 

&#183; restrict certain areas from fracking and other stimulation techniques. 

The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are and will be in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our company, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. 

&#160; 

The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint, and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of &#8220;solid waste&#8221; and &#8220;hazardous waste&#8221; and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of &#8220;hazardous substance,&#8221; state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as &#8220;non-hazardous,&#8221; such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish, and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject our company to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force our company to discontinue certain operations altogether.

Climate Change 

&#160; 

Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Many states and the federal government have enacted legislation directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions or requirements in connection with our drilling and production activities and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could affect operating costs and demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted at controlling climate change.
