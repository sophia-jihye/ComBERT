 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

RLI Corp. is an Illinois corporation that was organized in 1965. We underwrite selected property and casualty insurance through major subsidiaries collectively known as RLI Insurance Group. We conduct operations principally through three insurance companies. These companies are organized in a vertical structure beneath RLI Corp. with RLI Insurance Company (RLI Ins.) as the first-level, or principal, insurance subsidiary. RLI Ins. writes multiple lines of insurance on an admitted basis in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (Mt. Hawley), a subsidiary of RLI Ins., writes excess and surplus lines insurance on a non-admitted basis in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. Contractors Bonding and Insurance Company (CBIC), a subsidiary of RLI Ins., write s multiple lines of insurance on an admitted basis in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 2015, we sold RLI Indemnity Company (RIC), a former subsidiary of Mt. Hawley, as a &#8220;shell.&#8221; This transaction was essentially the sale of insurance licenses. All business and cash flows from the former subsidiary remain within the RLI Insurance Group. Each of our insurance companies is domiciled in Illinois. We have no material foreign operations. 

&#160; 

We maintain an Internet website at http://www.rlicorp.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed or furnished. Information contained on our website is not intended to be incorporated by reference in this annual report and you should not consider that information a part of this annual report. 

&#160; 

As a specialty insurance company with a niche focus, we offer insurance coverages in both the specialty admitted and excess and surplus markets. Coverages in the specialty admitted market, such as our energy surety bonds, are for risks that are unique or hard-to-place in the standard market, but must remain with an admitted insurance company for regulatory or marketing reasons. In addition, our coverages in the specialty admitted market may be designed to meet specific insurance needs of targeted insured groups, such as our professional liability and package coverages for design professionals and our stand-alone personal umbrella policy. The specialty admitted market is subject to more state regulation than the excess and surplus market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. We also underwrite coverages in the excess and surplus market. The excess and surplus market, unlike the standard admitted market, is less regulated and more flexible in terms of policy forms and premium rates. This market provides an alternative for customers with risks or loss exposures that generally cannot be written in the standard admitted market. This typically results in coverages that are more restrictive and more expensive than coverages in the standard admitted market. When we underwrite within the excess and surplus market, we are selective in the lines of business and type of risks we choose to write. Using our non-admitted status in this market allows us to tailor terms and conditions to manage these exposures effectively. Often, the development of these coverages is generated through proposals brought to us by an agent or broker seeking coverage for a specific group of clients or loss exposures. Once a proposal is submitted, our underwriters determine whether it would be a viable product based on our business objectives. 

&#160; 

We distribute our property and casualty insurance through our wholly-owned branch offices that market to wholesale and retail producers. W e offer limited coverages on a direct basis to select insureds, as well as various reinsurance coverages, which are distributed through brokers. In addition, from time to time, we produce a limited amount of business under agreements with managing general agents under the direction of our product vice presidents.

In the ordinary course of business, we rely on other insurance companies to share risks through reinsurance. A large portion of the reinsurance is put into effect under contracts known as treaties and, in some instances, by negotiation on each individual risk (known as facultative reinsurance). We have quota share, excess of loss and catastrophe (CAT) reinsurance contracts that protect against losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event. These arrangements allow us to pursue greater diversification of business and serve to limit the maximum net loss on catastrophes and large risks. Reinsurance is subject to certain risks, specifically market risk, which affects the cost of and the ability to secure these contracts, and credit risk, which is the risk that our reinsurers may not pay on losses in a timely fashion or at all. The following table illustrates the degree to which we have utilized reinsurance during the past three years. For an expanded discussion of the impact of reinsurance on our operations, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

SPECIALTY INSURANCE MARKET OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

The specialty insurance market differs significantly from the standard admitted market. In the standard admitted market, insurance rates and forms are highly regulated, products and coverage are largely uniform with relatively predictable exposures and companies tend to compete for customers on the basis of price. In contrast, the specialty market provides coverage for risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of the standard carriers. Competition tends to focus less on price and more on availability, service and other value-based considerations. While specialty market exposures may have higher insurance risks than their standard admitted market counterparts, we manage these risks to achieve higher financial returns. To reach our financial and operational goals, we must have extensive knowledge of, and expertise in, our markets. Many of our risks are underwritten on an individual basis and restricted limits, deductibles, exclusions and surcharges are employed in order to respond to distinctive risk characteristics. We operate in the specialty admitted insurance market, the excess and surplus insurance market and the specialty property and casualty reinsurance markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

SPECIALTY ADMITTED INSURANCE MARKET 

&#160; 

We write business in the specialty admitted market. Most of these risks are unique and hard to place in the standard admitted market, but for marketing and regulatory reasons, they must remain with an admitted insurance company. The specialty admitted market is subject to greater state regulation than the excess and surplus market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. For 2015, our specialty admitted operations produced gross premiums written of $560.2 million, representing approximately 66 percent of our total gross premiums for the year. 

&#160; 

EXCESS AND SURPLUS INSURANCE MARKET 

&#160; 

The excess and surplus market focuses on hard-to-place risks. Participating in this market allows us to underwrite non-standard risks with more flexible policy forms and unregulated premium rates. This typically results in coverages that are more restrictive and more expensive than in the standard admitted market. The excess and surplus lines regulatory environment and productio n model also effectively filter submission flow and match market opportunities to our expertise and appetite. According to the 2015 edition of A.M. Best Aggregate &#38; Averages &#8211; Property/Casualty, United States &#38; Canada , the excess and surplus market represented approximately $28 billion, or 5 percent, of the entire $570 billion domestic property and casualty industry in 2015, as measured by direct premiums written. Our excess and surplus operations wrote gross premiums of $259.9 million, or 30 percent, of our total gross premiums written in 2015. 

&#160; 

SPECIALTY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY REINSURANCE MARKETS 

&#160; 

We write business in the specialty property and casualty reinsurance markets. This business can be written on an individual risk (facultative) basis or on a portfolio (treaty) basis. We write contracts on an excess of loss and a proportional basis. Contract provisions are written and agreed upon between the company and its clients, other (re)insurance companies. The business is typically more volatile as a result of unique underlying exposures and excess and aggregate attachments. This business requires specialized underwriting and technical modeling. For 2015, our specialty property and casualty reinsurance operations wrote gross premiums of $33.5 million, representing approximately 4 percent of our total gross premiums written for the year. 

&#160;

BROKERS 

&#160; 

The largest volume of broker-generated premium is in our commercial property, general liability, commercial surety, commercial umbrella, commercial automobile, medical professional liability and specialty treaty reinsurance coverages. This business is produced through independent wholesale, retail and reinsurance brokers. 

&#160; 

INDEPENDENT AGENTS 

&#160; 

Our surety segment offers its business through a variety of independent agents. Additionally, we target classes of insurance, such as home business and personal umbrella, through independent agents. Homeowners and dwelling fire is produced through independent agents in Hawaii. Several of these programs involve detailed eligibility criteria, which are incorporated into strict underwriting guidelines and prequalification of each risk using a system accessible by the independent agent. The independent agent cannot bind the risk unless they receive approval from our underwriters or through our automated system s . 

&#160; 

&#160;

UNDERWRITING AGENTS 

&#160; 

We contract with certain underwriting agencies, which have limited authority to bind or underwrite business on our behalf. The underwriting agreements involve strict underwriting guidelines and the agents are subject to audits upon request. These agencies may receive some compensation through contingent profit commission. 

&#160; 

ONLINE AND/OR DIRECT 

&#160; 

We are actively employing online efforts to produce and efficiently process and service business including home businesses, jewelry, small commercial and personal umbrella risks and surety bonding. On a direct basis, we also assume premium on various reinsurance treaties. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Our specialty property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are part of a very competitive industry that is cyclical and historically characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe competition and excess underwriting capacity. Within the United States alone, approximately 2,700 companies actively market property and casualty coverages. Our primary competitors in the casualty segment include Arch, Aspen, Baldwin &#38; Lyons, Chubb, CNA, Endurance, Great American, Great West, Hartford, Lancer, Markel, Navigators, RSUI, USLI, Travelers and Zurich. Primary competitors in the property segment include Arch, Aspen, Chubb, CNA, Crum &#38; Forster, Endurance, Great American, Lexington, National Interstate and Travelers. Primary competitors in the surety segment are AIG, Arch, Chubb, CNA, Endurance, Great American, HCC, Navigators, Travelers and XL. The combination of coverages, service, pricing and other methods of competition vary from line to line. Our principal methods of meeting this competition are innovative coverages, marketing structure and quality service to the agents and policyholders at a fair price. We compete favorably, in part, because of our sound financial base and reputation, as well as our broad, geographic penetration in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. In the casualty, property and surety areas, we have experienced underwriting specialists in our branch and home offices. We continue to maintain our underwriting and marketing standards by not seeking market share at the expense of earnings. We have a track record of withdrawing from markets when conditions become overly adverse, and we offer new coverages and programs where the opportunity exists to provide needed insurance coverage with exceptional service on a profitable basis. 

&#160;

Publications of A.M. Best, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s indicate that &#8216;&#8216;A&#8217;&#8217; and &#8216;&#8216;A+&#8217;&#8217; ratings are assigned to those companies that, in their opinion, have achieved excellent overall performance compared to the standards they have established and have a strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. In evaluating a company&#8217;s financial and operating performance, each of the firms review the company&#8217;s profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as the company&#8217;s spread of risk, the quality and appropriateness of its reinsurance, the quality and diversification of its assets, the adequacy of its policy and loss reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, its risk management practices and the experience and objectives of its management. These ratings are based on factors relevant to policyholders, agents, insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not specifically related to securities issued by the company. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the following ratings were assigned to our insurance companies: 

&#160;

&#160; 

For A.M. Best , Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s, the financial strength ratings represented above are affirmations of previously assigned ratings. A.M. Best, in addition to assigning a financial strength rating, also assigns financial size categories. In June 2015, RLI Ins., Mt. Hawley and CBIC, which are collectively rated as a group, were assigned a financial size category of &#8220;XI&#8221; (adjusted policyholders&#8217; surplus of between $750 million and $1 billion). As of December 31, 2015, the policyholders&#8217; statutory surplus of RLI Insurance Group totaled $865.3 million , which continues to result in A.M. Best&#8217;s financial size category &#8220;XI&#8221;. 

&#160; 

REINSURANCE 

&#160; 

We reinsure a portion of our insurance exposure, paying or ceding to the reinsurer a portion of the premiums received on such policies. Earned premiums ceded to non-affiliated reinsurers totaled $132.7 million, $167.1 million and $189.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. We use reinsurance as an alternative to using our own capital to take risks and reduce volatility. Retention levels are evaluated each year to maintain a balance between the growth in surplus and the cost of reinsurance. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the insurance ceded. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance is subject to certain risks, specifically market risk (which affects the cost and ability to secure reinsurance contracts) and credit risk (which relates to the ability to collect from the reinsurer on our claims). We purchase reinsurance from financially strong reinsurers. We evaluate reinsurers&#8217; ability to pay based on their financial results, level of surplus, financial strength ratings and other risk characteristics. A reinsurance committee, comprised of senior management, approves our security guidelines and reinsurer usage. More than 96 percent of our reinsurance recoverables are due from companies with financial strength ratings of &#8220;A&#8221; or better by A.M. Best and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s rating services. For more information regarding our largest reinsurers, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

&#160; 

We utilize both treaty and facultative reinsurance coverage for our risks. Treaty coverage refers to a reinsurance contract under which the company agrees to cede all risks within a defined class of business to the reinsurer, who agrees to provide coverage on all risks ceded without individual underwriting. Facultative coverage is applied to individual risks at the company&#8217;s discretion and is subject to underwriting by the reinsurer . It is used for a variety of reasons, including supplementing the limits provided by the treaty coverage or covering risks or perils excluded from treaty reinsurance. 

&#160; 

Much of our reinsurance is purchased on an excess of loss basis. Under an excess of loss arrangement, we retain losses on a risk up to a specified amount and the reinsurers assume any losses above that amount. We may choose to participate in the reinsurance layers purchased by retaining a percentage of the layer. It is common to find conditions in excess of loss covers 

&#160;

such as occurrence limits, aggregate limits and reinstatement premium charges. Occurrence limits cap our recovery for multiple losses caused by the same event. Aggregate limits cap our recovery for all losses ceded during the contract term. We may be required to pay additional premium to reinstate or have access to use the reinsurance limits for potential future recoveries during the same contract year. Some property and surety treaties include reinstatement provisions which require us, in certain circumstances, to pay reinstatement premiums after a loss has occurred in order to preserve coverage. 

&#160; 

Excluding CAT reinsurance, the following table summarizes the reinsurance treaty coverage currently in effect:

* Maximum retention includes first-dollar retention plus any co-participation we retain through the reinsurance tower. 

** A limited number of commercial and energy surety accounts are permitted to exceed the $65.0 million limit. These accounts are subject to additional levels of review and are monitored on a monthly basis. 

&#160; 

At each renewal, we consider any plans to change the underlying insurance coverage we offer, as well as updated loss activity, the level of RLI Insurance Group&#8217;s surplus, changes in our risk appetite and the cost and availability of reinsurance treaties. In the last renewal cycle, we maintained similar retentions on most lines of business. 

&#160; 

PROPERTY REINSURANCE &#8212; CATASTROPHE COVERAGE 

&#160; 

Our property CAT reinsurance reduces the financial impact of a CAT event involving multiple claims and policyholders. Reinsurance limits purchased fluctuate due to changes in the amount of exposure we insure, reinsurance costs, insurance company surplus levels and our risk appetite. In addition, we monitor the expected rate of return for each of our CAT lines of business. At high rates of return, we grow the book of business and may purchase additional reinsurance to increase our capacity. As the rate of return decreases, we shrink the book and may purchase less reinsurance as this capacity is unnecessary. Our reinsurance coverage for the last three years and for 2016 &#160; are shown in the following table :

These CAT limits are in addition to the per-occurrence coverage provided by facultative and other treaty coverages. We have participated in the CAT layers purchased by retaining a percentage of each layer throughout this period. Our participation has varied based on price and the amount of risk transferred by each layer. Since 2014, all layers of the treaty have included one prepaid reinstatement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our property CAT program continues to be applied on an excess of loss basis. It attaches after all other reinsurance has been considered. Although covered in one program, limits and attachment points differ for California earthquakes and all other perils. The following charts use information from our CAT modeling software to illustrate our pre-tax net retention resulting from particular events that would generate the gross losses shown in the table s :

In the above table, projected losses for 2016 were estimated based on our exposure as of December 31, 2015, utilizing the treaty structure in place as of January 1, 2016. All previous years were estimated similarly by utilizing the exposure at the end of each respective year and the treaty structure in place at the start of the following year. 

&#160; 

The previous tables were generated using theoretical probabilities of events occurring in areas where our portfolio of currently in-force policies could generate the level of loss illustrated. Actual results could vary significantly from these tables as the actual nature or severity of a particular event cannot be predicted with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Reinsurance limits are purchased based on the anticipated losses from large events. The largest losses shown above are possible, but have a low probability of actually occurring. However, there is a remote chance that a larger event could occur. If the actual event losses are larger than anticipated, we could retain additional losses above the limit of our CAT reinsurance. 

&#160; 

We continuously monitor and quantify our exposure to catastrophes including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, convective storms, terrorist acts and other aggregating events. In the normal course of business, we manage our concentrations of exposures to catastrophic events, primarily by limiting concentrations of locations insured to acceptable levels and by purchasing reinsurance. Exposure and coverage detail is recorded for each risk location. We quantify and monitor the total policy limit insured in each geographical region. In addition, we use third-party CAT exposure models and an internally developed analysis to assess each risk to ensure we include an appropriate charge for assumed CAT risks. CAT exposure modeling is inherently uncertain due to the model&#8217;s reliance on an infrequent observation of actual events and exposure data, increasing the importance of capturing accurate policy coverage data. The model results are used both in the underwriting analysis of individual risks and at a corporate level for the aggregate book of CAT-exposed business. From both perspectives, we consider the potential loss produced by individual events that represent moderate-to-high loss potential at varying probabilities and magnitudes. In calculating potential losses, we select appropriate assumptions including, but not limited to, loss amplification and loss adjustment expense. We establish risk tolerances at the portfolio level based on market conditions, the level of reinsurance available, changes to the assumptions in the CAT models, rating agency capital constraints, underwriting guidelines and coverages and internal preferences. Our risk tolerances for each type of CAT, and for all perils in aggregate, change over time as these internal and external conditions change. We are required to report to the rating agencies estimated loss to a single event that could include all potential earthquakes and hurricanes contemplated by the CAT modeling software. This reported loss includes the impact of insured losses based on the estimated frequency and severity of potential events, loss adjustment expense, reinstatements paid after the loss, reinsurance recoveries and taxes. Based on the CAT reinsurance treaty purchased on January 1, 2016, there is a 99.6 percent likelihood that the loss will be less than 8.2 percent of policyholders&#8217; surplus as of December 31, 2015. Our exposure to CAT losses has been relatively stable based on multiple views of risk including policy counts, policy limits insured and modeled losses based on multiple CAT models. The exposure levels are still well within our tolerances for this risk. 

&#160;

LOSSES AND SETTLEMENT EXPENSES 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) reserves represent our best estimate of ultimate payments for losses and related settlement expenses from claims that have been reported but not paid and losses that have been incurred but not yet reported to us (IBNR). Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent our estimates, generally utilizing individual claim estimates, actuarial expertise and estimation techniques at a given accounting date. The loss reserve estimates are expectations of what ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution. These estimates are based on facts and circumstances then known to us, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity, projections of loss costs, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and many other factors. In establishing reserves, we also take into account estimated recoveries from reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by a team of actuaries we employ. 

&#160; 

Net loss and loss adjustment reserves by product line at year-end 2015 and 2014 are illustrated in the following table. LAE is classified in the table as either allocated loss adjustment expense (ALAE) or unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE). ALAE refers to estimates of claim settlement expenses that can be identified with a specific claim or case, while ULAE cannot be identified with a specific claim. For a detailed discussion of loss reserves, refer to our critical accounting policy in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Following is a table of significant risk factors involved in estimating losses grouped by major product line. We distinguish between loss ratio risk and reserve estimation risk. Loss ratio risk refers to the possible dispersion of loss ratios from year to year due to inherent volatility in the business, such as high severity or aggregating exposures. Reserve estimation risk recognizes the difficulty in estimating a given year&#8217;s ultimate loss liability. As an example, our property CAT business (included below in &#8220;Other property&#8221;) has significant variance in year-over-year results; however its reserving estimation risk is relatively moderate.

A full analysis of our loss reserves takes place three times a year . The purpose of this analysis is to provide validation of our carried loss reserves. Estimates of the expected value of the unpaid loss and LAE are derived using actuarial 

&#160;

methodologies. These estimates are then compared to the carried loss reserves to determine the appropriateness of the current reserve balance. 

&#160; 

The methodologies we have chosen to incorporate are a function of data availability and are reflective of our own book of business. From time to time, we evaluate the need to add supplementary methodologies. New methods are incorporated if it is believed that they improve the estimate of our ultimate loss and LAE liability. All of the actuarial methods eventually converge to the same estimate as an accident year matures. Our core methodologies are listed below with a short description and their relative strengths and weaknesses: 

&#160; 

Paid Loss Development &#8212; Historical payment patterns for prior claims are used to estimate future payment patterns for current claims. These patterns are applied to current payments by accident year to yield an expected ultimate loss. 

&#160; 

Strengths : The method reflects only the claim dollars that have been paid and is not subject to case-basis reserve changes or changes in case reserve practices. 

&#160; 

Weaknesses : External claims environment changes can impact the rate at which claims are settled and losses paid (e.g. increase in attorney involvement or legal precedent). Adjustments to reflect changes in payment patterns on a prospective basis are difficult to quantify. For losses that have occurred recently, payments can be minimal and thus early estimates are subject to significant instability. 

&#160; 

Incurred Loss Development &#8212; Historical case-incurred patterns (paid losses plus case reserves) for past claims are used to estimate future case-incurred amounts for current claims. These patterns are applied to current case-incurred losses by accident year to yield an expected ultimate loss. 

&#160; 

Strengths : Losses are reported more quickly than paid, therefore, the estimates stabilize sooner. The method reflects more information in the analysis than the paid loss development method. 

&#160; 

Weaknesses : Method involves additional estimation risk if significant changes to case reserving practices have occurred. 

&#160; 

Case Reserve Development &#8212; Patterns of historical development in reported losses relative to historical case reserves are determined. These patterns are applied to current case reserves by accident year and the result is combined with paid losses to yield an expected ultimate loss. 

&#160; 

Strengths : Like the incurred development method, this method benefits from using the additional information available in case reserves that is not available from paid losses only. It also can provide a more reasonable estimate than other methods when the proportion of claims still open for an accident year is unusually high or low. 

&#160; 

Weaknesses : It is subject to the risk of changes in case reserving practices or philosophy. It may provide unstable estimates when an accident year is immature and more of the IBNR is expected to come from unreported claims rather than development on reported claims and when accident years are very mature with infrequent case reserves. 

&#160; 

Expected Loss Ratio &#8212; Historical loss ratios, in combination with projections of frequency and severity trends, as well as estimates of price and exposure changes, are analyzed to produce an estimate of the expected loss ratio for each accident year. The expected loss ratio is then applied to the earned premium for each year to estimate the expected ultimate losses. The current accident year expected loss ratio is also the prospective loss and ALAE ratio used in our initial IBNR generation process. 

&#160; 

Strengths : Reflects an estimate independent of how losses are emerging on either a paid or a case reserve basis. This method is particularly useful in the absence of historical development patterns or where losses take a long time to emerge. 

&#160; 

Weaknesses : Ignores how losses are actually emerging and thus produces the same estimate of ultimate loss regardless of favorable/unfavorable emergence. 

&#160; 

Paid and Incurred Bornhuetter/Ferguson (BF) &#8212; This approach blends the expected loss ratio method with either the paid or incurred loss development method. In effect, the BF methods produce weighted average indications for each accident year. As an example, if the current accident year for commercial automobile liability is estimated to be 20 percent paid, then the paid loss development method would receive a weight of 20 percent and the expected loss ratio method would receive an 80 percent weight. Over time, this method will converge with the ultimate estimated by the respective loss development method. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Strengths : Reflects actual emergence that is favorable/unfavorable, but assumes remaining emergence will continue as previously expected. Does not overreact to the early emergence (or lack of emergence) where patterns are most unstable. 

&#160; 

Weaknesses : Could potentially understate favorable or unfavorable development by putting weight on the expected loss ratio. 

&#160; 

In most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations, and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods, when applied to a particular group of claims, can also change over time. Therefore, the weight given to each estimation method will likely change by accident year and with each evaluation. 

&#160; 

The actuarial central estimates typically follow a progression that places significant weight on the BF methods when accident years are younger and claims emergence is immature. As accident years mature and claims emerge over time, increasing weight is placed on the incurred development method, the paid development method and the case reserve development method. For product lines with faster loss emergence, the progression to greater weight on the incurred and paid development methods occurs more quickly. 

&#160; 

For our long and medium-tail products, the BF methods are typically given the most weight for the first 36 months of evaluation. These methods are also predominant for the first 12 months of evaluation for short-tail lines. Beyond these time periods, our actuaries apply their professional judgment when weighting the estimates from the various methods deployed but place significant reliance on the expected stage of development in normal circumstances. 

&#160; 

Judgment can supersede this natural progression if risk factors and assumptions change, or if a situation occurs that amplifies a particular strength or weakness of a methodology. Extreme projections are critically analyzed and may be adjusted, given less credence or discarded altogether. Internal documentation is maintained that records any substantial changes in methods or assumptions from one loss reserve study to another. 

&#160; 

RESERVE SENSITIVITIES 

&#160; 

There are three major parameters that have significant influence on our actuarial estimates of ultimate liabilities by product. They are the actual losses that are reported, the expected loss emergence pattern and the expected loss ratios used in the analyses. If the actual losses reported do not emerge as expected, it may cause us to challenge all or some of our previous assumptions. We may change expected loss emergence patterns, the expected loss ratios used in our analysis and/or the weights we place on a given actuarial method. The impact will be much greater and more leveraged for products with longer emergence patterns. Our general liability product is an example of a product with a relatively long emergence pattern. We have constructed a chart on the following page that illustrates the sensitivity of our general liability reserve estimates to these key parameters. We believe the scenarios to be reasonable as similar favorable variations have occurred in recent years. For example, while our general liability emergence has ranged from 6 percent to 29 percent favorable over the last three years, our emergence for all products combined, excluding general liability, has ranged from 1 5 percent to 23 percent favorable. The numbers below are the changes in estimated ultimate loss and ALAE in millions of dollars as of December 31, 2015, resulting from the change in the parameters shown. These parameters were applied to a general liability net loss and LAE reserve balance of $ 230.7 million at December 31, 2015, in addition to associated ULAE and latent liability reserves.

&#160; 

There are often significant inter-relationships between our reserving assumptions that have offsetting or compounding effects on the reserve estimate. Thus, in almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single assumption or construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation that holds true in all cases. The scenario above is representative of general liability, one of our largest and longest-tailed products. It is unlikely that all of our products would have variations as wide as illustrated in the example. It is also unlikely that all of our products would simultaneously experience favorable or unfavorable loss development in the same direction or at their extremes during a calendar year. Because our portfolio is made up of a diversified mix of products, there would ordinarily be some offsetting favorable and unfavorable emergence by product as actual losses start to emerge and our loss estimates become more reliable. 

&#160; 

It is difficult for us to predict whether the favorable l oss development observed in 2005 through 2015 will continue for any of our products in the future. We have reviewed historical data detailing the development of our total balance sheet reserves and changes in accident year loss ratios relative to original estimates. Based on this analysis and our understanding of loss reserve uncertainty, we believe fluctuations will occur in our estimate of ultimate reserve liabilities over time. Over the next calendar year, given our current exposure level and product mix, it would be reasonably likely for us to observe loss reserve development relating to prior years&#8217; estimates across all of our products ranging from approximately 10 percent ($ 80 million) favorable to 3 percent ($2 4 million) unfavorable. 

&#160; 

HISTORICAL LOSS AND LAE DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

The following table presents the development of our balance sheet reserves from 2005 through 2015. The top line of the table shows the net reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated periods. This represents the estimated amount of net losses and settlement expenses arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded net reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year, as well as the re-estimated previously recorded gross reserves as of December 31, 2015. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual periods. 

&#160; 

Favorable loss and LAE reserve development can be observed in the table for all years ending on both a net and gross basis. As the table displays, variations exist between our cumulative loss experience on a gross and net basis due to the application of reinsurance. On certain products, our net retention (after applying reinsurance) is significantly less than our gross retention (before applying reinsurance). These differences in retention can cause a significant (leveraged) difference between loss reserve development on a net and gross basis. As the relationship of our gross to net retention changes over time, re-estimation of loss reserves will result in variations between our cumulative loss experience on a gross and net basis.

PREMIUMS TO SURPLUS RATIO 

&#160; 

The following table shows, for the periods indicated, our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; statutory ratios of net premiums written to policyholders&#8217; surplus. While there is no statutory requirement applicable to us that establishes a permissible net premiums written to surplus ratio, guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provide that this ratio should generally be no greater than 3 to 1. While the NAIC provides this general guideline, rating agencies often require a more conservative ratio to maintain strong or superior ratings.

GAAP AND STATUTORY COMBINED RATIOS 

&#160; 

Our underwriting experience is best indicated by our GAAP combined ratio, which is the sum of (a) the ratio of incurred losses and settlement expenses to net premiums earned (loss ratio) and (b) the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums earned (expense ratio). The difference between the combined ratio and 100 reflects the per-dollar rate of underwriting income or loss.

We also calculate the statutory combined ratio, which is not indicative of GAAP underwriting income due to accounting for policy acquisition costs differently for statutory accounting purposes compared to GAAP. The statutory combined ratio is the sum of (a) the ratio of statutory loss and settlement expenses incurred to statutory net premiums earned (loss ratio) and (b) the ratio of statutory policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to statutory net premiums written (expense ratio). The difference between the combined ratio and 100 reflects the per-dollar rate of underwriting income or loss.

INVESTMENTS 

&#160; 

Our investment portfolio serves as the primary resource for loss payments and secondly as a source of income to support operations. Our investment strategy is based on preservation of capital as the first priority, with a secondary focus on growing book value through total return. Investments of the highest quality and marketability are critical for preserving our claims-paying ability. Our portfolio contains no derivatives or off-balance sheet structured investments. In addition, we have a diversified investment portfolio which distributes credit risk across many issuers and a policy that limits aggregate credit exposure. Despite periodic fluctuations in market value, our equity portfolio is part of a long-term asset allocation strategy and has contributed significantly to our growth in book value. 

&#160; 

Investment portfolios are managed both internally and externally by experienced portfolio managers. We follow an investment policy that is reviewed quarterly and revised periodically, with oversight conducted by our senior officers and board of directors. 

&#160; 

Our investments include fixed income debt securities, common stock equity securities , exchange traded funds (ETFs) and a small number of limited partnership interests . During 2015, the majority of available cash flows were invested in fixed income securities. Our equity allocation decreased to 19 percent of the overall portfolio. During the year, we initiated an investment in a real estate fund, which is included in other invested assets. This investment together with low income housing tax credit partnership s and membership stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago represented one percent of the total portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, 82 percent of the fixed income portfolio was rated A or better and 65 percent was rated AA or better. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We classify all of the securities in our fixed income portfolio as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value. The available-for-sale portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity and can be used to address potential future changes in our asset/liability structure. 

&#160; 

Aggregate maturities for the fixed-income portfolio as of December 31, 2015, are as follows:

&#160; 

REGULATION 

&#160; 

STATE REGULATION 

&#160; 

As an insurance holding company, we, as well as our insurance company subsidiaries, are subject to regulation by the states and territories in which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business. Holding company registration in each insurer&#8217;s state of domicile requires periodic reporting to the state regulatory authority of the financial, operational and management data of the insurers within the holding company system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must have fair and reasonable terms, and the insurer&#8217;s policyholder surplus following any transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs. Notice to, and in some cases consent from, regulators are required prior to the consummation of certain transactions affecting insurance company subsidiaries of the holding company system. Each state and territory individually regulates the insurance operations of both insurance companies and insurance agents/brokers. Because our insurance companies operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam, we must comply with the individual insurance laws, regulations, rules and case law of each state and territory , including those regulating the filing of insurance rates and forms. Each of our three insurance company subsidiaries is domiciled in Illinois, with the Illinois Department of Insurance (IDOI) as their principal insurance regulator. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The insurance holding company laws also require that ordinary dividends paid by an insurance company be reported to the insurer&#8217;s domiciliary regulator prior to payment of the dividend and that extraordinary dividends may not be paid without such regulator&#8217;s prior approval. An extraordinary dividend is generally defined under Illinois law as a dividend that, together with all other dividends made within the past 12 months, exceeds the greater of 100 percent of the insurer&#8217;s statutory net income for the most recent calendar year or 10 percent of its statutory policyholders&#8217; surplus as of the preceding year end. Insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that extraordinary dividend payments would be permitted. 

&#160; 

Two primary focuses of state insurance regulation of insurance companies are financial solvency and market conduct practices. These regulations impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments our insurance company subsidiaries may have. Regulations designed to ensure financial solvency of insurers and require fair and adequate treatment and service for policyholders are enforced by various filing, reporting and examination requirements. Marketplace oversight is conducted by monitoring and periodically examining trade practices, approving policy forms, licensing of agents and brokers and requiring the filing and, in some cases, approval of premiums and commission rates to ensure they are fair and equitable. Financial solvency is monitored by minimum reserve and capital requirements (including risk-based capital requirements), periodic financial reporting procedures (annually, quarterly or more frequently if necessary) and periodic examinations. 

&#160; 

The quarterly and annual financial reports to the states utilize statutory accounting principles that are different from GAAP, which present the business as a going concern. The statutory accounting principles used by insurance regulators, in keeping with the intent to assure policyholder protection, are generally based on a solvency concept. 

&#160; 

Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a withdrawal plan that may lead to marketplace disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable marketplaces in a timely manner. 

&#160; 

In addition, state-level changes to the insurance regulatory environment are frequent, including changes caused by state legislation, regulations by the state insurance regulators and court rulings. State insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The NAIC is a non-governmental regulatory support organization that seeks to promote uniformity and to enhance state regulation of insurance through various activities, initiatives and programs. Among other regulatory and insurance company support activities, the NAIC maintains a state insurance department accreditation program and proposes model laws, regulations and guidelines for approval by state legislatures and insurance regulators. Such proposed laws and regulations cover areas including risk assessments, corporate governance and financial and accounting rules. To the extent such proposed model laws and regulations are adopted by states, they will apply to insurance carriers. 

&#160; 

The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (&#8220; ORSA &#8221;) model act was developed by the NAIC and proposed for adoption by each state insurance regulatory department. &#160; In 2015, the Illinois legislature adopted the Risk Management and ORSA law , applicable to all Illinois-domiciled insurance companies , including ours. The ORSA program is a key component of an insurance company&#8217;s overall enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, which is the process by which organizations identify, measure, monitor and manage key risks affecting the entire enterprise. An ORSA report, filed by us with the IDOI each year, is an internal identification, description and assessment of the risks associated with our business plan, and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Our ORSA report was filed with the IDOI in 2015, and will be updated and filed annually. 

&#160; 

Virtually all states require licensed insurers to participate in various forms of guaranty associations in order to bear a portion of the loss suffered by the policyholders of insurance companies that become insolvent. Depending upon state law, licensed insurers can be assessed an amount that is generally equal to a small percentage of the annual premiums written for the relevant lines of insurance in that state to pay the claims of an insolvent insurer. These assessments may increase or decrease in the future, depending upon the rate of insolvencies of insurance companies. In some states, these assessments may be wholly or partially recovered through policy fees paid by insureds. 

&#160; 

In addition, the insurance holding company laws require advance approval by state insurance commissioners of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled (or, in some cases, having such substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled) in that state. &#8220;Control&#8221; is generally presumed to exist through the ownership of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any company that controls a domestic insurance 

&#160;

company. In addition, insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre-notification to the insurance commissioners of a change in control of a non-domestic insurance company licensed in those states. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of our insurance company subsidiaries, including a change of control of us, would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval by the insurance departments of the insurance company subsidiaries&#8217; state of domicile (Illinois) or commercial domicile, if any, and may require pre-acquisition notification in applicable states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions. Obtaining these approvals could result in a material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. 

&#160; 

In addition to monitoring our existing regulatory obligations, we are also monitoring developments in the following areas to determine the potential effect on our business and to comply with our legal obligations. 

&#160; 

FEDERAL LEGISLATION / REGULATION 

&#160; 

The U.S. insurance industry is not currently subject to any significant federal regulation and instead is regulated principally at the state level. However, the federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and creation of the Federal Insurance Office (summarized below) include elements that affect the insurance industry, insurance companies and public companies such as ours. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act established several significant corporate governance-related laws and Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations applicable to public companies. The Dodd-Frank Act created significant changes in regulatory structures of banking and other financial institutions, created new governmental agencies (while merging and removing others), increased oversight of financial institutions and enhanced regulation of capital markets. The legislation also mandates new rules affecting executive compensation and corporate governance for public companies such as ours. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains insurance industry-specific provisions, including establishment of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and streamlining the regulation and taxation of surplus lines insurance and reinsurance among the states. The FIO, part of the U.S. Department of Treasury, has limited authority and no direct regulatory authority over the business of insurance. FIO&#8217;s principal mandates include monitoring the insurance industry, collection of insurance industry information and data and representation of the U.S. with international insurance regulators. Although the FIO does not provide substantive regulation of the insurance industry at this time, we will monitor its activities carefully for any regulatory impact on our company. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act affecting our company will be implemented over time by various federal agencies, including the SEC. Full implementation is expected to take several more years. We will continue to monitor, implement and comply with all Dodd-Frank Act-related changes to our regulatory environment, any FIO initiatives and any other federal legislation impacting our company. 

&#160; 

As part of the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA), in January 2015, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) was established by federal law, which is expected to streamline insurance agent/broker licensing. 

&#160; 

Other federal laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our company and its business operations. This federal regulation includes, without limitation, laws affecting privacy and data security and credit reporting &#8212; examples of which include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; and international economic and trade sanctions &#8212; examples of which include the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act (ITR/SHR). ITR/SHR generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in certain transactions with the government of Iran or certain Iranian businesses, including provision of insurance or reinsurance. Under ITR/SHR, we must disclose whether we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities identified in that law. For the year 2015, neither we nor our affiliates have knowingly engaged in any transaction or dealing reportable under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, as required by the ITR/SHR. 

&#160; 

LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS 

&#160; 

We enter into various license arrangements with third parties and vendors on a regular basis for various goods and services. For example, we have license agreements with third parties for a variety of services, including natural catastrophe modeling, policy management, claims processing, producer management and accounting/financial management. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We hold a U.S. federal service mark registration of our corporate logo &#8220;RLI&#8221; and several other company service marks and trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Such registrations protect our intellectual property nationwide from deceptively similar use. The duration of these registrations is 10 years, unless renewed. We monitor our trademarks and service marks and protect them from unauthorized use as necessary. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of 902 associates. Of the 902 total associates, 36 were part-time and 866 were full-time. 

&#160;
