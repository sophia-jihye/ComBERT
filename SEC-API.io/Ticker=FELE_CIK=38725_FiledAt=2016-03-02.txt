Business Segments and Products 

Segment and geographic information appears in Note 16, &#8220;Segment and Geographic Information&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements. 

Water Systems Segment 

Water Systems is a global leader in the production and marketing of water pumping systems and is a technical leader in submersible motors, pumps, drives, electronic controls, and monitoring devices. The Water Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells motors, pumps, electronic controls and related parts and equipment primarily for use in groundwater, wastewater, and fuel transfer applications. 

Water Systems motors and pumps are used principally for pumping clean water and wastewater in a variety of residential, agricultural, and industrial applications. Water Systems also manufactures electronic drives and controls for the motors which control functionality and provide protection from various hazards, such as electric surges, over-heating, or dry wells or tanks. 

The Water Systems business has grown from a domestic submersible motor manufacturer to a global manufacturer of systems and components for the movement of water and automotive fuels. Founded in the 1940s, the Company made submersible motors for pumps for much of its history. About 10 years ago, it entered the pump business, and has since grown through acquisitions. &#32; Highlights of the Water Systems business transformation, from its origins to the present, are as follows: 

&#8226; 

1950s - Domestic submersible motor manufacturer 

&#8226; 

1990s - Global manufacturer of submersible motors, electronic drives and controls selling to pump OEMs 

&#8226;

Water Systems products are sold in highly competitive markets. Water-pumping systems contribute about 80 percent of revenue. Significant portions of segment revenue come from selling groundwater and surface pumps to residential and commercial buildings, a relatively stable business, as well as agricultural sales which are more seasonal and subject to commodity price changes. The Water segment generates 40 percent of its revenue in developing markets, which often lack municipal water systems. As those countries bring systems up to date, the Company views those markets as an opportunity. The Company has had 15 to 20 percent compounded annual sales growth in those regions in recent years. Water Systems competes in each of its targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and services, performance, availability, and price. The Company's principal competitors in the specialty water products industry are Grundfos Management A/S, Pentair, Inc., and Xylem, Inc. 

2015 Water Systems research and development expenditures were primarily related to the following activities: 

&#8226; 

Electronic drives and controls for submersible pumping and HVAC applications 

&#8226; 

Submersible pumping technology, including the new Fhoton TM Solar Drive system &#160; 

&#8226; 

Submersible and surface pumps for agricultural and municipal applications 

&#8226; 

Gray water pumping equipment, including the Pit+Plus &#174; Basin System, IGPH series high head grinder pumps, and Battery Backup Sump Pump Kits 

&#8226; 

Submersible motor technology and motor protection 

&#8226; 

Artificial Lift systems for gas well dewatering and oil pumping, including a new drive system and deeper set pumps 

Fueling Systems Segment 

Fueling Systems is a global leader in the production and marketing of fuel pumping systems, fuel containment systems, and monitoring and control systems. The Fueling Systems segment designs, manufactures and sells pumps, pipe, sumps, fittings, vapor recovery components, electronic controls, monitoring devices and related parts and equipment primarily for use in submersible fueling system applications. 

Fueling Systems has expanded its product offerings through internal development and acquisitions. Highlights of the Fueling Systems history are as follows:

2014 - Acquired majority interest, 65%, in Wadcorpp India Private Limited, India, a distributor of fueling equipment 

&#160; 

Fueling Systems products are sold in highly competitive markets. In Fueling Systems, rising car use is leading to more investment in gas stations which, in turn, leads to increased demand for the Company&#8217;s Fueling Systems products. The Company believes there is growth opportunity in developing markets and, accordingly, acquired an investment in India in 2014. Fueling Systems competes in each of its targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and services, performance, availability, and price. The Company's principal competitors in the petroleum equipment industry are Danaher Corporation and Dover Corporation. 

2015 Fueling Systems research and development expenditures were primarily related to the following activities: 

&#8226;

The backlog is composed of written orders at prices adjustable on a price-at-the-time-of-shipment basis for products, primarily standard catalog items. All backlog orders are expected to be filled in fiscal 2016 . The Company&#8217;s sales in the first quarter are generally less than its sales in other quarters due to generally less water well drilling and overall product sales during the winter months in the Northern hemisphere. Beyond that, there is no seasonal pattern to the backlog and the backlog has not proven to be a significant indicator of future sales. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws concerning the discharge of material into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. The Company has not experienced any material costs in connection with environmental compliance, and does not believe that such compliance will have any material effect upon the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position of the Company.
