Ore to ash ratio expresses the number of short tons of trona ore used to produce one short ton of soda ash and liquor and includes our deca rehydration recovery process. In general, a lower ore to ash ratio results in lower costs and improved efficiency. 

Trona, a naturally occurring soft mineral, is also known as sodium sesquicarbonate and consists primarily of sodium carbonate, or soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and water. We process trona ore into soda ash, which is an essential raw material in flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. The vast majority of the world&#8217;s accessible trona reserves are located in the Green River Basin. According to historical production statistics, approximately one-quarter of global soda ash is produced by processing trona, with the remainder being produced synthetically through chemical processes. We believe processing soda ash from trona is the cheapest manner in which to produce soda ash. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, we believe trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths enable us and will continue to allow us to execute our business strategies successfully and to achieve our objective of generating and growing cash available for distribution to our unitholders: 

Cost Advantages of Producing Soda Ash from Trona. We believe that as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have a significant competitive advantage compared to synthetic producers of soda ash. The manufacturing and processing costs for producing soda ash from trona are more cost competitive than other manufacturing techniques partly because the costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, we believe trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. As the global economy has slowed, many global commodities have been in a state of oversupply that has led to lower costs. As a result, the total cost to produce synthetic soda ash has fallen as much as 20-30% over the past year. In addition, our inland logistics costs have been rising since 2014, likely at a faster pace than what has been experienced by our competitors in other regions of the world. In spite of this and based on our estimates and industry sources, we believe the average cost of production per short ton of soda ash (before freight and logistics costs) from trona is approximately 40% to 60% &#32;the cost per short ton of soda ash from synthetic production. In addition, synthetic producers of soda ash incur additional costs associated with storing or disposing of, or 

&#32; 

attempting to resell, the by-products the synthetic processes produce. Even after taking into account the higher freight and logistics costs associated with our soda ash exports, we believe we can be cost competitive with synthetic soda ash operations who are typically located closer to customers than we are. We believe that our competitive cost structure, together with our current logistics arrangements, allows us to be competitive globally. 

Synergies created from Ciner Group. Since Ciner Group&#8217;s acquisition of our business, Ciner Group is now the largest global producer of natural soda ash derived from trona based sources. Ciner Group has long-standing relationships with many European based global customers that we feel will improve our positioning with key customer accounts in North America and Europe. In addition, we believe there are opportunities to leverage technologies across the group to enhance our relative competitive cost position. 

Substantial Reserve Life from Significant Reserves. Our reserve estimate, as of December 31, 2015 , was prepared by our internal staff of mine engineers (the &#8220;Ciner Resources staff&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , the Ciner Resources staff estimated we had proven and probable reserves of approximately 267.5 million &#32;short tons of trona, which is equivalent to 145.8 million &#32;short tons of soda ash. Based on a projected mining rate of 4.0 million &#32;short tons of trona per year, we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona for approximately 67 years. Please see Item 1, Business, &#8220;Trona Reserves&#8221; for more information. 

Certain Operational Advantages Compared to Other U.S. Trona-Based Producers. We believe we have certain operational advantages over other soda ash producers in the Green River Basin due to the operational characteristics of our facilities as described below. These advantages are manifested in our high productivity and efficiency rates. 

&#8226; 

Location of our mining beds and high purity trona. Our mining beds are located 800 &#32;to 1100 feet below the surface, which is significantly closer to the surface than the mining beds of other operators in the Green River Basin. The relatively shallow depth of our beds compared to other Green River Basin trona mines contributes to favorable ground conditions and improved mining efficiency. Our competitive advantage resides in the fact that we can mine and roof bolt continuously while mining. In addition, the trona in our mining beds has a higher concentration of soda ash as compared to the trona mined at other locations in the Green River Basin, which is typically imbedded or mixed with greater amounts of halite and other impurities. Our trona ore is generally composed of approximately 85% to 89% pure trona. 

&#8226; 

Advantageous facility layout. Our surface site includes a high capacity network of ponds that we use to recapture soda ash lost in processing trona through a process we introduced in 2009 called deca rehydration. Primarily as a result of this process, we have been able to reduce our ore to ash ratio by 5% &#32;over the past five &#32;years. While other producers in the Green River Basin also utilize deca rehydration, our pond complex enables us to spread deca-saturated water over a large surface area, which facilitates evaporation and access to the resulting deca. Additionally, we can transfer water from one pond to another, a process we call &#8220;de-watering,&#8221; leaving the first pond dry. De-watering enables us to use front loaders and other hauling equipment to move dry deca from that &#8220;de-watered&#8221; pond to our processing facility. Other producers in the area instead need to utilize costly dredging techniques to extract deca from their ponds, and the recovered deca is wet, and therefore requires more energy to process than dry deca. Introducing dry deca into our process has also reduced our energy consumption per short ton of soda ash produced. 

Partly due to these operational advantages over other domestic producers, we believe we have the most efficient soda ash production facility in the Green River Basin both in terms of short tons of soda ash produced per employee and in energy consumed per short ton of soda ash produced. In 2015 , we used approximately 3.8 &#32;MMBtus of energy per short ton of soda ash processed, as compared to an average of 5.5 MMBtus of energy for the other three operators in the Green River Basin according to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality and our internal estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we produced approximately 6,200 &#32;short tons of soda ash per employee. Based on historical production statistics we believe this production metric exceeds that of the other three operators in the Green River Basin. 

Strong Safety Record. We have an outstanding track record for safety, and we have among the lowest instances of workplace injury in the U.S. mining industry. Our Green River Basin facility maintains a rigorous safety program. Ciner Corp and its affiliates&#8217; employees and contractors who operate our assets are required to complete 40 hours of initial training, as well as eight-hour annual refresher sessions. These training programs cover all of the potential site-specific hazards present at the facility. As a direct result of our commitment to safety, we have had an exceptional safety record in recent years. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our facility had no &#32;lost work day injuries and thre e recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. In 2015, we had the lowest citation, injury, and recordable rate among all of our peers in the Green River Basin. We also have an outstanding Mine Rescue team that took home the 2015 Mine Rescue Championship trophy. 

Stable Customer Relationships. We have an extensive base of more than 80 &#32;domestic customers in industries such as flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers due to our competitive pricing, reliable shipping and high quality soda ash. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 61.6% &#32;of our domestic net sales were made to customers with whom we have done business for over ten years. We believe that these relationships lead to stable cash flows. We have a strong, long-standing relationship with our primary export customer, ANSAC. ANSAC is a cooperative that serves as the primary international distribution channel for us and two other U.S. 

&#32; 

manufacturers of trona-based soda ash. ANSAC is one of the largest purchasers and exporters of soda ash in the world and, as a result, is able to leverage its economies of scale in the markets it serves. We believe that our customer relationships, including our relationship with ANSAC, lead to more stable cash flows and allow us to plan production activity more accurately. 

Experienced Management and Workforce. Our facility has been in continuous operation for over 50 years. We are able to build on the collective knowledge gained from our experience during this period to continually improve our operations and introduce innovative processes. In addition, many members of Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s senior management team have more than 20 years of relevant industry experience. Our executives lead a highly productive workforce with an average tenure of approximately 16.7 years . We believe our institutional knowledge, coupled with the relative seniority of our workforce, engenders a strong sense of teamwork and collegiality, which has led to one of the safest and most efficient operations in the industry today. 

Our Business Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows, allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our common and subordinated unitholders and, over time, to increase those quarterly cash distributions. To achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following key business strategies: 

Capitalize on the Growing Demand for Soda Ash. Since 2013, we have invested just over $40 million for de-bottlenecking projects that have improved our production capacity by 236,000 tons per year. We believe that as one of the leading low-cost producers of trona-based soda ash, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the worldwide growth of soda ash. While consumption of soda ash within the United States is expected to remain relatively stable in the near future, overall worldwide demand for soda ash, based on third-party historical production statistics, is projected to grow from an estimated 56.6 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 62.4 million short tons) in 2015 &#32;to almost 70.9 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 78.1 million short tons) in 2021 , which represents a compounded annual growth rate of 3.8% . Through ANSAC and our own exports, as well as our long-standing relationship with domestic customers, we believe that as global demand increases, we will be well positioned to maintain our market share in the principal markets in which we operate by increasing our production through refinements in our production process and without significant additional strategic capital expenditures. 

Increase Operational Efficiencies. &#160; We intend to continue focusing on increasing the efficiency of our operations. Since 2013, we have invested in our operations and improved our competitive position as one of the most cost efficient producers of soda ash in the world. We have identified opportunities to increase our annual production capacity by further streamlining our refining process and implementing certain process efficiencies. 

Maintain Financial Flexibility. We intend to pursue a disciplined financial policy and seek to maintain a conservative capital structure that we believe will provide enhanced stability to our existing cash flows and allow us to consider attractive growth projects and strategic acquisitions in all market environments. See Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt&#8221; for additional information. 

Expand Operations Strategically. In addition to capacity expansions and process improvements at our current facility, we plan to grow our business through various methods as they become available to us, including: (1) organic growth of our existing business by expanding our customer relationships and by making strategic capital expenditures; (2) acquisition of other businesses involved in mining and processing minerals and manufacturing chemicals; (3) acquisition of other soda ash facilities if and when they become available; and (4) acquisition of shipping, logistical or other ancillary businesses to improve our efficiencies and grow our cash flows. However, none of these opportunities may become available to us, we may choose not to pursue any opportunities that are presented to us. 

We can provide no assurance that we will be able to utilize our strengths described above. For further discussion of the risks that we face, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Recent Developments 

Change in Control Transaction . On October 23, 2015, Ciner Enterprises indirectly acquired OCI Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s (&#8220;OCI Enterprises&#8221;) approximately 73% limited partner interest in the Partnership, as well as its 2% general partner interest and related incentive distribution rights (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). Prior to the Transaction, OCI Enterprises indirectly owned and controlled our general partner. The Transaction did not involve the sale or purchase of any of our common units held by the public. As a result of the closing of the Transaction, Ciner Enterprises indirectly owns and controls our general partner, and OCI Enterprises no longer has any direct or indirect ownership or control in the Partnership or our general partner. 

The Transaction resulted in a technical termination of the Partnership and Ciner Wyoming for U.S. federal income tax purposes on October 23, 2015. The technical termination does not affect our consolidated financial statements nor does it affect our classification or Ciner Wyoming&#8217;s classification as a partnership or otherwise affect the nature or extent of our &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our taxable year for all unitholders ended on October 23, 2015 and resulted in a deferral of depreciation deductions that were otherwise allowable in computing the taxable income of our unitholders. This deferral of 

&#32; 

depreciation deductions may result in increased taxable income (or reduced taxable loss) to certain of our unitholders in 2015.We do not expect the deferral of depreciation deductions to have a material adverse impact on our public common unitholders. 

Services Agreement . In connection with the closing of the Transaction, on October 23, 2015 the Partnership entered into a Services Agreement (the &#8220;Services Agreement&#8221;), among the Partnership, our general partner and Ciner Corp. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Ciner Corp has agreed to provide the Partnership with certain corporate, selling, marketing, and general and administrative services, in return for which the Partnership has agreed to pay Ciner Corp an annual management fee, subject to quarterly adjustment, and reimburse Ciner Corp for certain third-party costs incurred in connection with providing such services. For additional information regarding the Services Agreement, please see &#8220;Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Services Agreement&#8221;. 

Indemnification Agreement . Further, in connection with the closing of the Transaction, on October 23, 2015 the Partnership amended and restated in its entirety, and renamed, that certain Omnibus Agreement (the &#8220;Existing Omnibus Agreement&#8221; and as amended and restated, the &#8220;Indemnification Agreement&#8221;), dated September 18, 2013, among the Partnership, our general partner and OCI Enterprises Inc. Pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement, OCI Enterprises has agreed to continue to indemnify the Partnership for issues arising out of, including but not limited to: (i) certain environmental liabilities relating to the period before the Partnership&#8217;s initial public offering, (ii) certain title and rights-of-way matters, (iii) the Partnership&#8217;s failure to have certain necessary governmental consents and permits, (iv) certain tax liabilities relating to the period before the Partnership&#8217;s initial public offering, (v) the use of the name &#8220;OCI&#8221;, and (vi) assets retained by OCI Enterprises and its affiliates. For additional information regarding the Indemnification Agreement, please see &#8220;Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Indemnification Agreement&#8221;. 

Trademark License Agreement . Further, in connection with the closing of the Transaction, on October 23, 2015 the Partnership entered into a Trademark License Agreement (the &#8220;Trademark License Agreement&#8221;), among Park Holding A.S. (&#8220;Park Holding&#8221;), an affiliate of Akkan, Ciner Enterprises, Ciner Corp, Ciner Holding, the Partnership, our general partner, and Ciner Wyoming. The Trademark License Agreement governs the use of &#8220;Ciner&#8221; as part of the names used by the Partnership and the other related parties thereto following the Transaction, and as a trademark and service mark, for the Partnership&#8217;s products and services. For additional information regarding the Trademark License Agreement, please see &#8220;Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Trademark License Agreement&#8221;. 

&#32; 

Our Organizational Structure 

The following chart depicts our ownership structure as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and approximate ownership percentages: 

Our Operations 

Our Green River Basin surface operations are situated on approximately 880 &#32;acres in Wyoming, and our mining operations consist of approximately 23,500 &#32;acres of leased and licensed subsurface mining area. Our facility is accessible by both road and rail. We use six &#32;large continuous mining machines and ten &#32;underground shuttle cars in our mining operations. Our processing assets consist of material sizing units, conveyors, calciners, dissolver circuits, thickener tanks, drum filters, evaporators and rotary dryers. 

&#32; 

The following map provides an aerial overview of our surface operations: 

&#32; 

The following map shows the known sodium leasing area within the Green River Basin, including the boundaries of our leased and licensed subsurface mining area: 

&#32; 

The Green River Basin geological formation holds the largest, and one of the highest purity, known deposits of trona ore in the world. Our reserves contain trona deposits having a purity between 85% &#32;to 89% &#32;by weight, which means that insoluble impurities and water make up approximately 11% &#32;to 15% &#32;of our trona. 

Our mining leases and license are located in two &#32;mining beds, designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as beds 24 &#32;and 25 , at depths of 800 &#32;to 1100 feet, respectively, below the surface. Mining these beds affords us several competitive advantages. First, the depth of our beds is shallower than other actively mined beds in the Green River Basin, which allows us to use a continuous mining technique to mine trona and roof bolt the ceiling simultaneously. In addition, mining two &#32;beds that are on top of one another allows for production efficiencies because we are able to use a single hoisting shaft to service both beds. 

The following graphic shows a cross-section of the strategic areas of the Green River Basin where we mine trona: 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Source: Management. 

We remove insoluble materials and other impurities by thickening and filtering the liquor. We then add activated carbon to our filters to remove organic impurities, which can cause color contamination in the final product. The resulting clear liquid is then crystallized in evaporators, producing sodium carbonate monohydrate. The crystals are then drawn off and passed through a centrifuge to remove excess water. We then dry the resulting material in a product dryer to form anhydrous sodium carbonate, or soda ash. The resulting processed soda ash is then stored in seven on-site storage silos to await shipment by bulk rail or truck to distributors and end customers. Our storage silos can hold up to 65,000 short tons of processed soda ash at any given time. Our facility is in good working condition and has been in service for over 50 years. 

Deca Rehydration. The evaporation stage of our trona ore processing produces a precipitate and natural by-product called deca. &#8220;Deca&#8221;, short for sodium carbonate decahydrate, is one part soda ash and ten parts water. Solar evaporation causes deca to crystallize and precipitate to the bottom of the four main surface ponds at our Green River Basin facility. In 2009 we implemented a process called deca rehydration, which enables us to recover soda ash from the deca-rich purged liquor as a by-product of our refining process. We capture the soda ash contained in deca by allowing the deca crystals to evaporate in the sun and separating the dehydrated crystals from the soda ash. We then blend the separated deca crystals with partially processed trona ore at the dissolving stage of our production process described above. This process enables us to reduce our waste storage needs and convert what is typically a waste product into a usable raw material. Primarily as a result of this process, we have been able to reduce our ore to ash ratio by 5% &#32;over the past five &#32;years. 

Energy Consumption. We believe we have one of the most efficient mining and soda ash production surface operations in the world. In 2015 , we used approximately 3.8 &#32;MMBtus of energy in the form of electricity and natural gas to produce each short ton of soda ash. In addition, we believe this to be the lowest energy consumption of any soda ash producer in North America. We and other producers of soda ash in the Green River Basin benefit from relatively low cost and stable supplies of coal and natural gas in Wyoming, which further enhances our competitive cost advantage over other regions of the world. To reduce the impact of the 

&#32; 

volatility in gas prices, a new hedging program was introduced during 2014 that enables us to fix the price for a portion of our forecasted natural gas purchases. 

Shipping and Logistics. All of our soda ash is shipped by rail or truck from our Green River Basin operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we shipped approximately 96.0% &#32;of our soda ash to our customers initially via a single rail line owned and controlled by Union Pacific Railroad Company (&#8220;Union Pacific&#8221;), and our plant receives rail service exclusively from Union Pacific. Our recently renewed lease agreement with Union Pacific expires on December 31, 2017 . The rail freight rate we are charged under our agreement increases annually based on a published index tied to certain rail industry metrics. If we do not ship a significant portion of our soda ash production on the Union Pacific rail line during a twelve-month period, we must pay Union Pacific a shortfall payment under the terms of our transportation agreement. During 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had no shortfall payments and do not expect such payments in the future. We lease a fleet of more than 2,000 &#32;hopper cars that serve as dedicated modes of shipment to our domestic customers. For export, we ship our soda ash on unit trains consisting of approximately 100 &#32;cars to two primary ports: Port Arthur, Texas and Portland, Oregon. From these ports, our soda ash is loaded onto ships for delivery to ports all over the world. ANSAC provides logistics and support services for all of our export sales. For domestic sales, Ciner Corp provides similar services. 

Customers 

Our largest customer is ANSAC, which buys soda ash from us (through our sales agent) and other of its member companies for further export to its customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , ANSAC accounted for approximately 53.7% &#32;of our net sales. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our net sales. ANSAC takes soda ash orders directly from its overseas customers and then purchases soda ash for resale from its member companies pro rata based on each member&#8217;s allocated volumes. ANSAC is the exclusive distributor for its members to the markets it serves. However, Ciner Corp, on our behalf, negotiates directly with, and we export to, customers in markets not served by ANSAC. We had more than 80 &#32;domestic customers and 15 &#32;foreign customers to whom our agent made sales directly. 

For customers other than ANSAC, our sales agent typically enters into contracts, on our behalf, having terms ranging from one to three years . Under these contracts, our customers generally agree to purchase either minimum estimated volumes of soda ash or a certain percentage of their soda ash requirements. Although we do not have a &#8220;take or pay&#8221; arrangement with our customers, substantially all of our sales are made pursuant to written agreements and not through spot sales. 

Our customers, including end users to whom ANSAC makes sales overseas, consist primarily of: 

&#8226; 

Glass manufacturing companies, which account for 50% or more of the consumption of soda ash around the world; and 

&#8226; 

Chemical and detergent manufacturing companies. 

For accounts in North America, Ciner Corp, on our behalf, typically enters into sales contracts with our customers having terms of one to three years . Pursuant to these contracts, we supply an estimated annual tonnage of soda ash to a customer at a fixed price for a given calendar year. Generally speaking, we have long-term relationships with the majority of our customers, meaning we have been a supplier to them for more than five years. 

Leases and Licenses 

We are party to several mining leases and one license, as noted in the table below, which give us subsurface mining rights. Some of our leases are renewable at our option upon expiration. We pay royalties to the State of Wyoming, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and Rock Springs Royalty Company (&#8220;Rock Springs&#8221;), an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum, which are calculated based upon a percentage of the quantity or gross value of soda ash and related products at a certain stage in the mining process, or a certain sum per each ton of such products. These royalty payments are typically subject to a minimum domestic production volume from our Green River Basin facility, although we are obligated to pay minimum royalties or annual rentals to our lessors and licensor regardless of actual sales. 

The royalty rates we pay to our lessors and licensor may change upon our renewal of such leases and license. Under our license with Rock Springs, the applicable royalty rate may vary based on a most favored nation clause in the license. The applicable royalty rate in the license may be adjusted if we pay a higher royalty rate to certain other mineral rights owners in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The extent to which Rock Springs may increase the applicable royalty rate is currently the subject of litigation in Wyoming. Any increase in the royalty rates we are required to pay to our lessors and licensor, or any failure by us to renew any of our leases and license, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and, therefore, may affect our ability to distribute cash to unitholders.

See Part IV, Item 15 , &#8220; Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules&#8212; Exhibit Index &#8221; for more information. 

Trona Reserves 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 267.5 million &#32;short tons, which is equivalent to 145.8 million &#32;short tons of soda ash. The estimates of our proven and probable reserves were prepared by the Ciner Resources staff. Our mine engineers were responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Based on a projected mining rate of 4.0 million &#32;short tons of trona per year, we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona for approximately 67 years. 

The Ciner Resources staff calculated a mineral reserve estimate on our trona mineral assets, which are contained in beds 24 and 25 of the Green River Basin, at depths of 800 and 1100 feet below the surface, respectively. The Ciner Resources staff estimates are based on geological data generated from historical exploration drill holes, borings within the mine space, and mine observations and measurements, including core samples. In addition, the Ciner Resources staff reviewed and analyzed our reserve base maps and current mining plans, and developed a life of mine plan with respect to the predicted life of our reserves using a non-subsidence design. 

Our trona reserve estimates include reserves that can be economically and legally extracted and processed into soda ash at the time of their determination. Our trona reserves are categorized as &#8220;proven (measured) reserves&#8221; and &#8220;probable (indicated) reserves,&#8221; which are defined as follows: 

&#8226; 

Proven (Measured) Reserves &#8212;Reserves for which: (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established. 

&#8226; 

Probable (Indicated) Reserves &#8212;Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. 

For purposes of categorizing our proven reserves, the Ciner Resources staff estimates applied exploration and mine measurements and drill hole data within a one-quarter mile radius, and required at least 8-feet of trona thickness and a trona ore grade of at least 85% &#32;(with 15% of clays, shales and other impurities). For purposes of categorizing our probable reserves, the Ciner Resources staff estimates applied exploration and mine measurements and drill hole data within a three-quarter mile radius, and required at least 8-feet of trona thickness and a trona ore grade of at least 85% (with 15% of clays, shales and other impurities). To assess the economic viability of our reserves, the Ciner Resources staff reviewed our cost of products sold and average sales price of soda ash for the three years ended December 31, 2015 . 

In determining whether our reserves meet these proven and probable standards, the Ciner Resources staff applied certain assumptions regarding the remaining life of our reserves, including, among other things, that: 

&#32; 

&#8226; 

our cost of products sold per short ton will remain consistent with our cost of products sold for the three years ended December 31, 2015 , which was approximately $80 &#32;per short ton of soda ash; 

&#8226; 

the average CIF (carriage, insurance, and freight) sales price will remain consistent with our historical average CIF sales price for the three years ended December 31, 2015 , which was approximately $181 &#32;per short ton of soda ash; 

&#8226; 

we will achieve an annual mining rate of approximately 4.0 million &#32;short tons of trona; 

&#8226; 

we will process soda ash with a 90% &#32;recovery rate without accounting for our deca rehydration process; 

&#8226; 

the ore to ash ratio for the stated trona reserves is 1.835:1.0 &#32;(short tons of trona run-of-mine to short tons of soda ash); 

&#8226; 

our run-of-mine ore estimate contains dilution from the mining process; 

&#8226; 

we will, in approximately 30-40 years, make necessary equipment modifications to operate at a seam height of 7-feet, although our current mining limit is 9 &#32;to 10 feet; 

&#8226; 

we will, within the next four &#32;to nine &#32;years, conduct &#8220;two-seam mining,&#8221; which means to perform continuous mining simultaneously on beds 24 and 25 in close proximity; 

&#8226; 

our mining costs will remain consistent with 2015 &#32;levels; 

&#8226; 

our processing costs will remain consistent with 2015 &#32;levels; 

&#8226; 

we will continue to conduct only conventional mining using the room and pillar method and a non-subsidence mine design; 

&#8226; 

we have and will continue to have valid leases and licenses in place with respect to the reserves, and that these leases and licenses can be renewed for the life of the mine based on our extensive history of renewing leases and licenses; 

&#8226; 

we have and will continue to have the necessary permits to conduct mining operations with respect to the reserves; and 

&#8226; 

we will maintain the necessary tailings storage capacity to maintain tailings disposal between the mine and surface placement for the life-of-mine. 

Our reserves are subject to leases with the State of Wyoming and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and a license with Rock Springs. See &#8220;Leases and Licenses&#8221; above for a summary of these leases and our license, including expiration date ranges.

Our reserve estimates will change from time to time as a result of mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geologic data, modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors. For addition information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, &#8220;Risks Inherent in Our Business and Industry&#8221; for more information regarding risks surrounding our reserves. 

Competition 

Soda ash is a commodity chemical traded globally with numerous producers and consumers worldwide. We compete with both North American and international soda ash producers. There are two ways to consider how we compete: (1) versus our fellow North American competitors; and (2) versus our worldwide competitors. Against our principal North American competitors, which include subsidiaries of Tronox, Solvay and Tata in the Green River Basin and Searles Valley Minerals in California, we believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including operational advantages that improve our relative cost position, life of our mineral reserves, our strong safety record, customer relationships and an experienced management team and workforce. Against our principal worldwide competitors, Solvay, Tata and Nirma Group, virtually all of their production is manufactured from synthetic processes and we believe, as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have competitive advantages, even after considering the fact that we generally have higher logistics costs to move the soda ash from Wyoming to regions around the world. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona. In addition, we believe trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. See &#8220;Our Competitive Strengths&#8221; above for additional information. 

Insurance 

Because all of our operations are conducted at a single facility, an event such as an explosion, fire, equipment malfunction or severe weather conditions could significantly disrupt our trona mining or soda ash production operations and our ability to supply soda ash to our customers. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of our surface and subsurface operations. To mitigate this risk, Ciner Enterprises or its affiliates maintains, on our behalf, property, casualty and business interruption insurance in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are adequate for our current operations. We continually evaluate our policy limits and deductibles as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance coverage to account for changes or growth in our business. 

Environmental Matters 

Our mining and processing operations, which have been conducted at our Green River Basin facility for many years, are subject to strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to protection of the environment. We have a rigorous compliance program to ensure that our facilities comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters. Modifications or changes in enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations in the future, particularly with respect to environmental or climate change, or changes in the operation of our business or the discovery of additional or unknown environmental contamination, could require expenditures which might be material to our results of operations or financial conditions. 

We summarize below certain environmental laws applicable to us that regulate discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the protection of groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, and climate change. Our failure to comply with any of the below laws may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. 

Clean Air Act 

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources. Under the Clean Air Act, our facility has been issued a Title V operating permit, which regulates emissions to air from our operations. In particular, our operations are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act&#8217;s New Source Performance Standards for Nonmetallic Mineral Processing Plants, which limit particulate matter emissions. Under associated clean air act regulations this operation is also subject to Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements. In addition, our boilers are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act&#8217;s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Source: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, which were published in final form in January 2013. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. 

Clean Water Act 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which we refer to as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the federal EPA or the state. We do not discharge any 

&#32; 

wastewater from our operations into the Green River, the nearest river system to our Green River Basin facility. However, the discharge of storm water runoff from our facility is governed by a general permit issued by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. In particular, the general permit requires our compliance with a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. We periodically monitor groundwater wells at our processing facility, most of which are proximate to our surface pond complex, for salinity, conductivity and other parameters pursuant to permits issued by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. Permitted interceptor trenches are used to collect saline groundwater to prevent discharge and impact to the Green River. 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 

The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws, impose requirements for the careful generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. Based on the amount of hazardous waste our operations generate (less than 100 kilograms per month), we have been classified under RCRA as a conditionally exempt generator. 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, (otherwise known as &#8220;Superfund&#8221;) and comparable state laws impose liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and those who disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Wyoming&#8217;s Environmental Quality Act also creates the potential for liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment, and has been construed to impose liability without regard to fault. We have not received notice that we are a potentially responsible party at any Superfund site. 

Climate Change Legislation and Regulations 

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources, including soda ash processors like us. We are monitoring and reporting GHG emissions from our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with the rules. Under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality, or PSD, permitting regulations, this operation will be subject to BACT requirements if PSD thresholds are exceeded. In the past, the U.S. Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation that would impose requirements to reduce emissions of GHGs. The State of California recently enacted regulations establishing a so-called GHG &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; system designed to reduce GHG emissions. Our operations are not currently subject to any federal or state requirement to reduce GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations limiting, or otherwise imposing a tax or financial penalty for, emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations might be material to our results of operations or financial conditions. 

Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality&#8212;Land Quality Division 

Our operations are subject to oversight by the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. In particular, our principal mine permit issued by the Land Quality Division requires us to &#8220;self-bond&#8221; for the estimated future cost to reclaim the area of our processing facility, surface pond complex and on-site sanitary landfill. As of December 31, 2015 , the amount of the self-bond was $33.9 million . The amount of the bond is subject to change based upon periodic re-evaluation by the Land Quality Division. 

Mining and Workplace Safety 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, is the primary regulatory organization governing safety matters associated with trona ore mining. Accordingly, MSHA regulates underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with trona ore mines. MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and enforces compliance with that statute&#8217;s mandatory safety and health standards. As part of MSHA&#8217;s oversight, representatives perform at least four unannounced inspections (quarterly) annually for our entire facility. To date these inspections have not resulted in any citations for major violations of MSHA&#8217;s Code of Federal Regulations. 

We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. 

&#32; 

Our Green River Basin facility maintains a rigorous safety program. Ciner Corp and its affiliates&#8217; employees and contractors who operate our assets are required to complete 40 hours of initial training, as well as eight-hour annual refresher sessions. These training programs cover all of the potential site-specific hazards present at the facility. As a direct result of our commitment to safety, the Green River Basin facility has had an exceptional safety record in recent years. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our facility had no &#32;lost work day injuries and thre e recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. Over the five years ended December 31, 2015 , the Green River Basin facility averaged 1.6 &#32;lost work day injuries per year and averaged 5.6 &#32;recordable injuries per year as reported by MSHA, which we believe to be better than the industry average. 

Employees/Labor Relations 

Prior to the Transaction, the personnel who operated our assets were employees of OCI Enterprises and its affiliates, and, under the Omnibus Agreement, we reimbursed OCI Enterprises and its affiliates for the expenses incurred by them in providing services to us, and we also reimbursed OCI Enterprises for certain direct operating expenses they paid on our behalf. Subsequent to the consummation of the Transaction on October 23, 2015, the personnel who operate our assets are employees of Ciner Corp and its affiliates. 

Under the joint venture agreement governing Ciner Wyoming, Ciner Wyoming reimburses us for employees who operate our assets and for support provided to Ciner Wyoming. As of December 31, 2015 , Ciner Corp and its affiliates had approximately 476 &#32;full-time employees, of which 430 &#32;are employees that operate the mine at our facility in the Green River Basin. None of these employees was covered by a collective bargaining agreement as of December 31, 2015 , and we did not experience any labor strikes or other significant labor problems during 2015 . 

In addition, under to the Services Agreement, Ciner Corp has agreed to provide the Partnership with certain corporate, selling, marketing, and general and administrative services, in return for which the Partnership has agreed to pay Ciner Corp an annual management fee and reimburse Ciner Corp for certain third-party costs incurred in connection with providing such services. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

&#32; We qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to: 

&#8226; &#32;provide an auditor&#8217;s attestation report on management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 

&#8226; 

present more than two years of audited financial statements, selected financial data and related Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Report; 

&#8226; 

comply with certain new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB; 

&#8226; 

&#32;comply with certain new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise; 

&#8226; 

&#32;provide disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or 

&#8226; 

&#32;obtain unitholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

We will cease to be an emerging growth company when any of the following conditions apply: 

&#8226; 

&#32;we have $1.0 billion or more in annual revenues; 

&#8226; 

&#32;at least $700 million in market value of our common units are held by non-affiliates; 

&#8226; 

&#32;we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or 

&#8226; 

&#32;the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering has passed. 

In addition, an emerging growth company can delay its adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have made the irrevocable election to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which non-emerging growth companies must adopt such standards.
