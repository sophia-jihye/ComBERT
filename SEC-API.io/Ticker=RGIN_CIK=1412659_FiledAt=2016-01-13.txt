 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

A year and half after filing the lawsuit against Lonza Walkersville, Inc., and Lonza America, Inc. (the &#8220;Lonza Litigation&#8221;), we began the new 2015 fiscal year in the process of consummating an agreement to sell certain assets, including the Lonza Litigation, to Amarantus Bioscience Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Amarantus Agreement&#8221;). The Amarantus Agreement was finally consummated at the end of February 2015, with their final payment to us and the transfer/dismissal of the Lonza Litigation. Managements' intentions at the time were to utilize the proceeds of the Amarantus Agreement to develop the Company's own autologous Engineered Skin Substitute (ESS). It was estimated that the proceeds from the sale of the Lonza Litigation, including the Amarantus stock received, would fund the development of the new product up to the initiation of clinical trials, while at the same time reducing outstanding liabilities and supporting the business operations of the Company. Unfortunately, due to a decline in the value of the Amarantus stock, management has determined at this time that the proceeds will fall short of that goal and that further funding will most likely need to be raised. 

At the start of 2015, we reached an agreement with an internationally recognized institution to provide analytical R&#38;D services for the proposed new product. This was a necessary step in the process of validating the science supporting our new approach. We believe their research has thus far not only provided support for our new science, but has also brought us product improvements in the form of the best starting materials, an extended shelf life, and potentially reducing the manufacturing time of the product. Upon completion, we expect this research will be part of our application for FDA approval to start clinical trials, and will provide the basis of the tech transfer to our chosen manufacturers. 

NovaDerm&#8482; was selected as the name for the proposed new product and documents were completed to register the name as a new Regenicin trademark. We expect NovaDerm&#8482; will be registered trademark during the first quarter of 2016. As reported, the tradename PermaDerm&#174; was transferred to Amarantus as part of that agreement. 

&#160; 

We submitted a &#34;Request for Designation&#34; to the FDA to determine which group within the agency would be assigned to evaluate NovaDerm&#8482;. The FDA responded in a phone conversation with our CEO and staff that the product would be designated solely as a &#34;Biologic&#34;. NovaDerm&#8482; would thus be the first and only autologous cultured skin substitute designated solely as a Biologic for treatment of burns greater than 30%, which not only serves as a point of product differentiation, but will also open up the opportunity for NovaDerm&#8482; to apply for Orphan Designation, with all available benefits. 

The most significant hurdle in the product development process to overcome, we believe, is the collagen substrate issue. Collagen is used in many products, but it is the essential ingredient to fabricate scaffolds on which cells are grown. Type 1 Bovine Collagen is harvested from corium, which is the lower part of the Dermis layer of the cow hide. The FDA regulations and guidance dictates any animal part used in treatment of humans must be from a &#34;Closed Herd&#34;. In our search for Closed Herd collagen, we found that most of the suppliers' claiming to sell from a &#8220;Closed Herd&#34; were not in fact compliant with the FDA regulations and lacked the traceability required for animal materials used for drugs, devices, biologics or combination products. It was important to our analysis of this issue that the FDA guidance documents clearly state that any product being requested for clinical trials would be denied until the applicant supplied the traceability to demonstrate that all components derived from animals were obtained from &#8220;Closed Herds&#8221;. We identified only one company that was able to satisfy the FDA's Closed Herd requirements. Negotiations are ongoing regarding obtaining collagen supplies from this company, and as a result of the importance of this material to our proposed new product, both Regenicin and members of management expect to enter into an arrangement to become part owners of this vertical supply business. 

There are two separate manufacturing processes that must be performed to produce NovaDerm&#8482;. First, the collagen scaffold must be fabricated to act as the platform on which to grow the skin cells. Secondly, the patient&#8217;s actual cells must be cultured and organized to make the skin. 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Both are highly specialized manufacturing processes and must be performed under strict compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) as set forth by regulations enforced by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and produced by a manufacturer registered with the FDA. After much discussion, we have identified two highly respected, recognized, domestic cGMP manufacturers that can provide cultured skin substitute materials for clinical trials, and which we anticipate eventually contracting with for the manufacture of NovaDerm&#8482; when, and if, it is approved for commerce. 

The Pre-IND (investigational new drug) package for the FDA is substantially complete and must await the final results from the analytical R&#38;D services report mentioned above. Once completed, we will request a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA. The Pre-IND meeting will give us the opportunity to ask any questions we may have for the FDA as well as getting feedback from the FDA on the information we provide about NovaDerm&#8482;. The meeting will also let us know if the FDA agrees with our plan of commercialization, or if additional information will be needed for the IND. In order to save time we have already completed much of the IND that will request permission to start clinical trials. 

We also expect to continue our discussions with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA) related to a grant application for NovaDerm&#8482; product development. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Our Proposed New Product: 

We expect our first cultured skin substitute product, NovaDerm&#8482;, to be a multi-layered tissue-engineered skin prepared by utilizing autologous (patient&#8217;s own) skin cells. It is expected to be a graftable collagen based cultured epithelium implant that produces a skin substitute containing both epidermal and dermal components with a collagen base. Clinically, we expect our cultured skin substitute self-to-self skin graft product will behave the same as split thickness allograft skin. Our Autologous cultured skin substitute should not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike with porcine or cadaver cellular grafts. Immune system rejection is a serious concern in Xeno-transplant procedures which may have a cellular component. The use of our cultured skin substitute should not require any specialized physician training because it is applied the same as in a standard allograft procedure. 

Clinically speaking, a product designed to treat a life threatening condition must be available for the patient when needed. Our culture skin substitute is being developed to be ready to apply to the patient when the patient is ready for grafting, within the first month of the patient being admitted to the hospital. Patients with serious burn injuries may not be in a condition to be grafted on a predefined schedule made more than a month in advance. Therefore, in order to accommodate the patient&#8217;s needs, we are striving to ensure that our cultured skin substitute will be designed with an adequate shelf life and manufacturing schedule to ensure it is available whether the patient needs it the first month, or any day after, until the patient&#8217;s wound is completely covered and closed. 

We intend to work with the FDA for the development of a cultured skin product. We are preparing documentation for Orphan Designation for the USA and European Union using our internal expertise. We will submit the request when we have qualified our cell therapy manufacturer. In order to obtain Orphan designation we will work with the Office of Orphan products to demonstrate that our cultured skin substitute is safe and the probable benefit of using our cultured skin substitute for burns outweighs the risks. There are less than 200,000 patients affected per year in the US with full thickness burns affecting greater than 30 percent of the Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). As noted above, we hope to obtain Orphan Designation for burns in the first half of 2016. 

Having our cultured skin substitute approved as an Orphan Product would have significant benefits, including 7 years exclusivity with the FDA, 11 years exclusivity with the European Union generating revenue from sales of product used during the clinical trials and being able to utilize the data from patients from many different hospitals to gain Commercialization Approval. Orphan approval allows the product to be used to treat people a lot earlier than waiting for extensive clinical trials to gain Biological License Approval. The major difference between Orphan Product Approval and a full Biological License Approval is that the Orphan Product has additional FDA reporting requirements and additional procedural administration steps. Orphan Product patient&#8217;s data must be reported to the FDA annually. There is also a difference between Orphan Designation and Orphan Product Approval. Orphan Designation qualifies your product to get special assistance from the FDA such as grants, and additional guidance in designing your trials and what the FDA expects you to do to gain Orphan Approval. Orphan Approval is granted when you have demonstrated that your product is safe and has a probable benefit to a patient affected with the specific indication. Most importantly for us, Orphan Approval means we can provide our lifesaving product NovaDerm&#8482; commercially to thousands of pediatric and adult burn victims. 

We are assembling our Investigative New Drug (IND) Biologic application for our cultured skin substitute utilizing our internal expertise. This will allow us to move the product through the FDA pipeline with minimal expense. As we approach the clinical trials, we may need to obtain additional outside funding. We hope to receive the approval from the FDA to initiate clinical trials in 2015. We intend to apply for Biological License Approval in 2016. 

Our second product is anticipated to be TempaDerm&#174;. TempaDerm&#174; uses cells obtained from human donors to develop banks of cryo-preserved (frozen) cells and cultured skin substitute to provide a continuous supply of non-allogenic skin substitutes to treat much smaller wound areas on patients, such as ulcers. This product is expected to have applications in the treatment of chronic skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. This product is also expected to be similar to our burn indication product, except for the indications, and it will not depend totally on autologous cells. In fact, it may be possible to use the excess cultured skin that was originally produced for use on the patient that donated the cells used to grow the skin. Hopefully, TempaDerm&#174; will be able to take this original cultured skin and use it on someone other than the original donor. As currently planned, TempaDerm&#174; has the possibility of using banked cells, or even frozen cultured skin substitutes, to carry inventory to satisfy unknown needs or large volumes to meet the demands created in large scale disasters. 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

We believe this technology has many different uses beyond the burn indication. The other uses may include chronic wounds, reconstructive surgery, other complex organs and tissues. Some of the individual components of our planned cultured skin substitute technology is expected to be developed for devices, such as tendon wraps made of collagen or collagen temporary coverings of large area wounds to protect the patients from infections while waiting for the permanent skin substitute. The collagen technology used for cultured skin substitutes, as designed, is expected to be used for many different applications in wound healing and stem cell technology and even drug delivery systems. 

We could pursue any or all of the indications simultaneously if financing permitted, but for now we will seek approval for burns first as an Orphan Biologic Product to establish significant safety data and then Biological License Approval. 

Competition &#160; 

&#160; 

Several companies have developed or are developing products that propose to approach the markets described above. Other than Amarantus Biosciences, Inc., discussed above, this companies include: 

&#160; 

- Smith &#38; Nephew Wound Management 

- Genzyme Biosurgery 

- Integra Life Sciences Corporation 

- LifeCell Corporation/Kinetic Concepts 

- Organogenesis Inc 

- Intercytex 

- Genzyme 

- Advanced Biohealing/ Shire 

- Cy Ttera/ NovoCell/ViaCyte 

- Biomimetic Therapeutics Inc. 

- RTI Biologics 

&#160; 

Each of these companies has a proprietary approach to these markets, but none has yet penetrated the cell therapy markets fully and 4 companies, (Smith and Nephew, Genzyme, Organogenesis, Integra and Advanced Biohealing) have products that are FDA approved for use in burn patients. Conversely, our products are believed to be superior in design and function and, thus, provide significant advantages over the above competitors. The advantages of our cultured skin substitute include simultaneous delivery of Autologus epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts organized with a unique collagen base. Clinical skin replacements and grafts are in high demand for the treatment of skin injuries: they represent approximately 50% of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine market revenues. In 2009, the potential United States market for tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes totaled approximately $18.9 billion, based on a target patient population of approximately 5.0 million. By the year 2019, the total potential target population for the use of tissue-engineered skin replacements and substitutes is expected to increase to 6.4 million, resulting in a potential US market of approximately $24.3 billion.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-85) provides that Orphan Product applications for pediatric use only, or for use in both pediatric and adult patients, that are approved on or after September 27, 2007, are assigned an annual distribution number (ADN) and may be sold for profit (subject to the upper limit of the ADN). In addition, once a product receives an Orphan BLA, the developer of the product receives up to seven years market exclusivity for a specific indication following the product&#8217;s approval by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Unrestricted sales of our cultured skin substitute will require full approval after data for safety and efficacy are collected from a multi-center study. Once the IND is submitted, we expect enrollment and treatment are expected to require one year evaluation on each patient. The final 9 months of the evaluation is expected to be only a monitoring period. After collection of data from the clinical trial and submission to FDA, six months is typically planned for FDA&#8217;s review and decision. Having an Orphan designation of which the indication is life threatening and there is an unmet need for catastrophic burns, the review time may be reduced significantly. Therefore, we believe Biological approval can be obtained in 2016 or 2017. A positive performance of the clinical study and a review from FDA in less than 6 months after pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facility by FDA would support a 2016-17 date for commercial sales.

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

In August 2010, we paid $7,500 and obtained the rights to the trademarks PermaDerm&#174; and TempaDerm&#174; from KJR-10 Corp. In November of 2014, we sold the PermaDerm&#174; trademark to Amarantus Biosciences as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby they purchase all our rights to the Lonza lawsuit. Recently, we filed for the trademark for NovaDerm&#8482;. We expect the NovaDerm&#8482; trademark will be registered the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2015, we had 3 employees. 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

On September 11, 2013 we completed formation documents with respect to the formation of a wholly - owned subsidiary created with the sole purpose of conducting research in the State of Georgia. 

&#160; 

The subsidiary was given the name, Regenicin Research of Georgia, LLC, and was accepted by the Georgia Secretary of State on September 25, 2013, with an official certificate of formation being issued on September 26, 2013.
