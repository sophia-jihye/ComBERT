 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

BMB Munai, Inc. (&#8220;BMBM&#8221;) is a Nevada corporation that originally incorporated in the State of Utah in 1981. From 2003 to 2011, BMBM&#8217;s business activities focused on oil and natural gas exploration and production in the Republic of Kazakhstan through its then wholly-owned subsidiary Emir Oil LLP (&#8220;Emir Oil&#8221;). In September 2011, BMBM sold all of its interest in Emir Oil, including its right, title, and interest in and to the oil and gas licenses and licensed territory owned by Emir Oil, to an independent third party for cash of about $170 million. The proceeds of the sale were used to, among other things, repay outstanding obligations, satisfy certain post-closing undertakings, meet ongoing expenses, and make two separate cash distributions totaling approximately $74,750,000 to its stockholders. 

Since the sale of its oil and gas operations and assets in September 2011, BMBM has investigated possibly acquiring other assets and operations to provide potential value to its stockholders. On November 23, 2015, BMBM entered into a Share Exchange and Acquisition Agreement with Timur Turlov (the &#8220;Acquisition Agreement&#8221;) with the intent to build an international, broadly based brokerage and financial service firm to meet the growing demand from an increasing number of investors in Russia and Kazakhstan for access to the financial opportunities, relative stability, and comprehensive regulatory reputation of the U.S. securities markets. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, BMBM acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FFIN Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;FFIN&#8221;) from Mr. Turlov in exchange for 224,551,913 shares of BMBM common stock, which constituted approximately 80.1% of BMBM&#8217;s outstanding common stock after giving effect to the transaction. 

The Acquisition Agreement also provides, subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, for the possible acquisition by the Company of Mr. Turlov&#8217;s 100% equity interests in Investment Company Freedom Finance LLC, a Russian limited company (&#8220;Freedom RU&#8221;), and the securities brokerage and financial services business conducted by it in Russia, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Freedom Finance JSC, a Kazakhstan joint stock company (&#8220;Freedom KZ&#8221;), and the securities brokerage and financial services business conducted by it in Kazakhstan, and FFINEU Investments Limited, a Cyprus limited company (&#8220;Freedom CY&#8221;) and the securities brokerage and financial services business conducted by Freedom CY. Freedom RU, Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY and the securities brokerage and investment services businesses conducted by each of them, in each case, are collectively referred to herein as the &#8220;Freedom Companies&#8221; unless otherwise specifically indicated or as is otherwise contextually required. 

Our Business 

We believe the Freedom Companies serve an emerging capitalistic and investing segment of the economies of Russia and Kazakhstan that is interested in saving, investing, and diversifying risk through foreign investment. Under the existing regulatory regimes in Russia and Kazakhstan, Freedom RU and Freedom KZ are limited in their ability to grant their customers access to the U.S. securities markets. 

Mr. Turlov is seeking a more sustainable, long-term strategy to allow his customer base in Russia and Kazakhstan to participate in the U.S. markets because of what he perceives to be the growing disfavor of omnibus clearing accounts for foreign financial institutions among regulators and U.S. financial institutions as well as customer concerns that the Freedom Companies expose them to attendant political, regulatory, currency, banking, and economic risks and uncertainties in their respective countries of operation. To meet this perceived need, Mr. Turlov organized FFIN in August 2014 to serve primarily foreign clients referred from Freedom RU and Freedom KZ as part of a strategy to provide foreign customers with access to the U.S. securities markets within a single vertically integrated financial services firm. 

In December 2015, FFIN applied to become a member of FINRA and a licensed securities broker-dealer with the SEC. FFIN recently withdrew its applications to provide itself additional time to collect information requested by FINRA and to assess whether to reapply for licensure. If FFIN determines to reapply for broker-dealer registration, we anticipate it would do so before the end of calendar 2016. In addition to FINRA membership and SEC licensure, if granted, FFIN would also be required to comply with the state securities licensure requirements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We continue to work toward successful completion of the acquisition of Freedom RU, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY. The acquisitions of Freedom RU and Freedom CY are separate transactions that are not interdependent, so we may acquire either, both, or none of such companies. 

The completion of the acquisition of Freedom RU and Freedom CY is dependent on the express conditions that: 

(i) the particular Freedom Company to be acquired completes and provides to us audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP and GAAS, so that we can include such audited financial statements in our periodic reports filed with the SEC; 

(ii) the particular Freedom Company to be acquired has received all required governmental and regulatory approvals for the change of ownership from its current ownership to us; and 

(iii) if, at the time of the proposed closing, we do not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares to issue the number of shares as we agreed in the Acquisition Agreement, we will effect a recapitalization consisting of: (i) a reverse split of our outstanding common stock in such amount as our board of directors may determine; and (ii) a potential increase in the number of our authorized common stock in such amount as our board may determine. 

Completion of each acquisition is also conditioned on the continuing accuracy of the representations and warranties of the respective parties to the Acquisition Agreement, and the satisfaction of certain conditions and other covenants, many of which may be waived by either party. 

We may abandon the acquisition of either Freedom RU or Freedom CY if it is not completed by December 31, 2016. If we do not complete either of such acquisitions, we may nevertheless execute securities transactions of the customers of such Freedom Companies not acquired under introducing, execution, clearing, and settlement arrangements common in the securities industry and at competitive rates if FFIN determines to reapply and is approved to become a U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and satisfies applicable regulatory requirements. The Acquisition Agreement does not grant to us any right or remedy to rescind our acquisition of FFIN if we do not complete the acquisition of the Freedom Companies because of their failure to provide required audited financial statements or meet other pre-closing conditions. 

Recapitalization 

We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock and have approximately 280.3 million shares outstanding. Under the Acquisition Agreement, we are obligated to issue sufficient shares to Mr. Turlov such that following the acquisitions of Freedom RU and Freedom CY, Mr. Turlov will own approximately 95% of the issued and outstanding common stock of BMBM, which together with our currently outstanding stock, would exceed our authorized common stock. Therefore, if we do not have a sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares to issue the number of shares required under the Acquisition Agreement before the acquisition of either Freedom RU or Freedom CY, we have agreed to recapitalize BMBM by effecting a reverse split of our common stock and possibly a change in our authorized common stock to such number of shares of common stock as our board of directors determines. After such reverse-split, the number of shares that we are obligated to issue to complete the proposed acquisitions will be appropriately reduced. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

After giving effect to the acquisition of all of the Freedom Companies, which then would become our wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries, Mr. Turlov will own approximately 95% of our post-reverse-split shares then issued and outstanding. 

The Freedom Companies 

Since the organization of Freedom RU in 2010 and the acquisition of Freedom KZ in 2013, they have serviced a growing customer base with increasing amounts invested. As of March 31, 2016, Freedom RU and Freedom KZ together had approximately 30,000 total active customer accounts, with aggregate investment positions of more than $100 million. The customers of the Freedom Companies typically execute approximately 15,000 transactions per month, with an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1 billion. The customers of Freedom RU and Freedom KZ range from retail traders that frequently execute large transactions to relatively small, inactive accounts that hold securities positions long-term. In the preceding year, approximately 80% or more of the aggregate trading dollar volume was generated by about two dozen margin day traders. The Freedom Companies&#8217; customers principally invest in exchange-traded securities. 

For the year ended March 31, 2016, Freedom RU and its subsidiary Freedom KZ together had consolidated profits of approximately $11.3 million on revenues of about $14.4 million (unaudited, subject to adjustment). As of March 31, 2016, the consolidated total assets of the Freedom Companies were approximately $40.1 million. Collectively, Freedom RU and Freedom KZ together employ 17 executive and supervisory employees, 44 administrative and clerical employees, and 75 persons serving as customer representatives. 

We believe that the customers of Freedom RU and Freedom KZ, view the United States as an attractive, economically sound, financially stable, and well-regulated securities market in which to invest. The recent strength of the U.S. dollar (&#8220;dollar&#8221;) as compared to the Russian ruble and Kazakh tenge, both of which have fluctuated widely and declined in value substantially relative to the dollar in recent years, appears to have heightened this interest, even though this currency exchange rate trend effectively reduced the amounts these customers are able to invest in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. 

Freedom RU 

Freedom RU was organized in 2010 and provides financial services in the Russian Federation in accordance with the Russian government&#8217;s open-ended licenses for brokerage, dealer, and depository operations and for activities in securities management. The Federal Financial Markets Service of Russia provides the governmental regulation of company operations and the protection of the interests of its customers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Freedom KZ 

Freedom KZ was acquired by Mr. Turlov in 2013 from unrelated parties. When Mr. Turlov acquired Freedom KZ, it was controlled by Korean nationals and principally facilitated Korean investment in Kazakhstan. It was not profitable. Freedom KZ provides professional services in the capital markets. Since 2006, Freedom KZ has been a professional participant of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, which enables it to manage investment portfolios for its clients. Freedom KZ is regulated by the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 

Freedom CY 

Freedom CY was organized in August 2013, completed its regulatory licensing in May 2015, and is in the process of initiating activities pursuant to this license. Freedom CY will provide transaction handling and intermediary services to Freedom RU and Freedom KZ and is regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. Until Freedom CY initiates activities pursuant to its regulatory licensing and begins operations, transaction intermediary services will continue to be provided to Freedom RU and Freedom KZ through another Cyprus entity owned by Mr. Turlov pursuant to an interim informal licensing exemption. 

Customer Base and Marketing Plan 

If we complete the acquisitions of the Freedom Companies and FFIN determines to reapply and is successful in becoming a registered securities broker-dealer in the U.S., we will focus our marketing efforts on offering and providing international customers with access to the stability and long-term growth opportunities offered by the U.S. investment markets, as well as the regulatory protections that extend to customers of U.S. broker-dealers, including security of customer funds. Our primary source of customer business will be the existing and expanding client base of the Freedom Companies. We anticipate that these customers will be a mix of individual retail customers, including family or small business entities owned and controlled by individuals, family asset planning or holding companies, and private equity funds. 

Outside of the business from the Freedom Companies, if FFIN determines to reapply and is successful in becoming a licensed securities broker-dealer in the U.S., it may market or advertise its services in the U.S., but FFIN has not determined the scope or direction of that effort. 

As our volume of customer order execution expands, we may develop and offer additional services and products, subject to applicable regulatory requirements. 

Competition 

Since the base of our customers will be retail investors in Russia and Kazakhstan, our principal competitors will be in those countries, each of which has a vigorous and aggressive competitive investment and securities markets. There are both local and large financial services firms that offer an array of financial products and services in these countries. The financial service firms with which we compete for customers in Russia include JSC Brokerage House Otkrytiye, LLC Company BrokerCreditService, LLC KIT Finance, and FINAM Group and in Kazakhstan include JSC Halyk Finance, JSC Assyl Invest, and JSC Centras Securities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe competition will be based principally on our ability to provide access directly to the U.S. securities markets, the level of our service, the convenience of our services, our ability to provide personalized service, and our charges to customers. Customer costs include transaction execution fees, commissions and charges as well as margin interest rates the Freedom Companies charge their customers investing on margin. 

Many of the firms with which we will compete are larger, provide more diversified services and products, provide access to more international markets, and have greater management, technical, and financial resources. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively. 

Regulation 

Overview 

Our proposed business and the securities industry in general are subject to extensive regulation in the United States at both the federal and state level, as well as by industry self-regulatory organizations (&#8220;SROs&#8221;). Our business and our customers will also be subject to regulation by various foreign governments and regulatory bodies. 

In the United States, a number of federal and industry regulatory agencies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. The SEC is the federal agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation of broker-dealers doing business in the United States. Industry SROs, each of which has authority over the firms that are its members, include FINRA, national securities exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange on which securities are traded, the Depository Trust Corporation, commonly referred to as DTC, to facilitate transaction clearing, and other SROs. Broker-dealers are also subject to registration and regulation by state securities laws administered by regulators in those states in which such broker-dealers conduct business, which generally covers the states in which their customers reside. 

In December 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary FFIN applied for membership in FINRA and for registration as a broker-dealer with the SEC. FFIN, however, recently withdrew its applications to provide itself additional time to address FINRA questions. FFIN is currently assessing whether to submit a new application to become a member of FINRA. If FFIN elects to reapply, we anticipate it will do so before the end of calendar 2016. If FFIN elects to reapply and is successful, it will also plan to apply for registration as a broker-dealer in the state of Utah, where its principal U.S. offices are located. 

If FFIN elects to reapply, and if and when FFIN completes federal and state registration and FINRA membership, it will have overlapping schemes of regulation that will cover all aspects of its securities business. These regulations cover a broad range of matters, including: 

&#9679; 

capital requirements; 

&#9679; 

the use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities; 

&#9679; 

recordkeeping and reporting requirements; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

customer identity, clearance, and monitoring to identify and prevent money laundering; 

&#9679; 

supervisory and organizational procedures intended to monitor and assure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading practices; 

&#9679; 

employee-related matters, including qualification and licensing of supervisory, sales, and operations personnel; 

&#9679; 

transaction execution, clearance, and settlement procedures; and 

&#9679; 

rules of FINRA designed to promote high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. 

Applicable regulations address specific details concerning the relationship between broker-dealers and their customers. As a result, many aspects of the broker-dealer customer relationship are subject to regulation, including customer anti-money laundering monitoring and reporting, a firm&#8217;s &#8220;know your customer&#8221; requirements, &#8220;suitability&#8221; determinations as to certain customer transactions, limitations in the amounts of fees and commissions that may be charged to customers, timing of proprietary trading in relation to customers&#8217; trades, disclosures to customers, and other matters. Many of these provisions may impose special regulatory and compliance obligations on us because of our expected foreign customer base. 

If FFIN reapplies and is granted licensure to operate as a broker-dealer, violations of federal or state laws or regulations or rules of SROs could subject FFIN and its principals and other employees to disciplinary proceedings or civil or criminal liability, including revocation of licenses, censures, fines, disgorgement, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from the conduct of its or their activities. Any such proceeding could have a material adverse effect upon our business. 

In addition to being regulated in the United States, our business will be subject to regulation by various foreign governments and regulatory bodies. If our acquisition of Freedom RU is completed, our activities through that entity, which is licensed in the Russian Federation to conduct open-ended brokerage, dealer, depository operations, and securities management, will be subject to regulation by the Central Bank of the Federation of Russia, which provides governmental regulation of company operations and protection of the interests of its customers. The acquisition of Freedom RU will also result in the acquisition of its wholly owned subsidiary, Freedom KZ. Freedom KZ provides professional services in the capital markets of Kazakhstan and is a professional participant of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange. Freedom KZ is regulated by the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. If our acquisition of Freedom CY is completed, our activities through that entity, which will be licensed in Cyprus, will be regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission. These authorities in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Cyprus enforce a comprehensive regulatory regime similar in nature and scope to the regulation of broker-dealers in the United States. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If FFIN elects to reapply for and becomes a licensed broker-dealer and if in the future FFIN were to expand its planned initial activities to include funds management, investment banking, venture capital, or private equity activities, its regulation would increase. We currently do not plan to engage in activities that would make us subject to registration under or compliance with the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940. To the extent that we operate in related areas in reliance on exemptions from these statutes, our failure to meet the requirements of any such exemptions could have a material adverse effect on the manner in which we conduct, or would like to conduct, our activities in order to service the expected demands of our customers or expand our operations. 

Additional legislation and regulations, particularly those relating to the activities of a broker-dealer, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC or other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities and SROs, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules&#8212;not only the regulations applicable to FFIN and the Freedom Companies (if our acquisition of any of those companies is completed) as broker-dealers, but also regulations of general application&#8212;may adversely affect our manner of operation and profitability. For example, the volume or nature of customer interest in particular investment products could be affected by, among other things, existing and proposed tax legislation, foreign investor limitations or regulation, antiterrorism considerations, antitrust policy, and other governmental regulations and policies (including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board) and changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities generally. 

Net Capital Requirements 

Broker-dealers registered with the SEC and member firms of FINRA are subject to the capital requirements of the SEC and FINRA. These capital requirements specify minimum levels of capital computed in accordance with extensive regulatory requirements (&#8220;net capital&#8221;) that each firm is required to maintain and also limit the amount of leverage (i.e., aggregate indebtedness compared to capital). The matrix of computational requirements includes a myriad of details respecting how assets are valued, the items to be included in aggregate indebtedness, the obligation to segregate customer funds and securities, and other items. 

If FFIN becomes a registered broker-dealer in the U.S., FFIN would clear its transactions through a clearing firm and, therefore, would not receive or hold customer funds or securities. We anticipate FFIN would be required to maintain net capital of only $5,000 under SEC Rule 15c3-1(2)(vi). Additional SRO requirements require a broker-dealer to reduce its business if its net capital (after giving effect to certain adjustments) is less than 120% of its net capital minimum dollar amount, which in FFIN&#8217;s case would effectively increase its net capital requirement to $6,000. In order to continue to be required only to maintain this minimal net capital, FFIN would be required to limit its activities. FFIN would have to increase its net capital substantially if it were to receive and hold customer funds or securities or expand its business to engage in activities for which additional capital is required. 

&#8220;Net capital&#8221; is essentially defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings, less the value of all of a broker-dealer&#8217;s assets that are not readily convertible into cash (such as goodwill, furniture, prepaid expenses, unsecured receivables), and further reduced by certain percentages (commonly called &#8220;haircuts&#8221;) of the market value of a broker-dealer&#8217;s inventory of securities and other financial instruments. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Failure of a broker-dealer to maintain its minimum required capital would require it to cease executing customer transactions until it increased its net capital to the compliance level and could cause it to lose its membership in an SRO or its registration with the SEC, which could cause its liquidation. Further, the decline in a broker-dealer&#8217;s net capital below certain &#8220;early warning levels,&#8221; even though above minimum capital requirements, could trigger immediate obligations to notify regulatory authorities and cause material adverse consequences to the broker-dealer. 

The SEC&#8217;s and FINRA&#8217;s capital rules also: (a) require that broker-dealers notify them before certain specified transactions that may impair net capital; (b) prohibit a broker-dealer from withdrawing or otherwise distributing equity capital or making related-party loans if they would impair net capital; and (c) provide that the SEC and FINRA may prohibit withdrawals of capital from a broker-dealer or the repayment of subordinated loans if the SEC or FINRA believes such withdrawals would be detrimental to the financial integrity of the firm or would unduly jeopardize the broker-dealer&#8217;s ability to pay its customer claims or other liabilities. 

Compliance with regulatory capital requirements could limit our expansion into activities and operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and financing of customer account balances. Net capital requirements also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiary broker-dealer, which in turn could limit our ability to transfer funds among our subsidiaries, pay dividends, repay debt, and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. 

We believe that FFIN has net capital sufficient to meet the requirements of its currently planned operations and do not plan to alter its proposed operations in the foreseeable future in any way that would require it to increase its net capital materially. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

The U.S. Patriot Act of 2001, which expands the application of provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency rules that require broker-dealers to implement and maintain a number of systems and procedures to ensure compliance with the statute. Substantive provisions of the Patriot Act specify standards that they must use to identify customers when accounts are opened and routinely thereafter and to monitor transaction and report suspicious activities. A growing anti-money laundering regulatory scheme outside the United States contains similar provisions. Failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on a broker-dealers business and expose it to possible sanctions, including substantial fines and penalties. 

If FFIN becomes a registered U.S. broker-dealer, its obligations respecting anti-money laundering would extend to our customers in Russia and Kazakhstan. We anticipate that any clearing agreement FFIN would have with a U.S. broker-dealer will provide for its collaboration in various aspects of our anti-money laundering compliance. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The 1970 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, broadly prohibits foreign bribery and mandates recordkeeping and accounting practices. The anti-bribery provisions make it illegal for us, either directly or through any subsidiary that we may acquire, to bribe any foreign official for the purpose of obtaining business. These provisions apply without regard to whether we have a U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. The term &#8220;public official&#8221; is defined broadly to include persons affiliated with government-sponsored or owned commercial enterprises as well as appointed or elected public officials. The recordkeeping provisions require that we make and maintain books that, in reasonable detail, reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets and devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls that enables us to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly recorded in accordance with management&#8217;s authorizations, that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements, that access to our funds and other assets is permitted only in accordance with management&#8217;s authorizations, and that the recorded accounts for assets are compared periodically with the existing assets to assure conformity. 

The FCPA requires that we establish and maintain an effective compliance program, through both our domestic employees and the foreign employees of our foreign subsidiaries, to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Our failure to comply with the FCPA could result in substantial fines and other sanctions. 

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 

The 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, was enacted in the United States to target non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers using foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions, such as the Freedom Companies, to report to the United States Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. 

The United States has entered into intergovernmental agreements with a number of countries establishing mutually agreed-upon rules for the implementation of the data sharing requirements of FATCA. It has not, however, entered into such an agreement with Russia. As a result, Russia adopted legislation to allow financial institutions to share foreign taxpayer data with foreign tax authorities, such as the IRS, without breaching Russian data protection and confidentiality laws. The Russian legislation sets forth extensive rules relating to when and how the financial institution may gather and share foreign taxpayer information. The Russian legislation establishes extensive monitoring procedures requiring, among other things, the notification to various Russian state bodies by the financial institution of registration with a foreign tax authority, receipt of requests for foreign taxpayer data, and the delivery to Russian state bodies of foreign taxpayer data prior to delivery to a foreign tax authority. Under the legislation, Russian regulators retain the right to prohibit disclosure of foreign taxpayer information in certain instances. Failure to comply with the Russian legislation may result in monetary fines for the financial institution and its officers. Because of the lack of an agreement between the U.S. and Russia establishing mutually agreed-upon guidelines for data sharing, inconsistencies in the two legal regimes exist, which can place a financial institution in Russia, such as Freedom RU, in the position of having to decide whether to comply with Russian legislation or with FATCA. For example, under Russian legislation, a financial institution may share foreign taxpayer data only with the consent of the foreign taxpayer, and even when consent is given, Russian regulators may, in certain circumstances, prohibit disclosure. There is no exemption for foreign financial institutions from the FATCA disclosure requirements. Similarly, FATCA generally requires the foreign financial institution to withhold 30% of designated payments. However, the Russian legislation does not grant financial institutions the authority to act as a withholding agent for a foreign tax authority. The Russian legislation does allow financial institutions to decline to provide services to foreign taxpayers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Kazakhstan and the United States have entered an intergovernmental agreement containing provisions regulating the process for Kazakh financial institutions to collect information on U.S. taxpayer accounts and provide that information to the IRS. In general, the requirements of the agreement concern the analysis of new and existing customer accounts to identify U.S. taxpayers. The agreement requires Kazakh financial institutions to register with the IRS and define their status in accordance with FATCA. Financial institutions are obligated to identify their clients and analyze their products to identify the accounts of customers affected by FATCA and collect all necessary information to classify those accounts in compliance with the requirements of FATCA. After classifying the accounts, financial institutions are obligated to regularly present information, including name, taxpayer identification number, and account balance, to the Kazakh tax authorities for transfer to the IRS. 

Cyprus and the United States have entered an intergovernmental agreement that requires Cyprus financial institutions to determine accounts maintained by U.S. tax residents, comply with verification and enhanced due diligence procedures, and provide annual reporting on these accounts to the Cyprus tax authorities who subsequently will provide the reports to the IRS. In addition, Cyprus financial institutions are required to make necessary tax withholdings to be paid to the IRS. As a &#8220;Reporting Financial Institution&#8221; under the intergovernmental agreement, Freedom CY will be required to obtain required client documentation associated with the indicia of his, her, or its U.S. tax residency status as well as all related account information in order to report accordingly. 

The failure to comply with FATCA could result in adverse financial and reputational consequences to Freedom RU, Freedom KZ, or Freedom CY as well as the imposition of sanctions or penalties including responsibility for the taxes on any funds distributed without the proper withholdings set aside. 

Foreign Regulation 

Russia 

Freedom RU provides professional services in the capital markets of the Russian Federation and is a professional participant of the Moscow and Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange. Freedom RU holds four licenses issued by the Federal Service for Financial Markets of the Russian Federation that allow it to provide brokerage, dealer, depository and securities management services in Russia. Freedom RU also provides foreign currency trading services. 

In Russia, a number of federal and industry regulatory agencies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. The Central Bank of the Federation of Russia (the &#8220;Central Bank&#8221;) is the principal financial market regulator responsible for the regulation of broker-dealers, depositories, and securities managers doing business in Russia. Industry SROs, each of which has authority over the firms that are its members, include the Association of Securities Market Participants (&#8220;NAUFOR&#8221;), National Securities Market Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;) national securities exchanges such as the Moscow Stock Exchange and the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange on which securities are traded, and other SROs. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Freedom RU is subject to overlapping schemes of regulation that govern all aspects of its securities business. The regulations cover a broad range of practices and procedures, including: 

&#9679; 

capital requirements; 

&#9679; 

the use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities; 

&#9679; 

recordkeeping and reporting requirements; 

&#9679; 

customer identity, clearance, and monitoring to identify and prevent money laundering; 

&#9679; 

supervisory and organizational procedures intended to monitor and assure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading practices; 

&#9679; 

transaction execution, clearance, and settlement procedures; 

&#9679; 

qualification of firm management; and 

&#9679; 

risk detection, management, and correction. 

The Central Bank, NAUFOR, and NFA regulations include rules governing practices and procedures addressing the relationship between broker-dealers and their customers. As a result, many aspects of the broker-dealer customer relationship are subject to regulation. These regulations include customer identification and due diligence procedures, collection of customer financial suitability documentation, anti-money laundering monitoring and reporting, customer fees, clearing, settlements, risk management and other matters. 

&#160;

Violations of securities laws and regulations by broker-dealers and other securities industry fiduciaries in Russia can subject them to a broad range of disciplinary actions including remedial actions, imposition of fines and sanctions, removal from managerial positions, loss of licensing, and criminal proceedings. 

Capital Requirements 

The Central Bank establishes minimum net capital requirements for securities market participants including brokerages, dealers, depositories and securities managers. In the event the net capital of such service provider drops below the minimum requirement, it is obligated to notify the Central Bank, provide a plan to meet its minimum capital requirements and perform all actions necessary to bring it back into compliance with the net capital requirement. The minimum net capital requirement of Freedom RU to provide brokerage, dealer, depository, securities management, and foreign currency trading services is approximately $2,770,000, which it currently has. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In the event a broker-dealer fails to maintain its minimum net capital, it must immediately notify the Central Bank. The Central Bank may take any of the following actions, (i) require the broker-dealer to submit a detailed plan to increase its net capital to at least the minimum requirement, (ii) impose financial penalties in the event the broker-dealer does not provide a detailed explanation as to the reasons for the decrease below the minimum requirement, (iii) cause the broker-dealer to cease operations until it meets the minimum net capital requirement, (iv) suspend the broker-dealer&#8217;s licenses for a period of time, and (v) in case of failures, the Central Bank can withdraw licensure and disqualify the firm&#8217;s management from working within the industry. This disqualification can be for up to a three-year period for the general director, controller and the head of the compliance department of the broker-dealer. 

Compliance with minimum capital requirements could limit Freedom RU&#8217;s expansion into activities and operations that require the intensive use of capital. Minimum capital requirements could also restrict our ability to withdraw capital from Freedom RU, which in turn could limit our ability to transfer funds among our subsidiaries. Additionally, the failure of Freedom RU to maintain its minimum net capital requirement could result in penalties or other sanctions. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

The law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (&#8220;AML Law&#8221;) establishes laws designed to prevent money laundering activities and financing of terrorism. The AML Law is supported by recommendations, binding instructions and regulations of the Central Bank and other authorities. The AML Law requires institutions dealing with cash operations, including all kinds of financial institutions, which includes professional participants in the securities markets, to establish mandatory internal protocols for client and payment acceptance. In particular, regulated entities must perform due diligence procedures to ascertain the identity of the customer and monitor transactions for suspicious activity. Regulated entities must identify and report transactions falling within certain categories. If either party to such transactions is suspected of being connected to terrorist activity the transaction is subject to mandatory control regardless of the nature of the transaction. 

The Central Bank may take preventative or enforcement measures against regulated financial institutions involved in transactions that infringe on anti-money laundering legislation. Preventative measures may include issuing an order to cease a violation and provide the Central Bank with a program for improvement and establishing additional monitoring measures. Enforcement measures may include the imposition of fines and withdrawal of licenses. The failure of Freedom RU to comply with the AML Law could subject it to material legal action, which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Freedom RU. 

Kazakhstan 

The acquisition of Freedom RU will also result in the acquisition of its wholly owned subsidiary, Freedom KZ. Freedom KZ provides professional services in the capital markets of Kazakhstan and is a professional participant of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, which enables Freedom KZ to manage investment portfolios for its clients. Freedom KZ is regulated by the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In Kazakhstan the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the &#8220;NBK&#8221;) and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (the &#8220;KASE&#8221;) are the principal organizations tasked with safeguarding the stability of financial markets and financial institutions. The NBK and KASE are responsible for setting the standards for regulating the activities of financial institutions and participants in the financial services industry and for monitoring compliance. Settlement services for securities transactions are primarily governed by the rules and procedures of the Central Depositary. 

Freedom KZ is licensed to provide broker-dealer services with the right to carry customer accounts and to provide investment portfolio management services. Freedom KZ has 13 offices located in 13 cities in Kazakhstan. 

Freedom KZ is subject to overlapping schemes of regulation that govern all aspects of its securities business. The regulations cover a broad range of practices and procedures, including: 

&#9679; 

capital requirements; 

&#9679; 

the use and safekeeping of customers&#8217; funds and securities; 

&#9679; 

recordkeeping and reporting requirements; 

&#9679; 

customer identity, clearance, and monitoring to identify and prevent money laundering; 

&#9679; 

supervisory and organizational procedures intended to monitor and assure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading practices; 

&#9679; 

transaction execution, clearance, and settlement procedures; 

&#9679; 

qualification of firm management; and 

&#9679; 

risk detection, management and correction. 

NBK and KASE regulations include rules governing practices and procedures addressing the relationship between broker-dealers and their customers. As a result, many aspects of the broker-dealer customer relationship are subject to regulation. These regulations include customer identification and due diligence procedures, collection of customer financial suitability documentation, anti-money laundering anti-terrorism funding monitoring and reporting, customer fees, clearing, settlements, and other matters. 

&#160;

The Republic of Kazakhstan has adopted extensive regulation regarding the responsibility for wrongdoing by broker-dealers and investment portfolio managers, ranging from disciplinary action to criminal punishments. The penalties available to the NBK in the event of wrongdoing include cancelation of licenses, removal of management, monetary damages and criminal prosecution. The NBK may also impose remedial requirements, such as requiring the wrongdoer to provide a plan of remediation to ensure the wrongdoing is prevented in the future. Action may be taken against the broker-dealer, the management board of the broker-dealer or both depending on the severity of the violation. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

Kazakhstan regulation establishes minimum share capital requirements for broker-dealers and investment portfolio managers. In the event the net capital of a broker-dealer or investment portfolio manager falls below the requirement, it is obligated to notify the NBK, provide a plan to meet is minimum capital requirements and perform all actions to bring it back into compliance with the requirement. The minimum capital for broker-dealers with a license to provide investment portfolio management services is approximately $760,000. The net capital requirement must be calculated on a daily basis. 

The failure of a broker-dealer to maintain its minimum capital requirement could result in the NBK taking any of the following enforcement measures, (i) requiring a letter of commitment to comply, (ii) execution of a written agreement to comply; (iii) issue a warning; (iv) issue a written prescription to eliminate the violation; and (v) impose penalties. Enforcement measures may be imposed on the broker-dealer or on top management of the broker-dealer or both depending on the severity of the violation. 

Compliance with minimum capital requirements could limit Freedom KZ&#8217;s expansion into activities and operations that require the intensive use of capital. Minimum capital requirements could also restrict our ability to withdraw capital from Freedom KZ, which in turn could limit our ability to transfer funds among our subsidiaries. Additionally, if Freedom KZ falls below it minimum capital requirements the NBK could impose penalties or other sanctions on Freedom KZ. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

The Law on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating of Terrorism Financing (&#8220;AML/CFT&#8221;) establishes laws designed to combat money laundering and funding of terrorist activities. By regulation adopted by the NBK, companies operating in the financial services industry in Kazakhstan are required to establish procedures designed to ensure, among other things, that the broker-dealer: 

&#9679; 

undertake adequate due diligence of its customers; 

&#9679; 

perform financial monitoring of operations related to transfers of cash and property; 

&#9679; 

monitor transactions and report suspicious activities to appropriate authorities; and 

&#9679; 

provide periodic reporting to appropriate authorities. 

The failure of Freedom KZ to comply with AML/CFT requirements could subject it to material sanctions, including penalties and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Freedom KZ.

Cyprus 

Freedom CY has applied for and been granted licensure by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange (&#8220;CySEC&#8221;) to provide investment and ancillary services as a Cypriot Investment Firm (&#8220;CIF&#8221;). Freedom CY is currently putting in place the necessary infrastructure to activate its license. If our acquisition of Freedom CY is completed and Freedom CY&#8217;s license is activated, its activities will be regulated by and under the supervision CySEC, an independent public supervisory authority, responsible for the supervision of the investment services market and transactions in transferable securities carried out in the Republic of Cyprus. As a CIF, the activities of Freedom CY will be subject to various laws including the Cyprus Investment Act of 2002-2005, which provides the legal framework for the operation and supervision of CIFs, the rules and regulations of the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II and Regulation (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;). 

The MiFID is aimed at creating a single, more transparent market in financial services across all EU member states, to (i) improve the competitiveness and integration of EU financial markets by creating a single market for investment services and activities, (ii) ensure a high degree of harmonized protection for investors in financial instruments, (iii) increase market transparency, and (iv) promote easier cross border business. The MiFID allows registered investment firms to provide services throughout the EU on the basis of the home country supervision. 

When Freedom CY&#8217;s license is activated, like the other Freedom Companies, it will be subject to an overlapping scheme of regulation that will cover all aspects of its securities business. These regulations cover a broad range of matters, including: 

&#9679; 

capital requirements; 

&#9679; 

safekeeping of clients&#8217; funds and assets; 

&#9679; 

recordkeeping and reporting requirements; 

&#9679; 

client identification, clearance and monitoring to identify and prevent money laundering and funding of terrorism and facilitate FATCA reporting; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

supervisory and organizational procedures intended to monitor and assure compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and to prevent improper trading practices; 

&#9679; 

employee-related matters, including qualification and certification of personnel; and 

&#9679; 

provision of investment and ancillary services, clearance, and settlement procedures. 

Serious or systematic infringement of rules, regulations and directives of the laws, rules and regulations of Cyprus securities laws and/or the directives issued pursuant relevant EU regulations could subject Freedom CY, its principals and other employees to disciplinary proceedings or civil or criminal liability, including withdrawal of CySEC licensure, administrative fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from the performance of Freedom CY&#8217;s business activities. Any such proceeding could have an adverse material effect upon business activity of Freedom CY. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

Freedom CY is subject to the capital requirements of the CRD IV package of the Capital Requirements Directives of the European Union. A CIF must maintain a minimum initial capital requirement of approximately $220,000 if it holds client assets or client financial instruments and provides any of the following services: (i) receiving and transmitting orders, (ii) executing orders on behalf of clients; (iii) providing portfolio management; or (iv) providing investment advice. The minimum initial capital requirement for a CIF providing any of the above services without holding client assets or client financial instruments is approximately $87,000, with some exceptions. As Freedom CY will hold client assets and client financial instruments, we anticipate that Freedom CY will have an initial minimum capital requirement of approximately $220,000. 

At all times Freedom CY&#8217;s minimum net capital must meet or exceed certain target capital ratios. The capital ratio is a percentage calculated by dividing: (a) the total of the firm&#8217;s Basel III Tier 1 capital (the sum of its common shares, share surplus, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and other disclosed reserves and common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries that meet the criteria for inclusion, subject to regulatory adjustments) and its Basel III Tier 2 capital (instruments that meet the criteria for Tier 2 capital that are not included in Tier 1 capital, share premium resulting from instruments included in Tier 2 capital, instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries and held by third parties that are not included in Tier 1 capital and certain loan loss provisions, subject to regulatory adjustments applied in calculation of Tier 2 capital); by (b) the sum of risk-weighted exposures (including credit, currency and operational risk exposures. Currently, Freedom CY must maintain a minimum total capital ratio of 8% and a minimum total Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%. 

Cyprus securities rules require all CIFs to have processes in place to assess and maintain the minimum capital requirements on an ongoing basis. These processes are subject to regular internal review to ensure that they remain comprehensive and proportionate to the nature of the activities of the CIF. If a CIF fails to maintain its minimum capital requirement, the CIF is required to timely notify the CySEC of such failure. CySEC may, at its discretion, set a deadline by which the CIF must remedy the situation. If a CIF violates the net capital requirements and the directives issued by CySEC, CySEC may, in its absolute discretion based on the gravity of the violation, impose measures, penalties and sanctions including, (i) withdrawal or suspension of CIF authorization, (ii) publicly censure the CIF and the individuals responsible, (iii) issue cease and desist orders against the CIF and the individuals committing such violations, (iv) temporarily ban the individuals responsible for the violation and members of the CIF&#8217;s board of directors from exercising functions for a CIF, and (v) impose financial penalties upon the CIF and the individuals responsible for the violation. 

Compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements could limit Freedom CY&#8217;s expansion into activities and operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as dealing on its own account or underwriting or placing securities. Minimum capital requirements also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from Freedom CY, which in turn could limit our ability to transfer funds among our subsidiaries. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Investor Compensation Fund 

Pursuant to CySEC legislation, CIF&#8217;s are required to register as members of the Investor Compensation Fund (the &#8220;ICF&#8221;) for the protection of CIF clients, and must comply with the obligations of the ICF. The ICF was established to compensate CIF covered clients as to covered investment services and ancillary services. Payment of compensation by the ICF is subject to the existence of a well-founded claim by the client against a member of the Fund. The amount of compensation payable to each covered client is calculated in accordance with the legal and contractual terms governing the relationship of the covered client with the CIF, subject to the off-set rules applied for the calculations of claims. The maximum pay out by the ICF is approximately $22,000. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

The Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Law of 2007, imposes laws and regulations designed to prevent the use of the Cyprus financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. The law places special responsibilities on financial institutions, including CIFs, to implement and adhere to prescribed procedures for customer identification, record keeping and internal reporting and reporting of suspicious money laundering transactions. This law imposes requirements on such institutions to ensure that all employees are aware of their obligations under the law and receive adequate training designed to assist them in recognizing and reporting suspicious transactions. Freedom CY&#8217;s failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on its business and expose it to possible sanctions, including substantial fines and penalties. Freedom CY&#8217;s obligations respecting anti-money laundering will extend to its customers in Russia and Kazakhstan. 

Employees 

We currently have one employee, who works for FFIN on a full-time basis as its principal. He is located at FFIN&#8217;s principal executive offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. We will add employees as warranted if we obtain regulatory approval to engage in business as a securities broker-dealer.
