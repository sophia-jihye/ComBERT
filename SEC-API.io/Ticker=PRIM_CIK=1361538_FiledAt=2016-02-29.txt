 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

Primoris Services Corporation (&#147;Primoris&#148;, the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148;, or &#147;our&#148;) is a holding company of various subsidiaries which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, water and wastewater, and engineering services to major public utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services. 

&#160; 

Historically, we have longstanding relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length &#151; from several weeks to as long as 48 months for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer, in any year a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Select Global Market under the symbol &#147;PRIM&#148;. Founded as ARB, Inc. (&#147;ARB&#148;) in 1960, we became organized as Primoris in Nevada in 2003, and we became a Delaware public company in July 2008 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company (a non-operating shell company). 

&#160; 

Our service capabilities and geographic footprint have expanded primarily through the following four significant acquisitions over the last six years. 

&#160; 

In 2009, we acquired James Construction Group, LLC, a privately-held Florida limited liability company (&#147;JCG&#148;). Headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, JCG is one of the largest general contractors based in the Gulf Coast states and is engaged in highway, industrial and environmental construction, primarily in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Florida. JCG and its predecessor company have been in business for over 80 years. 

&#160; 

In 2010, we acquired Rockford Corporation (&#147;Rockford&#148;). Rockford specializes in construction of large diameter natural gas and liquid pipeline projects and related facilities throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

In 2012, we purchased Sprint Pipeline Services, L.P. (&#147;Sprint&#148;), a Texas based company headquartered near Houston, which we renamed as Primoris Pipeline Services (&#147;PPS&#148;) in March 2015. PPS provides a comprehensive range of pipeline construction, maintenance, upgrade, fabrication and specialty services primarily in the southeastern United States. 

&#160; 

In November 2012, we purchased Q3 Contracting, Inc., a privately-held Minnesota corporation (&#147;Q3C&#148;). Based in Little Canada, Minnesota (north of St. Paul), Q3C specializes in small diameter pipeline and gas distribution construction, restoration and other services, primarily in the upper Midwest region of the United States. 

&#160; 

In addition to these primary acquisitions, we have entered into several agreements to purchase smaller businesses or business assets to start a business as we continue to seek opportunities to expand our skill sets or operating locations. These include The Saxon Group (&#147;Saxon&#148;) and The Silva Group (&#147;Silva&#148;) (merged with JCG) which we acquired in 2012. During 2014 we acquired Vadnais Trenchless Services, Inc. (&#147;Vadnais&#148;) and made three small acquisitions during the third quarter, consisting of the purchase of the net assets of Surber Roustabout, LLC (&#147;Surber&#148;), Ram-Fab, LLC (&#147;Ram-Fab&#148;) and Williams Testing, LLC (&#147;Williams&#148;). In February 2015, we acquired the net assets of Aevenia, Inc. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates especially those with strong management teams with good reputations. 

&#160; 

Reportable Segments 

&#160; 

The Company segregates its business into three operating segments: the West Construction Services segment (&#147;West segment&#148;), the East Construction Services segment (&#147;East segment&#148;) and the Energy segment (&#147;Energy segment&#148;). 

&#160; 

The West segment includes the underground and industrial operations and construction services performed by ARB, ARB Structures, Inc., Rockford, Q3C, and Vadnais. ARB and ARB Structures perform work primarily in California; while, Rockford operates throughout the United States and Q3C operates in Colorado and the upper Midwest United States. The segment also includes three joint venture operations. The West segment consists of business headquartered primarily in the Western United States. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The East segment includes the JCG Heavy Civil division, JCG Infrastructure and Maintenance division, BW Primoris and Cardinal Contractors, Inc. construction businesses, located primarily in the Southeastern United States and the Gulf Coast region of the United States. 

&#160; 

The Energy segment includes the operations of the Primoris Energy Services (&#147;PES&#148;) pipeline and gas facility construction and maintenance operations and the PES Industrial division, whose operations are located primarily in the southeastern United States and in the Gulf Coast region. This segment also includes the Primoris Aevenia,Inc. (&#147;Aevenia&#148;), Surber and Ram-Fab operations and the OnQuest, Inc. and OnQuest Canada, ULC operations, which provide for the design and installation of liquid natural gas (&#147;LNG&#148;) facilities and high-performance furnaces and heaters for the oil refining, petrochemical and power generation industries. 

&#160; 

Each of the three segments specializes in a range of services that include designing, building/installing, replacing, repairing/rehabilitating and providing management services for construction related projects. Our services include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing installation of underground pipeline, cable and conduits for entities in the petroleum, petrochemical and water industries;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing maintenance services to utilities for installation and repair of gas distribution lines;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing installation and maintenance of industrial facilities for entities in the petroleum, petrochemical and water industries;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing installation of commercial and industrial cast-in-place structures;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing construction of highways and bridges; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Providing industrial and environmental construction.

&#160; 

Trends 

&#160; 

We continue to operate in an uncertain business environment with increasing regulatory requirements and a significant decrease in the price of commodities, including oil and gas pricing, during the last 18 months. While by many indicators the United States economy has recovered from the recessionary levels of the past few years, capital expenditure levels by many of our customers have remained at lower levels. Economic and regulatory issues have adversely affected our customers and have affected demand for our services. For some of our customers, the additional uncertainty associated with state and federal budgets adds to the difficulty in predicting the timing or magnitude that industry trends may have on our business, particularly in the near-term. 

&#160; 

The direct impact of the reduction in oil and gas prices is found in three of our end markets: upstream, midstream and downstream. The lower commodity prices have reduced to a minimum the capital expenditure budgets of oil and gas producers which have reduced or eliminated most work in the oil and gas shale formations. This has reduced the demand for our upstream pipeline services such as opportunities in oil and gas gathering lines, compressor systems and related infrastructure especially in the shale formations. While the longer term opportunities for midstream customers remain, as the existing pipeline infrastructure appears to be insufficient to meet the potential natural gas demand, in the near term capital expenditure is expected to fall. However, the lower natural gas prices may provide midstream opportunities to build large diameter pipelines for gas utility customers. Finally for downstream refineries, low prices tend to lead to more maintenance and outage work as plants are operated at higher levels; however, the low oil prices may result in delays and deferral for some of the maintenance work.

&#160; 

The gas utility industry continues to outsource an increasing amount of its infrastructure construction, maintenance and inspection services. Large rate regulated utilities in many states continue to rely more on outside contractors, rather than their own employees, to provide many of the services needed to maintain and expand their utility plants. This trend provides opportunity for our West segment operations. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Energy Information Administration has stated that the number of natural gas-fired power plants built will increase significantly over the next two decades. While renewable energy generation continues to increase and become a larger percentage of the overall power generation mix, natural gas facilities, especially the conversion of current facilities to more efficient sources of power, may provide a significant contribution to the revenue and profitability of the West segment and over the next few years also the Energy segment. Regulations limiting the discharge of cooling water into the ocean will require construction of alternative cooling systems and may lead to repowering at current sites over the next few years in California. 

&#160; 

As many states institute renewable power standards mandating renewable energy generation as a part of the total power usage, large, utility-scale projects will provide construction opportunities over the next few years. In many locations, the development 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and construction of solar and wind facilities may result in a need for traditional plants to meet demand when the renewable resources are not available. In addition, alternative energy sources such as &#147;waste-to-power&#148; facilities provide long-term construction opportunities. The low long-term natural gas prices and the increased emission regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency may result in the construction of gas-fired power plants as an alternative to coal-fired plants. We believe that our gas-fired plant experience and industry knowledge will provide opportunities for us. 

&#160; 

The continuing long-term low cost of natural gas is leading to industrial opportunities, as chemical plants that use natural gas as a feedstock initiate new projects or expand current facilities. Construction for many of these projects is expected in the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast region, which requires significant site preparation work as part of the project. Both our East and Energy segments provide services to many of the companies planning facility additions. 

&#160; 

The low price and abundance of natural gas may lead to the development and construction of LNG export facilities, since natural gas prices in many international markets are greater than those in the United States. Future export LNG facilities could also provide opportunity for construction of additional pipelines. In addition, the development of small scale LNG facilities could provide opportunity for both our East and Energy segments. 

&#160; 

At the end of 2015, opportunities for our highway construction services improved. The federal government enacted a four-year highway funding program, and the voters in the state of Texas adopted Proposition 7 to increase highway funding. In the United States, highway funding increased in 2015 compared to 2014. Our highway construction operation is focused on the states of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Of these states, Texas continues to increase its highway construction budget, while the other two states have cut back funding in the past several years. 

&#160; 

Over the past few years, several areas of the United States have suffered significant drought-like conditions. In these areas, state and municipal officials are considering using alternative sources for potable water, including using water pipelines to transport water from distant aquifers or building complex water treatment facilities to treat non-potable water. In some areas such as West Texas, state agencies are contemplating significant investment to improve the quantity of water. These investments may provide an opportunity for our East segment services. However, the planning cycle for major water and wastewater projects to address the drought tends to move very slowly, and opportunities may take several years to come to fruition. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy continues to emphasize the following key elements: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Diversification Through Controlled Expansion. We continue to emphasize the expansion of our scope of services beyond our current focus by increasing the scope of services offered to current customers and by adding new customers. We will evaluate acquisitions that offer growth opportunities and the ability to leverage our resources as a leading service provider to the oil and gas, power, refining and water industries. Our strategy also considers selective expansion to new geographic regions.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Emphasis on Retention of Existing Customers and Recurring Revenue. In order to fully leverage our relationships with our existing customer base, we believe it is important to maintain strong customer relationships and to expand our base of recurring revenue sources and recurring customers.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Ownership of Equipment. Many of our services are equipment intensive. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership of a large and varied construction fleet and our maintenance facilities enhances our access to reliable equipment at a favorable cost.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Stable Work Force. Our business model emphasizes self-performance of a significant portion of our work. In each of our separate segments, we maintain a stable work force of skilled, experienced laborers, many of whom are cross-trained in projects such as pipeline and facility construction, refinery maintenance, and piping systems.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Selective Bidding. We selectively bid on projects that we believe offer an opportunity to meet our profitability objectives or that offer the opportunity to enter promising new markets. In addition, we review our bidding opportunities to attempt to minimize concentration of work with any one customer, in any one industry, or in stressed labor markets. We believe that by carefully positioning ourselves in market segments that have meaningful barriers of entry, we can position ourselves so that we compete with other strong, experienced bidders.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Maintain a conservative capital structure and strong balance sheet. We have maintained a capital structure that provides access to debt financing as needed while relying on tangible net worth to provide the primary support for our operations. We believe this structure provides both our customers and banks and bonding companies assurance of our financial

&#160; 

&#160; 

capabilities. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability; however, we have not had any outstanding bank borrowing against this facility while we have been a public company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Backlog is discussed in Item 7. &#147; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. Through JCG, we expanded our customer base to include a significant presence in the Gulf Coast region of the United States; with Q3C, we expanded into the upper Midwest United States; and with Rockford, we are expanding throughout the United States. The various acquisitions have also changed the composition of our customer base with significant increases in state agency projects. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length &#151; from several weeks, to as long as 48 months for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues. 

&#160; 

Our customers have included many of the leading energy and utility companies in the United States, including, among others, Enterprise Liquids Pipeline, Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas &#38; Electric, Southern California Gas, Sempra Energy, Williams, NRG, Chevron, Calpine, and Kinder Morgan. 

&#160; 

The following customers accounted for more than 5% of our revenues in the periods indicated:

(*) &#160; Indicates a customer with less than 5% of revenues during such period.

&#160; 

As can be seen from the table, the customers accounting for revenues in excess of 5% each year varies from year to year due to the nature of our business. A large construction project for a customer may result in significant revenues in that one year, with significantly less revenues in subsequent years after project completion. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 59.4%, 53.6% and 50.0%, respectively, of total revenues were generated from the top ten customers of the Company in each year. In each of the years, a different group of customers comprised the top ten customers by revenue. 

&#160; 

Management at each of our business units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our business unit management teams build existing customer relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. Business unit managers are also responsible for pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers. 

&#160; 

We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Some of our strategic relationships are in the form of strategic alliance or long-term maintenance agreements. However, we realize that future opportunities also require cost effective bids, as pricing is a key element for most construction projects.

Competition 

&#160; 

We face substantial competition on large construction projects from both regional and national contractors. Competitors on small construction projects range from a few large construction companies to a variety of smaller contractors. We compete with many local and regional firms for construction services and with a number of large firms on select projects. Each business segment faces varied competition depending on the types of project and services offered. 

&#160; 

We compete with different companies in different end markets. Large competitors in our underground markets include Quanta Services, Inc. and MasTec Inc.; competitors in our industrial end markets include Kiewit Corporation; and competitors in our highway services include Sterling Construction Company, and privately-held Boh Brothers and Zachary Construction Company. In each market we may also compete with local, private companies. 

&#160; 

We believe that the primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation for quality, delivery and safety, relevant experience, availability of skilled labor, machinery and equipment, financial strength, knowledge of local markets and conditions, and estimating abilities. We believe that we compete favorably in all of these factors. 

&#160; 

Geographic Areas &#151; Financial Information 

&#160; 

The majority of the Company&#146;s revenues are derived from customers in the United States with approximately 1% generated from sources outside the United States. Assets located outside the United States also represent approximately 1% of total assets of the Company. Our revenue from operations in the United States is related to projects primarily in the geographic United States. Our revenue from operations in Canada is primarily derived from our Energy segment&#146;s office in Calgary, Canada, but relates to specific projects in other countries, such as in the Far East and Australia. 

&#160; 

Risks Attendant to Foreign Operations 

&#160; 

In 2015 less than 1% of our revenue was attributable to external customers in foreign countries. The current expectation is that a similar portion of revenue will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future. Though a small portion of our revenues, international operations are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks as disclosed more fully in Item 1A &#147; Risk Factors &#148; of this Annual Report. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased costs and potential losses. Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control. 

&#160; 

Contract Provisions and Subcontracting 

&#160; 

We typically structure contracts as unit-price, time and material, fixed-price or cost plus fixed fee. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed price or fixed unit price contracts. While the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the party retaining us, any increase in our unit cost over the unit price bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, is borne by us. Under a fixed price contract, we undertake to provide labor, equipment and services required by a project for a competitively bid or negotiated fixed price. The materials required under a fixed price contract, such as pipe, turbines, boilers and vessels are often supplied by the party retaining us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under a fixed unit price contract, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices. Both cost and quantity risks related to time and material and cost plus fixed fee contracts are generally shifted to the party retaining us. 

&#160; 

Construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing customers. We are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by recurring customers who maintain pre-qualified contractor lists. Contractors are selected for the pre-approved contractor lists by virtue of their prior performance for such customers, as well as their experience, reputation for quality, safety record, financial strength and bonding capacity. 

&#160; 

In evaluating bid opportunities, we consider such factors as the customer, the geographic location of the work, the availability of labor, our competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to other likely contractors, our current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, and the project&#146;s cost and profitability estimates. We use computer-based estimating systems and our estimating staff has significant experience in the construction industry. The project estimates form the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project cost system; thereby enabling management to monitor a project. Project costs are accumulated and monitored regularly against billings and payments to assure proper control of cash flow on the project. 

&#160; 

Most contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner. In addition, many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met. To date, these provisions have not materially adversely affected us. 

&#160; 

We act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, we are potentially subject to increased costs and reputational risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. While we subcontract specialized activities such as blasting, hazardous waste removal and electrical work, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources, including labor and equipment. 

&#160; 

Our gas distribution services are typically provided pursuant to renewable contracts on a &#147;unit-cost&#148; basis. Fees on unit-cost contracts are negotiated and are earned based on units completed. Historically, substantially all of the gas distribution customers have renewed their maintenance contracts. Facilities maintenance services, such as regularly scheduled and emergency repair work, are provided on an ongoing basis at predetermined rates. 

&#160; 

Risk Management, Insurance and Bonding 

&#160; 

We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance, covering our construction equipment, and workers&#146; compensation insurance, in amounts consistent with industry practices. In the States of California, Texas and Louisiana, we self-insure our workers&#146; compensation claims in an amount of up to $250,000 per occurrence, and we maintain insurance covering larger claims. In addition, we maintain umbrella coverage policies. We believe that our insurance programs are adequate. 

&#160; 

We maintain a diligent safety and risk management program that has resulted in a favorable loss experience factor. Through our safety director and the employment of a large staff of regional and site specific safety managers, we have been able to effectively assess and control potential losses and liabilities in both the pre-construction and performance phases of our projects. Though we strongly focus on safety in the workplace, we cannot give assurances that we can prevent or reduce all injuries or claims in our workplace. 

&#160; 

In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds guaranteeing our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, backlog, past performance, management expertise and other factors and the surety company&#146;s current underwriting standards. To date, we have obtained the level of surety bonds necessary for the needs of our business. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations including: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Licensing, permitting and inspection requirements;

&#183; &#160; Regulations relating to worker safety, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;

&#183; &#160; Permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; and

&#183; &#160; Contractor licensing requirements.

&#160; 

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters and Climate Change Impacts 

&#160; 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under some of these laws and regulations, liability can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing. 

&#160; 

In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our contracts with our customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance. 

&#160; 

The potential physical impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Item 1A. &#147; Risk Factors&#148; , our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins. 

&#160; 

Climate change could also affect our customers and the types of projects that they award. Demand for power projects, underground pipelines or highway projects could be affected by significant changes in weather. Reductions in project awards could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.

Employees 

&#160; 

We believe that our employees are our most valuable resource in successfully completing construction work. Our ability to maintain sufficient continuous work for approximately 5,500 hourly employees helps us to instill in our employees loyalty to and understanding of our policies and contributes to our strong production, safety and quality record. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 1,209 salaried employees and 5,802 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel employed is subject to the volume of construction in progress. During the calendar year 2015, the aggregate number of employees ranged from approximately 5,500 to 7,000.

Several of our subsidiaries have operations that are unionized through the negotiation and execution of collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration. We have not experienced recent work stoppages and believe our employee and union relations are good.
