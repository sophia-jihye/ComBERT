 Item 1. Business 

We invest in healthcare real estate, such as seniors housing and medical office buildings ("MOB"), located in the United States for investment purposes. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 166 &#32;properties located in 29 &#32;states and comprised of 8.5 million &#32;rentable square feet. 

We were incorporated on October 15, 2012 as a Maryland corporation that elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Healthcare Trust Operating Partnership, LP (the "OP"), formerly known as American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust II Operating Partnership, LP. 

In February 2013, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to $1.7 billion &#32;of common stock, $0.01 &#32;par value per share, at a price of $25.00 &#32;per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts. We closed our IPO in November 2014, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $2.1 billion . 

On March 18, 2015, we announced our intention to list our common stock on a national stock exchange under the symbol &#8220;HTI&#8221; (the "Listing") during the third quarter of 2015. On September 24, 2015, we announced that our board of directors had determined that it was in our best interest to not pursue the Listing during the third quarter of 2015. Our board of directors continues to monitor market conditions and other factors with a view toward reevaluating the Listing decision when market conditions are more favorable. There can be no assurance that our shares of common stock will be listed. We anticipate publishing an estimate of per share NAV on or prior to April 11, 2016 (the "NAV pricing date"), and subsequent valuations will occur periodically, at the discretion of our board of directors, provided that such calculations will be made at least annually. In the interim, we will continue to offer shares pursuant to the DRIP at $23.75 per share, and to repurchase shares pursuant to the share repurchase plan ("SRP"). Beginning with the NAV pricing date, the per share price for shares under the DRIP and SRP will vary periodically and will be based on our NAV. 

We have no direct employees. Our Advisor has been retained by us to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have retained the Property Manager to serve as our property manager. The Advisor and the Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, as a result of which they are related parties, and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing our business. The Advisor, Property Manager and our former dealer manager, Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager"), also have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements from us related to the investment and management of our assets. 

Our Former Dealer Manager served as the dealer manager of our IPO and, together with certain of its affiliates, continued to provide us with services through December 31, 2015. RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided us with services, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor. 

Healthcare Industry 

Healthcare is the single largest industry in the United States based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health Expenditures Projections, 2014 - 2024 report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 4.9% in 2016 and 5.4% in 2017; (ii) the average compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2016 through 2024, is anticipated to be 5.9%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to represent 18.1% of U.S. GDP in 2016. This growth in expenditures has led to significant growth in healthcare employment. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the healthcare industry was one of the largest industries in the United States, providing over 15.3 million jobs as of December 31, 2015. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of healthcare occupations (healthcare practitioners and technical occupations and healthcare support) is projected to grow 19% from 2014 to 2024, adding about 2.3 million new jobs. This growth is expected due to an aging population and the projected increase in the number of individuals who have access to health insurance. We believe the continued growth in employment in the healthcare industry will lead to growth in demand for medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. 

In addition to the growth in national health expenditures and corresponding increases in employment in the healthcare sector, the nature of healthcare delivery continues to evolve due to the impact of government programs, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. We believe these changes have increased the need for capital among healthcare providers and increased incentives for these providers to develop more efficient real estate solutions in order to enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. In particular, we believe the following demographic factors and trends are creating an attractive environment in which to invest in healthcare properties. 

Demographics 

The aging of the U.S. population has a direct effect on the demand for healthcare as older persons generally utilize healthcare services at a rate well in excess of younger people. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 65-year and older segment of the population spends 120% more on healthcare than the 45 to 64-year-old segment and 160% more than the population average. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the "CDC"), 6.5% of all adults aged 65 and over in 2014 needed help with personal care from another person. For both sexes combined, adults aged 85 years and over (18.1%) were more than twice as likely as adults aged 75 to 84 (7.4%) to need help with personal care from other persons; adults aged 85 and over were slightly more than five times as likely as adults aged 65 to 74 (3.5%) to need help with personal care from other persons. Also, according to the CDC, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other forms of dementia usually occurs in individuals who are 60 years old and older. Starting at age 65, the risk of developing the disease doubles every five years. By age 85 years and older, between 25 and 50 percent of people will exhibit signs of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Up to 5.3 million Americans currently have Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and by 2050 the number is expected to more than double due to the aging of the population. 

We believe that the aging population, improved chronic disease management, technological advances and healthcare reform will positively affect the demand for medical office buildings and seniors housing communities and other healthcare-related facilities and generate attractive investment opportunities. The first wave of Baby Boomers, the largest segment of the U.S. population, began turning 65 in 2011. According to the Pew Research Center, the U.S. population over 65 will grow to 81 million in 2050, up from 37 million in 2005. This group will grow more rapidly than the overall population. Thus, its share of the population will increase to 19% in 2050, from 12% in 2005. Patients with diseases that were once life threatening are now being treated with specialized medical care and an arsenal of new pharmaceuticals. Advances in research, diagnostics, surgical procedures, pharmaceuticals and a focus on healthier lifestyles have led to people living longer. Finally, we believe that with the arrival of healthcare reform in the United States, we and our tenants and operators will experience a significant increase in the demand for medical services.

Business Strategy 

We seek to protect and enhance our stockholders' value by creating stable, reliable and growing income streams generated through the ownership of a balanced and diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate. Our investment strategy is guided by three core principles: (1) maintaining a balanced, well diversified portfolio of high quality assets; (2) pursuing accretive and opportunistic investment opportunities; and (3) maintaining a strong and flexible capital structure. 

Maintaining a Balanced, Well Diversified Portfolio of High Quality Assets 

We seek balance and diversity within our portfolio. This extends to tenancy, geography, operator/managers and payors within our investment focus of medical office buildings and seniors housing communities. However, we may also invest in various other properties that serve as part of the healthcare delivery system, including properties occupied by healthcare providers, payors, researchers, pharmaceutical firms and manufacturers. 

The following table lists the tenants (including for this purpose, all affiliates of such tenants) whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis represented 10% or more of consolidated annualized rental income for all properties on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

Investing in Healthcare-related Facilities 

Healthcare-related facilities include MOBs and outpatient facilities, seniors housing communities, such as assisted and independent living and memory care facilities, as well as hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care centers, surgery centers, skilled nursing facilities, specialty medical and diagnostic facilities, research laboratories and pharmaceutical buildings. 

Medical Office Building and Outpatient Facilities 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 81 &#32;MOBs and outpatient facilities totaling 3.2 million &#32;square feet. These facilities typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic imaging centers, rehabilitation clinics and ambulatory surgery centers. These facilities can be located on or near hospital campuses and require significant plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate diagnostic imaging equipment such as x-rays or other imaging equipment, and may also have significant plumbing to accommodate physician exam rooms. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain specialized construction such as cancer radiation therapy vaults for cancer treatment. 

There are a variety of types of MOBs: on campus, off campus, affiliated and non-affiliated. On campus MOBs are physically located on a hospital's campus, often on land leased from the hospital. A hospital typically creates strong tenant demand which leads to high tenant retention. Off campus properties are located independent of a hospital's location. Affiliated MOBs may be located on campus or off campus, but are affiliated with a hospital or health system. In some respects, affiliated MOBs are similar to on campus MOBs because the hospital relationship drives tenant demand and retention. Finally, non-affiliated MOBs are not affiliated with any hospital or health system, but may contain physician offices and other healthcare services. We favor affiliated MOBs versus non-affiliated MOBs because of the relationship and synergy with the sponsoring hospital or health system. 

The following table reflects the on campus, off campus, affiliated and non-affiliated MOB composition of our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 :

Seniors Housing Communities 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 38 &#32;seniors housing communities under a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ("RIDEA"), our seniors housing &#8212; operating properties ("SHOP") segment, and 20 &#32;seniors housing communities under long term leases, which are included within our triple net leased healthcare facilities segment. Under RIDEA, a REIT may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arm's length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. Seniors housing communities include independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and memory care facilities. These communities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs and need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Our seniors housing communities primarily consist of assisted living, memory care and independent living units. 

Assisted Living and Memory Care Facilities 

Assisted living facilities ("ALFs") are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. ALFs are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer a separate facility that provides a higher level of care for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. As of December 31, 2015 , our seniors housing assets included 2,352 &#32;assisted living units and 1,237 &#32;memory care units. 

Independent Living Facilities 

Independent living facilities are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living, however, in some of our facilities, residents have the option to contract for these services. As of December 31, 2015 , our seniors housing assets included 935 &#32;independent living units. 

Hospitals, Post-Acute Care and Other Facilities 

Our hospitals, post-acute care and other facilities are leased to tenants that provide healthcare services. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 27 &#32;other healthcare-related assets, including hospitals and post-acute care facilities. Hospitals can include general acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals and surgical and specialty hospitals. These facilities provide inpatient diagnosis and treatment, both medical and surgical, and provide a broad array of inpatient and outpatient services including surgery, rehabilitation therapy as well as diagnostic and treatment services. Post-acute facilities offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial care for people not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at acute care hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy, as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis. Inpatient rehabilitation services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Pursuing Accretive and Opportunistic Investment Opportunities 

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future which will be accretive to our earnings and will generate attractive returns to our stockholders. We invest in medical office buildings, seniors housing and certain other healthcare real estate primarily through acquisitions, although we may also do so through development and joint venture partnerships. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor's/partner's management team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building, its age and location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry. We conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition. 

We monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal asset managers actively manage and monitor the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions among other things. In monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends. 

As of March 4, 2016 , we had $49.0 million &#32;of assets under contract and executed letters of intent. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreements and letters of intent, our obligation to close upon these acquisitions is subject to certain conditions customary to closing, including the successful completion of due diligence and fully negotiated binding agreements. There can be no assurance that we will complete these acquisitions. We intend to use advances from our Credit Facility to fund acquisitions (see " Note 5 &#160;&#8212; Credit Facility " of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our Credit Facility). 

Primary Investment Focus 

We have invested, and expect to continue investing, primarily in MOBs and seniors housing communities. In addition we may invest in facilities leased to hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, long-term acute care centers, surgery centers, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, special medical and diagnostic service providers, laboratories, research firms, pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers and health insurance firms. We generally acquire a fee interest in any property we acquire (a "fee interest" is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although we may also acquire a leasehold interest (a "leasehold interest" is a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease). We have and may continue to acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property. We also may make preferred equity investments in an entity. 

We have, and may in the future, enter into management agreements with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by RIDEA. Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease "qualified healthcare properties" on an arm's length basis to a TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points with long term growth prospects or drive growth by: (i) transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale, operating efficiencies, or ancillary services; or (ii) investing capital to reposition the asset. 

A smaller part of our business may involve originating or acquiring loans secured by or related to the same types of properties in which we may invest directly. Likewise, we may invest in securities of publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. For example, we may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire these securities. Examples of loans we may invest in include, but are not limited to, investments in first, second and third mortgage loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property and loans on leasehold interest mortgages. We also may invest in participations in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans unsecured loans. 

Maintaining a Strong and Flexible Capital Structure 

We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund our investment activity. Our debt and equity levels are determined by management in consultation with our board of directors. For short-term purposes, we may borrow from our senior secured line of credit arrangement. We may replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior secured or unsecured notes or other forms of longer term financing. We may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness, which we assume as part of the acquisition. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015 , our secured debt leverage ratio (total secured debt divided by total assets) was approximately 25.9% &#32;and we had total secured borrowings of $589.5 million &#32;and no unsecured borrowings. 

Tax Status 

We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

Competition 

The market for MOBs, seniors housing and other healthcare-related real estate is highly competitive. We compete in all of our markets based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire, tenants to occupy our properties and purchasers to buy our properties. These competitors include other REITs, private investment funds, specialty finance companies, institutional investors, pension funds and their advisors and other entities. There are also other REITs, including American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc. ("HT III"), which is indirectly sponsored by AR Global, with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours, and others may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels. 

Healthcare Regulation 

Overview 

The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, the False Claims Act and similar state laws. We may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore our business. Our tenants and operators are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants&#8217; and operators&#8217; failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants and operators may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us. 

Licensure, Certification and Certificate of Need 

Our tenants operate hospitals, assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursement for services from third-party payors, such as the government-sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers. Participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs generally requires the operators of a healthcare facility to be licensed and certified and be subject to compliance surveys. In granting and renewing these licenses and certifications, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a facility&#8217;s operations, including, but not limited to, the plant and physical structure, admission and discharge standards, staffing, training, patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines and other rules. The failure of an operator to maintain or renew any required license, certification or other regulatory approval or to correct serious deficiencies identified in compliance surveys could prevent it from continuing operations at a facility. A loss of licensure or certification or change in participation status could also adversely affect an operator's ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases with us. In addition, if we have to replace an operator, we may experience difficulties in finding a replacement because our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws governing changes in control and ownership. 

Similarly, in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, our hospitals must meet the applicable conditions of participation established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") relating to the type of hospital and its equipment, personnel and standard of medical care, as well as comply with state and local laws and regulations. Hospitals undergo periodic on-site licensure surveys, which generally are limited if the hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (formerly the Joint commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) or other recognized accreditation organizations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a hospital's ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases with us. 

Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to various state certificate of need ("CON") laws requiring governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment or introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict an operator's ability to expand our properties and grow its business in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on the operator's revenues and, in turn, its ability to make rental payments under, and otherwise comply with the terms of, its leases with us. 

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement 

Various federal and state laws and regulations are aimed at actions that may constitute fraud and abuse by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from or make or receive referrals in connection with government-funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The federal laws include, for example, the following: 

&#8226; 

The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) which prohibits certain business practices and relationships, including the payment, receipt or solicitation of any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce a referral of any patient or service or item covered by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; 

The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred as the "Stark Law"), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or certain other financial arrangements; 

&#8226; 

The False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and 

&#8226; 

The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes HHS to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent acts. 

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on operators to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to, or more expansive than, the federal anti-fraud and abuse laws and have also adopted laws that increase patient protections, such as minimum staffing levels, criminal background checks, and restrictions on the use and disclosure of health information. 

In the ordinary course of their business, the operators at our properties are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Increased funding for investigation and enforcement efforts accompanied by an increased pressure to eliminate government waste has led to a significant increase in the number of investigations and enforcement actions over the past several years. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud through qui tam lawsuits filed by whistleblowers has also increased. 

Violations of federal or state law by an operator of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the operator's liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. Federal and state fraud and abuse laws may also restrict the terms of our rental agreements with our tenants. 

Privacy and Security of Health Information 

Various federal and state laws protect the privacy and security of health information. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, its implementing regulations and related federal laws and regulations (commonly referred to as "HIPAA") protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure. Many states have implemented similar laws to limit the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. Violations of federal and state privacy and security laws could have a material adverse effect on the operator&#8217;s financial condition or operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. 

Reimbursement 

The reimbursement methodologies for healthcare facilities are constantly changing and federal and state authorities may implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact healthcare operations. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "Affordable Care Act") enacted certain reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates for various healthcare providers, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, reduced the inflation-adjusted market based increase included in standard federal payment rates for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, long-term care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. In addition, under the Affordable Care Act, long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities are subject to a rate adjustment to the market basket increase to reflect improvements in productivity. Accordingly, current and future payments under federal and state healthcare programs may not be sufficient to sustain a facility&#8217;s operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. 

Federal and state budget pressures also continue to escalate, and in an effort to address actual or potential budget shortfalls, Congress and many state legislatures may enact reductions to Medicare and Medicaid expenditures through cuts in rates paid to providers or restrictions in eligibility and benefits. 

Certain of our facilities are also subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by governmental authorities, which could result in recoupments, denials, or delay of payments. Recoupment of past payments or denial or delay of future payments could adversely affect an operator&#8217;s ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under, and otherwise complying with the terms of, its leases and other agreements with us. 

We regularly assess the financial implications of reimbursement rule changes on our tenants, but we cannot assure you that current rules or future updates will not materially adversely affect our operators and tenants, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on their ability to pay rent and other obligations to us. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Healthcare Industry Risks - Reductions or changes in reimbursement from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors - Healthcare Industry Risks - A reduction in Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities may have an adverse effect on the Medicare reimbursements received by certain of our tenants&#8221; included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Environmental Regulations 

As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel, oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Even with respect to properties that we do not operate or manage, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property's value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release. 

Under the terms of our lease and management agreements, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants, operators and managers of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, we cannot assure you that our tenants, operators and managers will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any such inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims. 

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2015 and do not expect that we will be required to make any such material capital expenditures during 2016. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had no employees. Instead, the employees of our Advisor and other affiliates of our Sponsor performed a full range of services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, transfer agent and investor relations services. We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves by hiring our own workforce or obtaining such services from an unrelated party at potentially higher costs.
