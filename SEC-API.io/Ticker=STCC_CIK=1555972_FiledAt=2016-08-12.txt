Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada as Oceanview Acquisition Corp on January 31, 2011. On May 18, 2012, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Sterling Consolidated Corp (the &#8220;Company&#8221;). We are a holding company, and all of our operations are conducted through our four subsidiaries: Sterling Seal &#38; Supply, Inc. (&#8220;Sterling Seal&#8221;), ADDR Properties, LLC (&#8220;ADDR&#8221;), Q5 Ventures, LLC (&#8220;Q5&#8221;), and Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation (&#8220;Integrity&#8221;). In June 2012, these four entities became subsidiaries of the Company through an Equity Exchange Agreement by which the shareholders of Sterling Seal, ADDR, Q5, and Integrity became shareholders of the Company and in exchange the Company received all of the authorized and outstanding shares of Sterling Seal, ADDR, Q5, and Integrity. We issued a total of 33,817,040 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Sterling Seal, ADDR, Q5 and Integrity.

&#160;

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Sterling Consolidated Corp. conducts its entire business through its four subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is responsible for a specific business function of the Company. For clarity, an organizational chart of the Company is provided below.

&#160;

&#160;

Sterling Seal &#38; Supply, Inc. 

&#160;

Our largest subsidiary is Sterling Seal, a New Jersey corporation which was incorporated in 1997. Its predecessor was Sterling Plastic &#38; Rubber Products, Inc., which was incorporated in New Jersey and was founded in 1970. Sterling Seal engages primarily in the distribution and sale of O-rings, rubber seals, oil seals, custom molded rubber parts, custom Teflon parts, Teflon rods, O-ring cord, bonded seals, O-ring kits, and stuffing box sealant.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

Sterling Seal is a distributor of O-rings. O-rings are one of the simplest, yet most engineered, precise, and useful seal designs. They are one of the most common and important elements of machine design. O-rings and the other products that Sterling Seal sells are used in a wide variety of industries, including automotive, pump, transmissions, oil and energy, machinery, and packaging. These products are utilized primarily as seals to prevent leakage of liquids or air. Most of the products carried by Sterling Seal are made of rubber, but some are coated and the rubber compound can change upon customer request.

&#160;

Sterling Seal sells directly to smaller distributors and original equipment manufacturers in need of seals. It offers a catalogue of standard sizes, and will take orders for special sizes not available in the standard catalogue. In order to satisfy the needs of our customers and stay competitive, Sterling Seal always maintains a wide variety of products in substantial quantities at its main warehouse in Neptune, New Jersey, as well as its other facilities in the United States. The products that we hold in inventory at our warehouse are standard products that are most often ordered. If a customer orders a product that is not in our inventory, we order the product from one of our suppliers in China.

&#160;

We have approximately 3,300 customers that place orders with us for the delivery of O-ring or similar products. Our largest customer is a southeastern U.S. manufacturer/distributor of automotive/industrial products. Other automotive customers are Precision International, Fruedenberg and Sonnax Transmissions. We stock a variety of rubber seals to service pool filter and pump manufacturers. We also distribute our products to many resellers of replacement parts and pool stores. Bay State Pool and Horizon Pool and Spa are two of our larger accounts in the pool industry.

&#160;

A large portion of our customer base services the plumbing and industrial industries. These accounts include, Fastenal, Kaman Industrial and Eastern Industrial. They are localized to service a wide range of products, but they purchase O-Rings and rubber seals from Sterling.

&#160;

Sterling Seal receives requests for quotations electronically and by fax daily from its various customers. The sales force then reviews each request, and responds with a &#8220;quoted&#8221; price for delivery and price. If such a quote is accepted, the customer responds with a purchase order for a specific price and delivery.

&#160;

After a purchase order is accepted and we do not have the ordered product in our inventory, we then contact one of our suppliers. All of our suppliers are located in China. In determining which suppliers to use, we look for suppliers that deliver quality products in a timely manner. We do not have any long term contracts with any of our suppliers. The following is the list of our 10 largest principal suppliers:

&#160;

- Progum Elastomer Technology Co., Ltd. - Ivy Seals Group Corp. - Ge Mao Rubber Ind. Co. - Escort Seals - Rubber Best Industry Corp. - Wyatt Seal, Inc. - Best Ring Industrial - Supaseal Ltd. - Goodway Rubber Ind Co Ltd - AnySeals, Inc. &#160;

O-ring and rubber seals are generally considered commodities, meaning that such goods are fungible and there is little if any distinction between the various producers and suppliers of the products. None of the products sold by Sterling Seal are under patent and there are no intellectual property or licensing issues. Sterling Seal sets itself apart from other similarly situated companies though the variety and quality of its inventory, the price point at which it sells its various products, and its ability to deliver products to customers on time. The time it takes us to deliver the ordered product to a customer will mainly depend on whether we have it in inventory or need to order it from a supplier in China. If we have it in inventory, we can package, ship and distribute the product within two (2) business days.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

When orders arrive at Sterling Seal, we ship the products to our customer and invoice on a 45-day basis.

&#160;

Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation 

&#160; 

Our subsidiary, Integrity, is a freight forwarding business. They are primarily responsible for transporting products we order from our suppliers back to our warehouse in Neptune, NJ. After Sterling Seal confirms from its supplier that a product is ready to be picked up, Integrity Cargo is responsible for picking up the products and getting them to the dock and delivered to the Sterling Seal warehouse.

&#160;

Integrity shares a facility with Sterling Seal and manages the importation of Sterling Seal&#8217;s products and its exports to various countries. Currently eighty percent (80%) of Sterling Seal&#8217;s imports come from Asia, and ten percent (10%) of the Company&#8217;s sales are exported to various countries. However, all payables are billed and collected in USD, so Sterling Seal does not bear any foreign exchange risk on open payables.

&#160;

We incorporated Integrity in order to vertically integrate our operations and not have to rely on third parties to deliver our products from the supplier. This has resulted in quicker delivery and more predictable delivery times.

&#160;

This provides the Company with a competitive advantage over other importers of O-rings and seals as we can utilize our own freight company and consolidate our operations. As a result, the Company is able to provide lower prices to its customers. This also provides us with a much greater level of control over our shipping, which expedites lead times and deliveries to our customers.

&#160;

Entering the freight forwarding market has provided the Company with a competitive advantage as compared with other importing distributors of rubber O-Rings. By having the ability to utilize our own freight company, we are able to consolidate shipments from various sources and ship as frequently as needed, which has resulted in improved efficiencies and delivery times.

&#160;

Integrity also performs freight forwarding services for third party customers. Integrity currently has about twenty (20) customers for whom performs freight forwarding services. However, roughly fifty percent (50%) of its revenues derive from freight forwarding for Sterling Seal.

&#160;

Integrity shares a facility and certain overhead costs such as information technology with Sterling Seal, so both entities have lower operational costs due to economies of scale.

&#160; 

ADDR Properties, LLC. 

&#160; 

ADDR is one of our two subsidiaries that owns real property. ADDR owns a 28,000 square foot facility in Neptune, NJ. Roughly ninety percent (90%) of this property is used by Sterling Seal as its principal executive office and primary warehouse. The Company does not pay rent to ADDR for the use of this facility. The remaining 3,000 square feet of this facility is rented out to the Children&#8217;s Center of Monmouth County.

&#160;

Q5 Ventures, LLC 

&#160;

Q5 owns a 5,000 square foot facility in Apopka, Florida, which is used by Sterling Seal for its Florida operations. This facility was specifically built for Sterling Seal&#8217;s operations. Sterling Seal does not pay rent to Q5.

&#160;

Competition and Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

Rubber is the raw material that we are dependent on in our business. In order to compete in the US, a supplier must import from China. This is due to the fact that manufacturing rubber is a labor intensive project and labor costs are significantly cheaper in China than they are in the United States.

&#160;

There is a lot of competition in the US for seals and products that we distribute. In order to establish competitive prices, we purchase large quantities of product at a time. It would be too costly for smaller companies or our customers to circumvent us by buying directly from the supplier because the prices are much higher for smaller orders. Importation costs are also high and add to the overall cost of the product.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

This is a competitive advantage for us because we are a larger company that has the cash and other resources that enables us to hold inventory at our warehouse. This helps us maintain a competitive advantage because not only do we have the ability of reducing our costs, we can also decrease the amount of time it takes to deliver orders to our customers, provided that we have the product in our warehouse. Stockpiling inventory also requires capital. Currently, we have over two million dollars in inventory to service our current customers&#8217; demands.

&#160;

For some of our customers, there is a cost incurred as a result of switching from Sterling Seal as a supplier. Because Sterling Seal is an approved supplier for many of our industrial and commercial customers, while other suppliers may not be approved, our customers could face increased costs as a result of switching to another supplier's product. For certain customers, in order to switch from an approved supplier, the product must be tested and approved. In the automotive industry the factories have to be audited and approved in addition to the distributor and their products. Because of the potential for increasing costs, our current customers are unlikely to abandon us.

&#160;

In addition, many of our customers place small orders throughout the year. It takes a long time to build the business to cover overhead costs. For this reason, it is difficult for a supplier to enter into our industry. Most of Sterling Seal&#8217;s accounts are repeat customers with consistent demands for O-rings and custom-molded rubber.

&#160;

Once we have the product in our warehouse, either if it is already in inventory or if we just received the shipment of the product from China, the Company is able to cost-effectively distribute products to local markets across the United States within two (2) business days because we have established multiple distribution factories over the course of our years of operating. This helps to expedite deliveries and reduce costs. This also gives us an advantage over our competitors. In addition, the vertical integration of our freight forwarding business, Integrity, with our primary operations through Sterling Seal helps us deliver products more cost-effectively.

&#160;

We currently have relationships with domestic and international distributors. The Company intends to increase sales through acquisitions and investing in complementary corporations.

&#160;

Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business 

&#160;

We do not experience much seasonality or cyclical nature to our business. Our sales are consistent from month to month. However, we do experience a slight increase in volume at the beginning of the year because most of our customers have a budget and cash available to purchase products for the entire year. Also, during the summer months our sales are a little slower due to factory shutdowns and increased vacations by purchasing agents.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

&#160; 

We have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis.

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities and Costs 

&#160;

We are a supplier and distributor of products and, therefore, do not incur any research and development and have no plans to undertake any research and development activities during the next year of operations.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are not aware of the need for any governmental approvals of our products. Since we utilize contract manufacturers, regulations will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturers. Before entering into any manufacturing contract we determine that the manufacturer has met all government requirements.

&#160; 

Environmental Laws (federal, state and local) 

&#160;

We do not believe that we will be subject to any environmental laws either state or federal. Any laws concerning manufacturing and shipping will be the responsibility of the contract manufacturer.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

We currently have relationships with several companies located in the United States and overseas. The Company markets its products primarily through word of mouth and referrals from its customers. We attend several trade shows during the course of the year specifically to market our products. We routinely attend the SEMA show in Las Vegas, NV which is one of the largest supplier shows of its kind for the automotive market. In addition, we supply distributors and end users with the product necessary for steering wheels and transmissions kits. Our largest customer is Freudenberg who sells replacements kits to John Deer and Harley Davidson, amongst many other companies. Other automotive customers are Precision International and Sonnax Transmissions. 

&#160;

Another trade show is the Atlantic City Pool and Spa show. We stock a variety of rubber seals to service the pool filter and pump manufacturers. We also distribute our products to many resellers of replacement parts and pool stores. Bay State Pool and Horizon Pool and Spa are two of our larger accounts in the pool industry.

&#160;

A large portion of our customer base services the plumbing and industrial industries. These accounts include, Fastenal, Kaman Industrial and Eastern Industrial. They are localized to service a wide range of products, but they purchase O-Rings and rubber seals from Sterling Seal.

&#160;

The marketing for ADDR and Q5, specifically the location of tenants, is through real estate agents. The current agent of record for both companies is Sheldon Gross Realty, 80 Main Street, West Orange, New Jersey.

&#160;

Integrity markets through direct sales and referrals only.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of August 5, we have 26 full time employees. Our employees consist of: (i) salespersons; (ii) management and administrative; and (iii) warehouse and shipping operators.
