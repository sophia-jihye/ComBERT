GENERAL

&#160;

Agro Capital Management Corp. (&#8220;Agro Capital&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) formerly known as Guate Tourism Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 12, 2013. Until September 11, 2015, the Company operated an online tourist guide company in Guatemala helping public from all over the World to find the best accommodation/restaurant/tour/city/program etc. depending on their budget and interests. On September 11, 2015, the Company underwent a change of control, which was the result of the Company&#8217;s largest shareholder, Ms. Blanca Bamaca, resigning as an officer and director and selling in a private transaction 6 million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, which represented 82.8% of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. 

Subsequently, we have abandoned our prior business plan and have entered into a new business enterprise. On December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement whereby it agreed to issue 30 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Agro Capital Management Berhad, a Malaysian corporation (the &#8220;Agro Malay&#8221;). The Company closed its acquisition of the Agro Malay on April 30, 2016. The business of Agro Capital is to now manage, expand, develop and own Agro Malay.

Agro Malay is principally engaged in aquaculture development in Malaysia. Its core business is in the trading, exporting and production of aquaculture related products. Agro Malaysia has also been appointed as the management partner of several joint venture projects with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Malaysia, to operate existing aquaculture infrastructure projects in Malaysia.

In October 2015, Agro Malay was awarded with a 40.47-hectare (ha) farmland in Sungai Miang, Pekan for a concessionary aquaculture project in Pahang. The land, which is part a 108.46-ha aquaculture project in the area, was awarded by Rumpun Timur Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of the Pahang State Development Corporation. The award was an addition to the existing 20.23-ha Agro Malay has within the same aquaculture project area, bringing the company&#8217;s total land size in Pekan to 60.7-ha.

&#160;

We anticipate commercially farming marine shrimp for export and distribution to local retailers.

&#160;

&#160;

Aquaculture is increasingly becoming a way to produce marine fish and shellfish in through sustainable methods for consumption and export, without causing additional strain to natural seafood populations.

We recognise the need to help meet increasing market demands for seafood, and hence, will continue our efforts to develop sustainable methods of cultivation in a cost-effective manner.

We intend to expand Agro Malay into a fully-integrated aquaculture company in the future by developing our own research and development, hatcheries, aquaculture feeds, grow-out operations, processing plant operations, seafood sales and marketing.
