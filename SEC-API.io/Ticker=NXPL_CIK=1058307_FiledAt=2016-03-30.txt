 Item 1. Business 

Corporate History 

On January 22, 2015, the Company changed its name to &#8220;Orbital Tracking Corp.&#8221; from &#8220;Great West Resources, Inc.&#8221; pursuant to a merger with a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary. 

On March 28, 2014, the Company merged with a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company solely for the purpose of changing its state of incorporation to Nevada from Delaware, effecting a 1:150 reverse split of its common stock, and changing its name to Great West Resources, Inc. in connection with the plans to enter into the business of potash mining and exploration. During late 2014, the Company abandoned its efforts to enter the potash business. 

&#160; 

The Company was originally incorporated in 1997 as a Florida corporation. On April 21, 2010, the Company merged with and into a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary for the purpose of changing its state of incorporation to Delaware, effecting a 2:1 forward split of its common stock, and changing its name to EClips Media Technologies, Inc. On April 25, 2011, the Company changed its name to &#8220;Silver Horn Mining Ltd.&#8221; pursuant to a merger with a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary. 

Global Telesat Communications Limited (&#8220;GTCL&#8221;) was formed under the laws of England and Wales in 2008. On February 19, 2015, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with GTCL and all of the holders of the outstanding equity of GTCL pursuant to which GTCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition and has been treated as a recapitalization of Orbital Tracking Corp. with Global Telesat Communications Limited considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer became the financial statements of the registrant. The completion of the Share Exchange resulted in a change of control. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and re-capitalization. The GTCL Shareholders obtained approximately 39% of voting control on the date of Share Exchange. GTCL was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Orbital Tracking Corp. was the acquired company. The consolidated financial statements after the acquisition include the balance sheets of both companies at historical cost, the historical results of GTCL and the results of the Company from the acquisition date. All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retroactively restated to reflect the recapitalization. 

&#160; 

Our Current Business 

The Company is a provider of satellite-based hardware, airtime, mapping and related services both in the United States, through its Orbital Satcom subsidiary, and internationally through its UK based subsidiary, GTCL. We sell equipment and airtime for use on all of the major satellite networks including Globalstar, Inmarsat, Iridium and Thuraya and operate a short-term rental service for customers who desire to use our equipment for a limited time period. Our acquisition of GTCL in February 2015 expanded our global satellite based infrastructure and business, which was first launched in December 2014 through the purchase of certain contracts which entitle us to use airtime on one of the world&#8217;s largest commercial satellite networks at preferential rates. 

Through GTCL, we believe we are one of the largest providers in Europe of retail satellite based hardware, airtime and services through various ecommerce storefronts, and one of the largest providers of personal satellite tracking devices. Our customers include more than 12,000 businesses, U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and private consumers all over the world. By enabling wireless communications in areas not served or underserved by terrestrial wireless or in circumstances where terrestrial networks are not operational due to natural or man-made disasters, we seek to meet our customers' increasing desire for connectivity. Our principal focus is on growing our existing satellite based hardware, airtime and related services business line, specifically services attracting recurring revenue for the Company, and developing our own tracking devices for use by retail customers worldwide. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We operate two e-commerce websites, which offer a range of portable satellite voice, data and tracking solutions, known as Mobile Satellite Services or MSS. The e-commerce website operated by our US based Orbital Satcom subsidiary was launched in April 2015 and is due to be relaunched in the 3 rd quarter of 2016 on a mobile friendly platform. Our UK subsidiary, GTCL, relaunched a new mobile friendly website in February 2016. These two sites attract customers and enquiries from potential customers from all around the world and we ship globally to customers every day who have found us through these websites. We plan to develop additional country-specific websites or offer translation options on our existing websites to target customers in South America, Asia and Europe where we anticipate there will be substantial demand for our products. 

&#160; 

MSS Products 

Our MSS products include handheld satellite phones, personal and asset tracking devices, portable high speed broadband terminals, satellite Wi-Fi hotspots, and associated mapping services, all of which work virtually anywhere in the world. These devices rely on satellite networks and thus are not reliant on cell towers or other local infrastructure. As a result, satellite phones and these other MSS solutions are suitable for recreational travelers and adventurers, government and military users, and corporations and individuals in the event of an emergency such as a power outage, hurricane or other natural disaster during which regular cell phone, telephone and internet service may not be available. We purchase these products directly from the manufacturers or distribution partners and sell them directly to end users and a growing base of resellers that we have around the world. 

Satellite Telecommunications Services 

As a result of the purchase of the contracts from Global Telesat Corp. (&#8220;GTC&#8221;) in December 2014, we commenced providing mobile voice and data communications services globally via satellite over Globalstar&#8217;s satellite based simplex data network. We provide this service through our Orbital Satcom subsidiary. Our rights under the purchased contracts allow us to have preferred pricing arrangements with Globalstar for each account used during the term of contracts. We then offer our customers a range of pay-as-you-go and monthly fee satellite communications airtime options. 

&#160;

The simplex service is a one-way burst data transmission from a commercial simplex device over the Globalstar network that can be used to track and monitor assets. We can use each simplex or one-way transmission account to transmit an unlimited number of locational or status messages from tracking devices used anywhere within the Globalstar simplex coverage area. At the heart of the simplex service is a demodulator and RF interface, called an applique, which is located at a gateway and an application server located in Globalstar&#8217;s facilities. The applique-equipped gateways provide coverage over vast areas of the globe. The server receives and collates messages from all simplex devices transmitting over the Globalstar network. Simplex devices consist of a telemetry unit, an application specific sensor, a battery and optional global positioning functionality. The small size of the devices makes them attractive for use in tracking asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets, trailer tracking and mobile security. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Aside from providing services over Globalstar&#8217;s simplex data network, we are, through GTCL and Orbital Satcom, an authorized reseller of Globalstar&#8217;s two-way voice and data transmissions service, called the duplex service, and simplex and duplex satellite telecommunications services offered by other leading networks such as Iridium, Inmarsat and Thuraya. We offer a range of pay-as-you-go and monthly fee satellite communications airtime options from these network providers. We typically pay the network providers a monthly access fee per subscriber, as well as usage fees for airtime minutes used by our subscribers. This is a rapidly growing market and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this growth. Our customers are in industries such as maritime, aviation, government/military, emergency/humanitarian services, mining, forestry, oil and gas, heavy equipment, transportation and utilities as well as recreational users. We are focused on growing and diversifying our customer base beyond US government customers and making maximum use of our preferred pricing arrangements with Globalstar to generate increased revenue. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Amazon Storefronts 

We make portable satellite voice, data and tracking solutions easier to find and buy online through our Amazon storefronts. We currently have storefronts on Amazon.com in the US, and many other Amazon sites including the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Japan and Canada. We have invested in personnel to translate our listings correctly in the different countries we are represented in and are regularly improving and increasing our listings on all Amazon sites. We currently have more than 1,600 product listings on all Amazon sites and invest in inventory to hold at Amazon&#8217;s various warehouses around the world to ensure that orders are shipped and received by customers as quickly as possible. The products include handheld satellite phones, personal and asset tracking devices, portable high speed broadband terminals, and satellite Wi-Fi hotspots. We expect to open more Amazon storefronts before the end of 2016. 

&#160; 

Mapping and Tracking Portal 

Our advanced mapping and tracking portals, www.orbitaltrack.com offered by Orbital Satcom, and www.gtctrack.com offered by GTCL, have been developed by us and are available for use by registered customers. OrbitalTrack and GTCTrack display real-time worldwide asset location reports including position, speed, altitude and heading and also provides past location and movement history reports on a wide range of tracking devices. These mapping portals are available to all of our customers to monitor their assets and we intend to aggressively pursue new customers for this application. 

&#160;

Proprietary Satellite Tracking Products 

We have developed our first own brand global tracking product, a dual-mode asset tracker, which will be available in the marketplace later this year following final testing and receipt of necessary regulatory and compatibility certifications. The Company&#8217;s dual-mode asset tracker was designed to address the current technical and service cost challenges facing the global Asset Management Systems market, a market growing at a 20.5% compound annual growth rate and estimated to reach a value of $18.87 billion by 2020 according to research by Market and Markets. The first product designed and developed by the Company, the dual-mode tracker utilizes both cellular and satellite technology to provide truly global tracking, automatically switching between the cellular and satellite links making it an ideal solution for use in both populated and remote areas, including trans-oceanic routes. For commercial users in transportation, shipping, logistics, fleet management and construction, it features detailing reporting alerts, status and GPS location data allowing cargo and vehicles to be tracked nearly anywhere in the world while lowering operating costs by utilizing cellular when available and satellite in remote areas, optimizing roaming charges and delivering significant cost savings. 

We anticipate that we will be able to develop and certify the new dual-mode tracker for approximately $50,000 to $75,000 and believe there is strong customer demand based on existing customer requests. 

&#160;

We also intend to develop additional personal and asset tracking products suitable for government and recreational users. Users of these devices will be able to see the location and movements of their devices through our OrbitalTrack or GTCTrack portals. Anticipated costs for completion are approximately $75,000 to $100,000. These products will operate on the Iridium, Inmarsat, Globalstar and Thuraya satellite networks. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Industry and Market 

&#160; 

We compete in the mobile satellite products and services sector of the global communications industry. The products and airtime that we sell are intended to meet users&#8217; needs for connectivity in all locations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks do not exist, do not provide sufficient coverage, or are impaired. Government organizations, including military and intelligence agencies and disaster response agencies, non-governmental organizations and industrial operations and support teams depend on mobile voice and data satellite communications products and services on a regular basis. Businesses with global operations require reliable communications services when operating in remote locations around the world. Mobile satellite services users span many sectors, including emergency services, maritime, aviation, government, utilities, oil and gas, mining, recreation, forestry, heavy equipment, construction, and transportation, among others. Many of our customers view satellite communications products and services as critical to their daily operations. 

&#160; 

There is an existing, and we believe significantly growing, multi-billion dollar global market for a small and cost effective solution for receiving and processing mobile voice and data communications from remote locations used in applications such as tracking vehicles or asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets or mobile security. Over the past two decades, the global mobile satellite services market has experienced significant growth. Increasingly, better-tailored, improved-technology products and services are creating new channels of demand for mobile satellite services. Growth in demand for mobile satellite voice services is driven by the declining cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower costs of the devices, as well as heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals for ubiquitous global voice and data coverage. We believe our solutions are ideally suited for industries such as maritime, aviation, government/military, emergency/humanitarian services, mining, forestry, oil and gas, heavy equipment, transportation and utilities, as well as recreational users. We do not tailor our products and services to different types of customers as in our experience military, non-profit, government and recreational users tend to purchase the same types of products and services. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The competitors for our satellite telecommunications services and products are other leading satellite networks such as Iridium, Inmarsat, Thuraya and Globalstar, and their various resellers such as Network Innovations, Applied Satellite Technology (AST) and Satcom Global, some of which are also our suppliers. We expect the competition for our satellite telecommunications services and our satellite tracking and monitoring services to increase significantly as the market demand accelerates. We believe that we will be well positioned to compete for the satellite telecommunications services business largely on a cost basis and due to our global presence with various websites and Amazon storefronts. We believe that we will be able to charge our customers lower prices for satellite airtime than our competitors due to the preferential pricing we have with Globalstar due to the Globalstar agreements. We believe that we will be able to compete in the MSS market due to our competitive pricing, varied products and easy to use website and Amazon storefront. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain our trade secrets. All of our employees and consultants are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. In connection with the purchase of the contracts from GTC and related agreements, GTC and its parent World Surveillance Group, Inc. agreed to keep confidential certain information. In February 2015 we purchased certain software, including source code and executable code, and electronic files required for the development of dual mode trackers. On October 13, 2015, we purchased 

appliques, which are demodulator and RF interfaces located at various ground stations for gateways. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Research and Development 

On February 19, 2015, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock, at $0.05 per share, or $50,000, to a consultant as compensation for the design and delivery of dual mode gsm/Globalstar Simplex tracking devices and related hardware and intellectual property. We spent $50,000 and $0, respectively, in the fiscal years ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 on research and development. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with our customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of any then existing contracts or the inability to bid on future contracts. We intend our Orbital Sub to become qualified as a government contractor. 

International sales of our products may also be subject to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and policies like the United States Department of State restrictions on the transfer of technology, International Traffic in Arms Regulation (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;) and other export laws and regulations and may be subject to first obtaining licenses, clearances or authorizations from various regulatory entities. This may limit our ability to sell our products abroad and the failure to comply with any of these regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues as well as increasing our operating costs. Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission that regulate wireless communications. 

&#160;

Sources and Availability of Components 

&#160;

&#160; 

Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom made for those products and are dependent upon either a single or limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement supplier&#8217;s components are inferior or unacceptable. 

Employees 

We currently have 8 full time and 1 part time employee, not including David Phipps, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Theresa Carlise, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Phipps and Ms. Carlise work for us full time.
