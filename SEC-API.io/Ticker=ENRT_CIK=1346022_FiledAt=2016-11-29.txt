Chronological Overview of our Business over the Last Five Years 

Upon our inception on November 24, 2004, we were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of natural resource properties. On April 6, 2005 we entered into an Exploration Agreement with Options for Joint Venture with Miranda U.S.A., Inc. We had the option of acquiring an undivided 60% interest in Miranda&#146;s lease in sixty-four mineral claims situated in Eureka County, Nevada. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007, we abandoned our option to acquire the 60% interest in the Eureka County mineral lease claims. 

Our management determined that the mineral exploration business did not present the best opportunity for our company to realize value for our shareholders at that time, and therefore investigated opportunities for our Company to enter the natural gas and oil exploration sector. Accordingly, we abandoned our previous business plan and focused on the exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties. 

On April 16, 2007, we acquired a 25% (net 15%) before payout (12.5% (net 7.5%)) after payout interest in Queensdale, Saskatchewan Project (known as the Queensdale Property) from 0743608 B.C. Ltd., a company controlled by a Director/CEO of our company, for a total cost of CAD$250,000 and 250,000 shares (post consolidation) of our common stock. 

On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common stock of Target Energy pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated October 15, 2007 among our company, as purchaser, and all of the shareholders of Target Energy, as vendors. In exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Target Energy, we issued to the shareholders of Target Energy an aggregate of 6,905,000 shares (post consolidation) of our common stock. Through our acquisition of Target Energy, we acquired an 8% gross interest before payout in the Queensdale, Queensdale West HZ 4A9-25/3A15-25-6-2 W2 well (known as the Queensdale West property). We also acquired a 3.75% net interest in two wells located in Wordsworth, Saskatchewan (known as the Wordsworth property), which had one well at the time of acquisition and eventually would see a second well drilled. 

On April 21, 2008, we acquired a passive minority interest in Pro Eco Energy USA Ltd., a private corporation focused on the installation and integration of alternative energy &#150; mainly solar thermal &#150; systems in Western Canada. 

On May 14, 2008, we acquired one land parcel of 160 acres in the Glen Park area of central Alberta, Canada. We subsequently entered into a 50/50 Joint Venture with Vanguard Exploration to explore and develop the joint lands on Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease No. 0408050364. The joint venture owns the Petroleum and Natural Gas rights below the base of the Mannville GRP to basement. 

On June 11, 2008, we acquired two land parcels of 160 acres each in the Glen Park area of central Alberta, Canada. These 320 acres were believed to be prospective for reef development and the potential accumulation of oil deposits. We own the Petroleum and Natural Gas rights below the base of the Mannville GRP to basement as to 100%. 

In November 2008, the Wordsworth property that had the second well was drilled and completed as a successful oil well in December 2008. 

On December 8, 2008, Enertopia and its partner were successful in acquiring 800 acres of land in the Coteau Lake project area and our company owned a 50% gross and net interest in a total of 2,080 acres of land in this area. 

On July 31, 2009, we sold all of our interests in the Queensdale, West Queensdale, and the Wordsworth properties for an aggregate amount of CAD$453,116. 

Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Cheetah Oil &#38; Gas Ltd. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 40.432% of an 8% share of Cheetah&#146;s net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP F-12-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Cheetah 57.76% of Cheetah&#146;s costs currently budgeted at $77,905.36, subject to revision and 57.76% of Cheetah&#146;s 8% share of PP F-12-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Cheetah Oil &#38; Gas Ltd, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah and 375,000 share purchase warrants which entitled our company to acquire 375,000 restricted common shares in the capital of Cheetah at a purchase price of US$0.20 per share for a period of two years. 

Effective September 1, 2009, we entered into an assignment agreement with Lexaria Corp. The assignment agreement dated August 28, 2009, provides for the purchase by our company of a revenue interest of 13.475% of a 32% share of Lexaria&#146;s net revenue after field operating expenses from the Belmont Lake PP F-12-4 horizontal well, located in Belmont Lake Field, Wilkinson County, Mississippi. As consideration, we agreed to pay to Lexaria 19.25% of Lexaria&#146;s costs currently budgeted at $311,621.44, subject to revision and 19.25% of Lexaria&#146;s 32% share of PP F-12-4 well costs from time to time for infrastructure, pipes, tanks, compressors, trucking, etc. On May 31, 2010, this assigned interest was converted into common shares and warrants of Lexaria Corp, leaving our company with no direct interest in this well. As a result, we have 499,893 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria and 499,983 share purchase warrants which entitle our company to acquire 499,983 restricted common shares in the capital of Lexaria at a purchase price of US$0.20 per share for a period of two years. 

Effective September 25, 2009, we effected a one (1) for two (2) share consolidation of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital decreased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 37,500,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares decreased from 29,305,480 shares of common stock to 14,652,740 shares of common stock. The consolidation became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on September 25, 2009 under the new stock symbol &#147;On October 9, 2009, we appointed Bal Bhullar as our chief financial officer.

On February 28, 2010, we entered into an Asset and Share Purchase Agreement with Mr. Mark Snyder to acquire up to 20% ownership interest of Global Solar Water Power Systems Inc. (&#147;GSWPS&#148;). Effective March 26, 2010, our stock quotation under the symbol &#147;GLCP&#148; was deleted from the OTC Bulletin Board. The symbol was deleted for factors beyond our company&#146;s control due to various market makers electing to shift their orders from the OTCBB to the Pink OTC Markets Inc. As a result of these market makers not providing a quote on the OTCBB for four consecutive days our company was deemed to be deficient in maintaining a listing standard at the OTCBB pursuant to Rule 15c2-11. That determination was made entirely without our company&#146;s knowledge. 

On April 7, 2010, FINRA confirmed the name change from Golden Aria Corp. to Enertopia Corp., and approved our new symbol "ENRT".

Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 360 &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of long-Lived Assets&#148;, we reclassified the remaining oil and gas properties to be sold as assets held for sale and recorded at their recoverable amount on August 31, 2010.

Summary 

The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful programs of development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. 

There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is significant uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional financing.
