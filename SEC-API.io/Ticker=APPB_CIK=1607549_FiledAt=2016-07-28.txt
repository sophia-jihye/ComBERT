 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

On February 28, 2014, Mr. Colin Povall, president and sole director, incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of March 31. FIRST FIXTURES, INC. is a company that intends to market and sell kitchen and bathroom fixtures online through its' intended website. Other than its President, the Company has no employees. We intend to contract with specialists to develop our logo and website, and contract with an Internet advertising and search engine specialist to assist us in development of our planned business. The Company has currently no arrangements or understandings in place with any specialists to develop our logo, to develop our website and to develop our planned business through Internet advertising and search engines. 

&#160;

FIRST FIXTURES, INC. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the company is no longer considered a shell company. 

&#160;

The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. It is the Company's intention to provide its customers with the quality kitchen and bathroom fixtures. The Company's target customers will be home builders or home owners that have an interest in home renovations. We intend to deploy current electronic marketing activities like Search Engine Optimization and online advertising. The Company intends to focus its marketing activities in North America. 

&#160;

The Company intends to provide home kitchen &#38; bathroom faucets and faucet handles manufactured by Zhejiang Momali Sanitary Utensils Co., Ltd., our potential supplier whospecializes in manufacturing spigot, sanitary material, and copper hardware components. Although our potential supplier has an "Add to Basket" on their website, there is no customer accessible "Check Out" function nor customer accessible "Payment" function" on our potential supplier's website. Therefore, we are of the opinion that potential First Fixtures customers cannot buy directly from our potential supplier. FIRST FIXTURES, INC. intends to market our planned products on the Internet.

Our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do and may use these resources to engage in aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. The current prevalence of aggressive advertising and promotion may generate pricing pressures to which we must respond. We expect that competition will continue to increase. We might not be able to compete with large company's if they where to drive prices down for bathroom fixtures. &#160;
