 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Through a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) relationship with Wuhan Kingold Jewelry Company Limited (&#8220;Wuhan Kingold&#8221;), a corporation incorporated in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;), we believe that we are one of the leading professional designers and manufacturers of high quality 24-karat gold jewelry and Chinese ornaments. We develop, promote and sell a broad range of products to the rapidly expanding jewelry market across the People&#8217;s Republic of China, or the PRC. We offer a wide range of in-house designed products including, but not limited to, gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, and pendants. We have built a partnership with the Jewelry Institute of China University of Geosciences to help us design new products.

&#160;

We have historically sold our products directly to distributors, retailers and other wholesalers, who then sell our products to consumers through retail counters located in both department stores and other traditional stand-alone jewelry stores. We sell our products to our customers at a price that reflects the market price of the base material, plus a mark-up reflecting our design fees and processing fees. Typically this mark-up is approximately ranges from 3% &#8211; 6% of the price of the base material. During 2015, we established a new subsidiary Wuhan Kingold Internet Co., Ltd. and started the online sales of our jewelry products to customers. However, the online sales were immaterial for 2015.

&#160;

We aim to become an increasingly important participant in the PRC&#8217;s gold jewelry design and manufacturing sector. In addition to expanding our design and manufacturing capabilities, our goal is to provide a large variety of gold products in unique styles and superior quality under our brand, Kingold.

&#160;

We have signed agreements with various leading banks in China such as the Bank of Communication and China Merchant Bank to sell gold bars and coins and other products through bank branches. The sales of the investment gold accounted for approximately 0.4% and 1.7 % of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Investment gold business in China has suffered a sharp decline in general since 2014 mainly due to declined demand resulting from the slowdown of China&#8217;s economy.

&#160;

To broaden our business lines and strengthen our processing capacity, in October 2013, we entered into an agreement to acquire the operating rights for 66,667 square meters (approximately 717,598 square feet, or 16.5 acres) of land in Wuhan for an aggregate purchase price of RMB 1 billion (approximately US $154 million at the spot rate). The $154 million include the land use right costs and the construction costs of the Jewelry Park as mentioned below. We financed the installment payments paid to date through bank loans, and may finance the remaining payments through either additional bank loans or other sources of financing. We may also finance part of the remaining payments through proceeds derived from the presale of some of the units. We have successfully obtained pre-sale permits for five of the seven buildings. The land use rights are held in the Shanghai Creative Industry Park, which we intend to rename the Kingold Jewelry Cultural Industry Park (the &#8220;Jewelry Park&#8221;). We intend to develop the land and to utilize the completed Jewelry Park as our new operation center and show center. We also plan to rent spaces within the Jewelry Park to other jewelry manufacturers and retailers in China, and may sell developed commercial and residential properties to individual and corporate buyers. The acquisition was structured as an equity purchase of the company holding the land use rights, with Wuhan Wansheng House Purchasing Limited (&#8220;Wuhan Wansheng&#8221;) (i) initially granting us a portion of ownership of Wuhan Huayuan Science and Technology Development Limited Company (&#8220;Wuhan Huayuan&#8221;), (ii) granting us the right to appoint the chief financial officer for the project to supervise and manage the use of funds, and (iii) naming Wuhan Wansheng as agent for the completion of the construction. Accordingly, we now own 60% of the Jewelry Park. Upon our payment of the final installment payment in April or May 2016, we will become the 100% owner of Wuhan Huayuan, which owns the land use rights of the Jewelry Park. However, because no other assets or liabilities have been transferred with the acquisition of Wuhan Huayuan, we are treating the Jewelry Park acquisition as an asset purchase for accounting purposes. In October 2015, Wuhan Kingold signed a supplemental agreement with the construction company Wuhan Wansheng to amend the original acquisition agreement dated October 23, 2013. Pursuant to this supplemental agreement, Wuhan Wansheng agreed to fully complete the construction and deliver the completed real estate property to the company before January 15, 2016. However, due to the cold weather condition and construction worker leave during the holiday season, the construction work on the Jewelry Park has been further delayed. In January 2016, based on the actual construction progress, both parties reached to a further amendment to extend the construction completion time to April 2016. Wuhan Kingold agreed to pay the balance of construction payments within ten days after Wuhan Wansheng fully completes the construction and delivers the completed real estate property to the Company with anticipate of occupancy. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was still committed to pay the remaining amount of approximately $75 million (approximately RMB 480 million) to the construction company. From late January to early March 2016, the Company subsequently paid RMB 79 million (approximately $12.2 million) to the construction company to settle the outstanding construction payable and plans to pay the remaining amount when the construction work is fully completed in late April 2016. For a discussion of the installment payment schedule, see Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, as well as &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are located in Wuhan, which is one of the largest cities in China. We expect to grow in fiscal year 2016 because management plans to increase customized production as our customers tend to give more gold to us to process when their investment confidence increased as market gold price bounced back since late 2015.

&#160;

Industry and Market Overview 

&#160; 

The Global Market 

&#160;

Global consumer demand for gold in 2015 was 4,212.2 tons with total market size of US $157.1 billion, according to the World Gold Council&#8217;s Gold Demand Trends Full Year 2015. In terms of tonnage, jewelry accounted for 57.3% of total demand in 2015, while investments (mainly bars and coins) accounted for 24.0%.

&#160;

According to the World Gold Council, China and India continue to consume the most jewelry of any market in the world, and in 2015 together generated 62.0% of total annual jewelry demand globally. China consumed a total of 841.9 tons of gold in 2015, while India consumed 654.3 tons.

&#160;

The PRC Market 

&#160;

China&#8217;s market for jewelry and other luxury goods is expanding rapidly over the decade, in large part due to China&#8217;s rapid economic growth.. According to the State Bureau of Statistics of China, China&#8217;s real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew by approximately 6.9% and 7.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Economic growth in China has led to greater levels of personal disposable income and increased spending among China&#8217;s expanding consumer base. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, private consumption has grown at a 9.0% compound annual growth rate over the last decade.

&#160;

According to the World Gold Council, over the last ten years, Chinese gold consumers have displayed a remarkably consistent attitude towards gold. Chinese demand is primarily driven by: (i) the continued urbanization of the Chinese population; (ii) the dominance of 24-karat gold and its role as a savings proxy; and (iii) increasing availability of gold investment products to a populace with a growing awareness of gold&#8217;s investment properties, particularly in light of its role as an inflation hedge.

&#160;

In volume terms, Chinese consumer demand for gold increased in 2015. Chinese total consumer demand for gold reached 813.6 tons in 2014 and 1,050.8 tons in 2015 representing a growth rate of 29.1%. Investment gold (bars and coins) demand has slowly recovered from 2014, particularly in China, from 190.1 tons in 2014 to 208.9 tons in 2015.

&#160;

We believe that China&#8217;s gold jewelry market will continue to grow as China&#8217;s economy continues to develop. Since gold has long been a symbol of wealth and prosperity in China, demand for gold jewelry, particularly 24-karat gold jewelry, is firmly embedded in the country&#8217;s culture. Gold has long been viewed as both a secure and accessible savings vehicle, and as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture. In addition, gold jewelry plays an important role in marriage ceremonies, child birth, and other major life events in China. Gold ornaments, often in the shapes of dragons, horses and other cultural icons, have long been a customary gift for newly married couples and newborn children in China. As China&#8217;s population becomes more urban, more westernized, and more affluent, gold, platinum and other precious metal jewelry are becoming increasingly popular and affordable fashion accessories. The gold jewelry market is currently benefiting from rising consumer spending and rapid urbanization of the Chinese population. We believe that jewelry companies like us, with a developed distribution network, attractive designs, and reliable product quality, are well-positioned to build up our brands and capture an increasing share of China&#8217;s growing gold jewelry market.

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160;

We believe the following strengths contribute to our competitive advantages and differentiate us from our competitors:

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We have a proven manufacturing capability. 

&#160; 

We have developed seven proprietary processes that we believe are well integrated and are crucial to gold jewelry manufacturing, namely the processes for 99.9% gold hardening, rubber mold opening efficiency, solder-less welding, pattern carving, chain weaving, dewaxing casting, and our coloring methods.

&#160;

We have a proven design capability. 

&#160; 

We have a large and experienced in-house design team with a track record of developing products that are fashionable and well received in the jewelry market. We have built up an exclusive partnership with the leading jewelry school in China, the Jewelry Institute of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), to help us design and launch new products. We are committed to further strengthening our design team and continuing to improve the quality and novelty of our products so as to capture increased market share in the high-end gold jewelry market.

&#160;

We believe that we have superior brand awareness in China. 

&#160; 

We have established the Kingold brand through our focused sales and marketing efforts, and we believe that it is well known in China. We continue to devote significant efforts towards brand development and marketing in an attempt to enhance the market recognition of our products, such as our Mgold jewelry line of products. Our brand awareness was demonstrated in part by &#8220;Kingold&#8221; being named a &#8220;Famous Brand in Hubei Province,&#8221; &#8220;Famous Brand in China,&#8221; and &#8220;Famous Jewelry Brand&#8221; by the General Administration of Quality Supervision and China Top Brand Strategy Promotion Committee in 2007. We believe these awards have added credibility to and strengthened customers&#8217; confidence in our products. We have also participated in various exhibitions and trade fairs to promote our products and brands.

&#160; 

We have a well-established distribution network throughout China. 

&#160; 

We have been actively operating in this industry for more than ten years since the gold jewelry industry became open to the private sector in 2002. In the jewelry industry, a well-established and well-maintained distribution network is critical to success. We have established stable and mutually beneficial business relationships with a range of business partners, including large distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. These relationships are essential to our company, and provide us with a key competitive advantage. We have distributors in most provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in PRC.

&#160;

We believe that we have significant advantages in the areas of capacity, technology and talent when compared to our competitors. 

&#160; 

We have expanded our capacity significantly in recent years. In 2014, we processed 24-karat gold jewelry and Chinese ornaments with a total weight of approximately 60.1 tons, substantially exceeding prior year production of approximately 51.1 tons in 2013. In fiscal 2015, our actual production was 56.5 tons, slightly decreased as compared to the production in 2014. We attach great importance to the continuous improvement of our technology. Our gold processing systems dramatically reduce waste during the manufacturing process to approximately just one gram per kilogram of gold.

&#160; 

We have been awarded 26 patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, 2 of which will expire in 2017, 21 of which will expire in 2019, and 3 of which will expire in 2029. We have made significant investments in training and retaining our own in-house design and manufacturing team. We have an exclusive agreement with the China University of Geosciences School of Jewelry in Wuhan, or the School of Jewelry in Wuhan, which provides us with new, unique and innovative designs through students majoring in jewelry design and jewelry processing technology. These designs are proprietary to us, so our competitors do not have access to these designs. We also provide internships to talented students at the School of Jewelry, which provides us with access to the designs that we believe are best suited for strong consumer sales.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are a member of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which has very limited membership and which affords the right to purchase gold directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange. 

&#160; 

We have been a member of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, or the Exchange, since 2003. Although the Chinese government eliminated the absolute restriction on trading gold in general, the right to purchase gold directly from the Exchange is limited. The Exchange possesses a membership system and only members can buy gold through its trading system. As of March 21, 2016, there were approximately 211 members of the Exchange throughout China. Non-members who want to purchase gold must deal with members of the Exchange at a higher purchase price compared to the price afforded to members of the Exchange.

&#160; 

We have an experienced management team in the Chinese gold industry. 

&#160; 

We have a strong and stable management team with valuable experience in the PRC jewelry industry. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Zhihong Jia, has been working in this industry for close to 20 years. Our general manager, Mr. Jun Wang, also has worked in the industry for more than a decade. Other members of our senior management team all have significant experience in key aspects of our operations, including product design, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to be the leading designer and manufacturer of 24-karat gold jewelry products and to become a sizable supplier of investment gold products in China. We intend to achieve our goal by implementing the following strategies:

&#160;

We intend to increase production capacity and marketing abilities through both existing channels and the planned Jewelry Park. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue to expand the production capacity with our self-generated cash flow as well as bank loans.

&#160;

We also intend to consider sub-contracting opportunities in order to further expand capacity. Given the fragmentation of the PRC gold jewelry and design industry, we believe there may be attractive consolidation opportunities for us to acquire other jewelers, which would allow us to further increase our market share and achieve economies of scale.

&#160;

We also intend to increase our production capacity and marketing abilities through forming relationships with other jewelry manufacturers in China, to whom we plan to lease space in our planned Jewelry Park.

&#160;

We plan to continue to specialize in the manufacture of 24-karat gold jewelry. 

&#160; 

We intend to leverage our experience in jewelry design to introduce new fashionable products with strong market recognition, such as our Mgold jewelry line of products, to target niche markets such as the fast growing wedding market. We plan to design new product lines of 24-karat gold jewelry to address the specific needs of our target customers. By staying on top of market trends, and expanding our design team and capabilities, we plan to continue to increase our revenues and market share.

&#160;

We intend to further promote and improve the use of our brand recognition. 

&#160; 

We intend to make continuous efforts in growing the brand recognition of our Kingold brand and increasing our market share. Through marketing and the promotion of our high-end product lines such as Mgold, we believe the credentials and reputation of our brand will be further enhanced.

&#160;

We will increase the automation in our production line. 

&#160; 

Our production lines use modern technologies and production techniques that we continuously strive to improve. We plan to increase the level of automation in our production lines, which will lower our average costs and expand our production capacity. With our entrance into the investment gold market, we intend to rely more on automated production processes.

&#160;

We intend to enlarge our PRC customer base. 

&#160; 

We intend to strive to expand our PRC customer base by strengthening current relationships with distributors, retailers and other wholesalers in our existing markets. We also plan to expand upon our customer base by developing new relationships with strategic distributors and retailers in markets we have not yet penetrated and adding customers in the PRC.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

Products 

&#160; 

We currently offer a wide range of 24-karat gold products, including 99.9% and 99% pure gold necklaces, rings, earrings, bracelets, pendants and gold bars.

&#160;

Design and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We have adopted a systematic approach to product design and manufacturing that we believe is rigorous. We employ a senior design team with members educated by top art schools or colleges in China, including an exclusive agreement with the School of Jewelry in Wuhan, who have an average of three to five years of experience. In May 2015, we also formed a new subsidiary Wuhan Yuhuang Jewelry Design Co., Ltd. in order to better design the jewelry products to meet customers&#8217; demand and expectation. Our design team develops and generates new ideas from a variety of sources, including direct customer feedback, trade shows, and industry conferences. We generally test the market potential and customer appeal of our new products and services through a wide outreach program in specific regions prior to a full commercial launch. We have a large-scale production base that includes a 74,933 square foot factory, a dedicated design, sales and marketing team, and more than 400 company-trained employees. Our production lines include automated jewelry processing equipment and procedures that we can rapidly modify to accommodate new designs and styles.

&#160;

We are currently working with Wuhan Wansheng to build the Jewelry Park, with total floor space expected to be approximately 193,000 square meters (approximately 2,068,275 square feet). We expect that the Jewelry Park will become the new jewelry hub for Wuhan and central China in general. Upon its completion, we plan to transfer our headquarters to the Jewelry Park and to make it a state-of-art design center and additional location for manufacturing facilities.

&#160; 

Supply of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We purchase gold, our major raw material, directly from the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Our membership grants us the right to purchase gold from the Exchange, a right that is not available to non-members. Beginning in 2013, we also started to lease gold from certain leading Chinese commercial banks to provide an additional supply of raw materials under certain gold lease arrangements which we renewed in 2014 and 2015, and we may renew in 2016.

&#160; 

Security Measures 

&#160; 

We believe that we implement the best of breed security measures to protect our assets, including our 24-karat gold, and we believe these measures are well beyond those of our competitors. Our comprehensive security measures at our Wuhan facility include (i) a 24-hour onsite police station with direct deployment of police officers and instant access to the Wuhan city police department and (ii) security guards at each point of entry. Security guards roam our facilities, and monitor security cameras (with video surveillance by both random and fixed cameras) and alarm systems in our warehouse. Our gold is stored in a state of the art vault with encryption and authentication technology, which requires several designated management employees to open the vault, all of whom have different access codes known only to a limited number of officers. Therefore, no one individual can open our vault without the access codes of the others. In addition, every employee or visitor is required to pass through a security check (to include a metal detector) when he or she enters and leaves the jewelry production area. We review our security measures on an annual basis and regularly look to upgrade our systems after such review.

&#160;

Quality Control 

&#160; 

We consider quality control an important factor for the success of our business. We have a strict quality control system that is implemented by a well-trained team to ensure effective quality control over every step of our business operations, from design and manufacturing to marketing and sales. We have received ISO 9001 accreditation from the International Organization for Standardization attesting to our quality control systems. In 2004, we were named an &#8220;Honest and Trustworthy Enterprise&#8221; by the Hubei Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Currently we have approximately 300 major customers covering 25 provinces in China. We have very stable relationships with our major customers who have generally increased order volume year by year. In 2013, we renovated our showroom in Wuhan where we are based. In 2015, we launched an online business. These new sales channels are still in the development stage and have not yet generated meaningful business for 2015.

&#160;

We plan to build up the Jewelry Park to allow us to work closely with other leading jewelers and jewelry manufacturers in China, thereby creating opportunities for us to cross-sell and up-sell. We expect that our Jewelry Park will become a driving force for our sales and marketing efforts in China.

&#160;

Major Customers 

&#160; 

During the years ended December 31, 2014, approximately 27.4% of our net sales were generated from our five largest customers. King Mei Fook Jewelry became our largest customer in 2014 (5.8% of our total net sales in 2014). During the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 18.8% of our net sales generated from our five largest customers. Shenzhen Yuehao Jewelry Co., Ltd was our largest customer in 2015 (4.3% of our total net sales in 2015). None of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in either 2014 or 2015.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The jewelry industry in China is highly fragmented and very competitive. No single competitor has a significant percentage of the overall market. We believe that the market may become even more competitive as the industry grows and/or consolidates.

&#160;

We produce high-quality jewelry for which the demand has grown year by year as income levels in China have risen and customers continue to appreciate the high quality of our products. We believe the Kingold brand is well-recognized within the industry across China, which has substantially differentiated us from most of our competitors.

&#160;

We compete with local jewelry manufacturers and large foreign multinational companies that offer products similar to ours. Examples of our competitors include, but are not limited to, Zhejiang Sun &#38; Moon Jewelry Group Co., Ltd. (listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange), Shenzhen Bo Fook Jewelry Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Ganlu Jewelry Co., Ltd., Magfrey Jewelry Co., Ltd., and Guangdong Chaohongji Co., Ltd.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights and to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the jewelry industry.

&#160;

We currently have 26 patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC, 2 of which expire in 2017, 21 in 2019 and 3 in 2029.

&#160;

We have 17 registered trademarks in China, 3 of which expire in 2017, 1 in 2019, 6 in 2020 and 7 in 2021. In particular, &#8220;Kingold&#8221; has been named as a &#8220;Famous Brand in Hubei Province, &#8221; &#8220;Famous Brand in China,&#8221; and &#8220;Famous Jewelry Brand&#8221; by the General Administration of Quality Supervision and China Top Brand Strategy Promotion Committee.

&#160;

We have implemented and enhanced intellectual property management procedures in an effort to protect our intellectual property rights. However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of China may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws in other jurisdictions.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

PRC Government Regulations 

&#160; 

We are subject to various PRC laws and regulations that are relevant to our business. Our business license permits us to design, manufacture, sell and market jewelry products to department stores throughout China, and allows us to engage in the retail distribution of our products. Any further amendment to the scope of our business will require additional government approvals. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary government approval for any change or expansion of our business.

&#160;

Under applicable PRC laws, the supply of precious metals such as platinum, gold and silver is highly regulated by certain government agencies, such as the People&#8217;s Bank of China, or the PBOC. The Shanghai Gold Exchange is the only PBOC authorized supplier of precious metal materials and is our primary source of supply for our raw materials, which substantially consist of precious metals. We are required to obtain and hold several memberships and approval certificates from these government agencies in order to continue to conduct our business. We may be required to renew such memberships and to obtain approval certificates periodically. If we are unable to renew these periodic memberships or approval certificates, it would materially affect our business operations. We are currently in good standing with these agencies.

&#160;

We have also been granted independent import and export rights. These rights permit us to import and export jewelry into and out of China. With the relatively lower cost of production in China, we intend to expand into overseas markets after the launch of our China-based retail plan. We do not currently have plans to import jewelry into China.

&#160;

Environmental Protection 

&#160; 

Our production facilities in Wuhan are subject to environmental regulation by both the central government of the PRC and by local government agencies. We have obtained all necessary operating permits as required from the Environmental Protection Bureau, and believe that we are in compliance with local regulations governing waste production and disposal, and that our production facilities have met the public safety requirements regarding refuse, emissions, lights, noise and radiation. Since commencement of our operations, we have not been cited for any environmental violations. Because our production process creates almost no waste water or pollution, our costs for environmental compliance have been minimal and immaterial.

&#160;

Tax 

&#160; 

Wuhan Kingold was incorporated in the PRC and is subject to PRC income tax, which is computed according to the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC. The applicable income tax rate is 25.0%.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value-Added Tax, or VAT, and its implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of repairs and replacement services and the importation of goods in China are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 17.0% of the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer.

&#160;

Foreign Currency Exchange 

&#160; 

Under applicable PRC foreign currency exchange regulations, the Renminbi is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce, the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission.

&#160;

Dividend Distributions 

&#160; 

Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10.0% of its after-tax profits each year to its general reserves until the cumulative amount of such reserves has reached 50.0% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 568 full-time employees, all of whom were located in PRC except for our Chief Financial Officer. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. Our full-time employees are entitled to employee benefits including medical care, work related injury insurance, maternity insurance, unemployment insurance and pension benefits through a Chinese government mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan. We are required to accrue those benefits based on certain percentages of the employees&#8217; salaries and make contributions to the plans out of the amounts accrued for medical and pension benefits. The Chinese government is responsible for the medical benefits and the pension liability paid to these employees.

&#160;

Effective from January 1, 2008, the PRC has introduced a labor contract law that enhances rights for the nation&#8217;s workers, including open-ended work contracts and severance payments, and requires employers to enter into labor contracts with their workers in writing, restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with a fixed-term contract be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after the fixed-term contract has been renewed twice. Although the labor contract law could increase our labor costs, we do not anticipate there will be any significant effects on our overall profitability in the near future because such amount was historically not material to our operating cost. Management anticipates this may be a step toward improving candidate retention for skilled workers.

&#160;

Company History 

&#160; 

Since December 2009, we have been engaged in the design, manufacturing and sale of gold jewelry in the PRC via a VIE relationship with Wuhan Kingold, a PRC company.

&#160;

We were initially incorporated in 1995 in Delaware as Vanguard Enterprises, Inc. In 1999, we changed our corporate name to Activeworlds.com, Inc. (and subsequently to Activeworlds Corp.), and through a wholly-owned subsidiary we provided internet software products and services that enabled the delivery of three-dimensional content over the internet. We operated that business until September 11, 2002, when we sold that business to our former management and we became a shell company with no significant business operations. As a result of the consummation of a reverse acquisition transaction as described below, on December 23, 2009, we ceased to be a shell company and became an indirect holding company for Wuhan Vogue-Show Jewelry Co., Limited, or Vogue-Show, through Dragon Lead Group Limited, or Dragon Lead.

&#160;

Acquisition of Kingold and Name Change 

&#160; 

In December 2009, we acquired 100% of Dragon Lead from the shareholders of Dragon Lead in a share exchange transaction pursuant to which the shareholders of Dragon Lead exchanged 100% ownership in Dragon Lead for 33,104,234 shares of our common stock. As a result, Dragon Lead became our wholly owned subsidiary. Dragon Lead owns 100% of Vogue-Show and Vogue-Show controls Wuhan Kingold through a series of variable interest entity agreements. We currently operate through Dragon Lead and Vogue-Show.

&#160;

In February 2010, we changed our name to Kingold Jewelry, Inc. to better reflect our business.

&#160;

Organizational History of Dragon Lead and its Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Dragon Lead, a British Virgin Islands, or BVI corporation, was incorporated in the BVI on July 1, 2008 as an investment holding company. Dragon Lead owns 100% of the ownership interest in Vogue-Show.

The Vogue-Show/Wuhan Kingold VIE Relationship 

&#160; 

On June 30, 2009, Vogue-Show entered into a series of agreements with Wuhan Kingold and shareholders holding 95.83% of the outstanding equity of Wuhan Kingold under which Wuhan Kingold agreed to pay 95.83% of its after-tax profits to Vogue-Show and shareholders owning 95.83% of Wuhan Kingold&#8217;s shares have pledged their and delegated their voting power in Wuhan Kingold to Vogue-Show. Such share pledge is registered with the PRC Administration for Industry and Commerce. These agreements were subsequently amended on October 20, 2011, when the minority stockholder holding 4.17% of the equity of Wuhan Kingold became a party to the applicable VIE agreements. Following execution of the amendments, shareholders holding 100% of the outstanding equity of Wuhan Kingold were parties to the agreements such that Wuhan Kingold has agreed to pay 100% of its after-tax profits to Vogue-Show and shareholders owning 100% of Wuhan Kingold&#8217;s shares have pledged and delegated their voting power in Wuhan Kingold to Vogue- Show.

&#160;

The VIE agreements, which are described below, currently cover 100% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold, and were initially created so that upon the closing of the reverse acquisition, as described below, we would be able to acquire control of Wuhan Kingold, as explained below.

&#160;

These contractual arrangements enable us to:

&#160;

&#8226; exercise effective control over our variable interest entity, Wuhan Kingold;

&#160;

&#8226; receive substantially all of the economic benefits from variable interest entity, Wuhan Kingold; and

&#160;

&#8226; have an exclusive option to purchase 100% of the equity interest in our variable interest entity, Wuhan Kingold, when and to the extent permitted by PRC law.

&#160;

Through such arrangement, Wuhan Kingold has become Vogue-Show&#8217;s contractually controlled affiliate. In addition, Wuhan Kingold shareholders agreed to grant Vogue-Show a ten-year option to purchase a 100% equity interest in Wuhan Kingold at a price based on an appraisal provided by an asset evaluation institution that will be jointly appointed by Vogue-Show and the Wuhan Kingold shareholders. Concurrently, Wuhan Kingold agreed to grant Vogue-Show a ten-year option to purchase all of Wuhan Kingold&#8217;s assets at a price based on an appraisal provided by an asset evaluation institution that will be jointly appointed by Vogue-Show and Wuhan Kingold.

&#160;

The VIE Agreements 

&#160; 

Our relationship with Wuhan Kingold and its shareholders is governed by a series of contractual arrangements, which agreements provide as follows:

&#160;

Exclusive Management Consulting and Technical Support Agreement. On June 30, 2009, Vogue-Show initially entered into an Exclusive Management Consulting and Technical Support Agreement with Wuhan Kingold, as subsequently amended, which provided that Vogue-Show will be the exclusive provider of management consulting services to Wuhan Kingold, and obligated Vogue-Show to provide services to fully manage and control all internal operations of Wuhan Kingold, in exchange for receiving 95.83% of Wuhan Kingold&#8217;s profits. On October 20, 2011, Wuhan Kingold and Vogue-Show amended this agreement such that Wuhan Kingold is now obligated to pay 100% of its after-tax profits to Vogue-Show. Payments will be made on a monthly basis. The term of this agreement will continue until it is either terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or until such time as Vogue-Show shall acquire 100% of the equity or assets of Wuhan Kingold.

&#160;

Shareholders' Voting Proxy Agreement. On June 30, 2009, shareholders holding 95.83% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold entered into a Shareholders&#8217; Voting Proxy Agreement authorizing Vogue-Show to exercise any and all shareholder rights associated with their ownership in Wuhan Kingold, including the right to attend and vote their shares at shareholders&#8217; meetings, the right to call shareholders&#8217; meetings and the right to exercise all other shareholder voting rights as stipulated in the Articles of Association of Wuhan Kingold. Following the October 20, 2011 amendment to this agreement, shareholders holding 100% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold have now entered into the Shareholders&#8217; Voting Proxy Agreement. The term of this agreement will continue until it is either terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or until such time as Vogue-Show shall acquire 100% of the equity or assets of Wuhan Kingold.

&#160;

Purchase Option Agreement. On June 30, 2009, shareholders holding 95.83% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold entered into a Purchase Option Agreement with Vogue-Show, which provided that Vogue-Show will be entitled to acquire such Shareholders&#8217; shares in Wuhan Kingold upon certain terms and conditions, if such a purchase is or becomes allowable under PRC laws and regulations. The Purchase Option Agreement also grants to Vogue-Show an option to purchase all of the assets of Wuhan Kingold. Following the October 20, 2011 amendment to this agreement, shareholders holding 100% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold have now entered into the Purchase Option Agreement. The exercise price for either the shares or the assets is to be as determined by a qualified third party appraiser. The term of this agreement is ten years from the date thereof.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Pledge of Equity Agreement. On June 30, 2009, shareholders holding 95.83% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold entered into a Pledge of Equity Agreement, pursuant to which each such shareholder pledges all of his shares of Wuhan Kingold to Vogue-Show in order to guarantee performance under the Exclusive Management Consulting and Technical Support Agreement, Shareholders&#8217; Voting Proxy Agreement and the Purchase Option Agreement. Following the October 20, 2011 amendment to this agreement, shareholders holding 100% of the equity interest in Wuhan Kingold have now entered into the Pledge of Equity Agreement. If Wuhan Kingold or any of its respective shareholders breaches its respective contractual obligations, Vogue-Show, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including the right to foreclose on the pledged equity interests.

&#160;

Reverse Acquisition and Private Placement 

&#160; 

On September 29, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reverse Acquisition with Vogue-Show, Dragon Lead, and the stockholders of Dragon Lead, or the Dragon Lead Stockholders. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Dragon Lead in exchange for the issuance of 33,104,234 newly issued shares of our common stock. The acquisition agreement closed on or about December 23, 2009. Following the closing, Dragon Lead became our wholly-owned subsidiary.

&#160;

The purpose of the reverse acquisition was to acquire control over Wuhan Kingold. We did not acquire Wuhan Kingold directly through the issuance of stock to Wuhan Kingold&#8217;s stockholders because under PRC law it is uncertain whether a share exchange would be legal. We instead chose to acquire control of Wuhan Kingold through the acquisition of Vogue-Show and the VIE arrangements previously described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain rules and regulations in the PRC restrict the ability of non-PRC companies that are controlled by PRC residents to acquire PRC companies. There is significant uncertainty as to whether these rules and regulations require transactions of the type contemplated by our VIE arrangements, or of the type contemplated by the Call Option described below, to be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce, the China Securities and Regulatory Commission, or other agencies.

&#160;

On December 23, 2009, immediately prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition, we completed a private placement with 14 investors. Pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with the investors, we sold an aggregate of 5,120,483 newly issued shares of our common stock at $0.996 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $5.1 million. The investors in the private placement also received five-year warrants to purchase up to 1,024,096 shares of common stock at the price of $0.996 per share. After commissions and expenses, we received net proceeds of approximately $4.55 million in the private placement. In addition, five-year warrants to purchase up to 1,536,145 shares of common stock at the price of $0.996 per share were issued to various consultants who assisted in the transaction.

&#160;

All share and per share information for dates prior to August 10, 2010 concerning our common stock in the above discussion reflects a 1-for-2 reverse stock split.

&#160;

As a result of the above transactions, we ceased being a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act.

&#160;

Also, on December 17, 2014, Fok Wing Lam Winnie (whose Mandarin name is Huo Yong Lin), the sole shareholder of Famous Grow and the majority shareholder of Dragon Lead prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition, entered into an Amended and Restated Call Option Agreement, as amended and restated, or call option, with Zhihong Jia and Bin Zhao to comply with PRC regulations that restrict PRC residents from owning offshore entities like us in direct exchange for their shares in the PRC operating company and as an inducement to encourage them to provide services to Wuhan Kingold and our company. The call option does not include a vesting schedule and continued employment is not a condition to the call option. The Amended and Restated Call Option Agreement was further amended on March 26, 2016. Under the call option, as amended and restated, Fok Wing Lam Winnie granted to Zhihong Jia the right to acquire up to 100% of the shares of Famous Grow at an exercise price of $1.00, which is par value per share, or $0.001 per Famous Grow share, subject to any exercise notice at any time for a period of ten years, which was determined in an arm's length negotiation with the parties. While it is the case that our PRC counsel believes that this arrangement is lawful under PRC laws and regulations, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations, including regulations governing the validity and legality of such call options. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.

In April 2015, Wuhan Kingold Jewelry Co., Inc. (&#8220;Wuhan Kingold&#8221;) established a new subsidiary Wuhan Kingold Internet Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Kingold Internet&#8221;). Total registered capital of Kingold Internet is RMB 1 million (approximately $0.15 million), of which Wuhan Kingold holds a 55% ownership interest and a third-party minority shareholder, Mr. Xiaofeng Lv, holds the remaining 45% ownership interest. Kingold Internet engages in promoting the online sales of jewelry products through cooperation with Tmall.com, a large business-to-consumer online retail platform owned by Alibaba Group.

&#160;

In May 2015, Kingold Internet established a 100% controlled subsidiary Yuhuang Jewelry Design Co., Ltd (&#8220;Yuhuang&#8221;). Total registered capital of Yuhuang is RMB 1 million (approximately $0.15 million). Since Wuhan Kingold holds a 55% ownership interest of Kingold Internet, Wuhan Kingold also indirectly controls 55% ownership interest in Yuhuang and minority shareholder Mr. Xiaofeng Lv holds the remaining 45% ownership interest in Yuhuang. Yuhuang engages in the jewelry design business.
