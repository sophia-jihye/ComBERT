BUSINESS 

Overview 

TOMI Environmental Solutions,Inc. is a leading provider of infection prevention and decontamination products and services, focused primarily on life sciences including healthcare, bio-safety, pharmaceutical, clean-room and research. Our mission is to help our customers create a healthier world thru TOMI&#8217;s product line. TOMI&#8217;s motto is &#8220;innovating for a safer world&#8221; for healthcare and life. 

As a global decontamination and infectious disease control company, TOMI provides environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface decontamination through the sale of equipment, services and licensing of our SteraMist TM Binary Ionization Technology&#174; (&#8220;BIT&#8482;&#8221;) which is a EPA registered hydrogen peroxide based mist and fog. 

During August 2010, TOMI entered into negotiations to purchase the assets of a U.S. Defense company&#8217;s division that owned and operated BIT Technology. BIT Technology was a division of L-3 Applied Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;L-3&#8221;). In April 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from L-3 for $3,510,000 and TOMI began to develop, engineer and complete regulatory testing for the EPA registrations of BIT technology and solution as a Hospital-Healthcare Disinfectant. BIT technology is the platform that runs our SteraMist TM equipment that currently accounts for nearly all of our revenue. 

TOMI reengineered the prototypes into TOMI&#8217;s current model of Binary Ionization Technology&#174; (BIT&#8482;), branded as SteraMist&#8482;. This technology was developed for the neutralization of anthrax spores and sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (&#8220;DARPA&#8221;). This novel D efense A dvanced R esearch P rojects A gency project &#160; was sanctioned under DARPA/CMO Contract No. MDA972-03-C-0092 and developed thru the Special Projects Office/SPO &#8232; Program: Immune Building &#8232; DARPA Order No. P896/00 Program Code: 3310 3701 North Fairfax Drive &#8232; Arlington, VA 22203-1714 

In June 2015, SteraMist&#8482; BIT&#8482; was granted a registration from the US Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent (EPA Registration 90150-2). Our product also holds a second EPA registration for mold control and air &#38; surface remediation (EPA Registration 90150-1). 

Our Technology 

BIT was developed in response to Amerithrax, the anthrax attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11,2001 US terrorist attacks. It is a patented two-step process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution producing a fine aqueous mist that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (&#8220;ROS&#8221;), mostly hydroxyl radicals. ROS cause damage to pathogenic organisms via mechanisms such as oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids leading to cellular disruption and/or dysfunction. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution, occurs after passing our EPA registered solution thru our high energy atmospheric cold plasma arc, causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, net result is the hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (&#8220;AIHP&#8221;). This TOMI patented process allows these ROS&#8217;s (hydroxyl radicals) to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity. 

Testing detailed by DARPA demonstrates these ROS, which include the hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radicals, aggressively break the double bonds in bacterial spores, biological and chemical warfare agents (BWA and CWA) neutralizing their threat and producing nontoxic byproducts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Brought to the commercial market by TOMI in June 2013, TOMI&#8217;s current suite of products incorporates TOMI&#8217;s BIT&#8482; Solution, special applicators which creates the SteraMist&#8482; Surface Unit and the SteraMist&#8482; Environment System. Current SteraMist&#8482; BIT&#8482; Technology has expanded beyond the initial chemical and biological warfare applications to deactivate problem microorganisms (including spores) in healthcare, laboratory, clean rooms and a wide variety of other commercial and residential settings. SteraMist&#8482; BIT&#8482; provides fast acting biological deactivation and works in even the most hard-to-reach areas while leaving no residue or noxious fumes. The by-products produced by SteraMist are just oxygen and water in the form of humidity. 

TOMI&#8217;s SteraMist&#8482; Surface Unit is a fully portable fast-acting, hand held, point and spray disinfection/decontamination system. It is a safe and easy process to make certain that your facility, home or assets are disinfected/decontaminated to the maximum extent possible. The single applicator surface unit enables disinfection of all surfaces&#8211;including high touch, sensitive medical equipment and electronics. The space is safe to re-enter within minutes after the Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (AIHP) mist has been applied. With a registered EPA 5-second application time, 7-minute contact time seamlessly results into a quick room turnover and controls and eliminates MRSA and H1N1. 

TOMI&#8217;s SteraMist&#8482; unit is lightweight, easy to transport, and capable of achieving reliable disinfection/decontamination results as it is easily incorporated into current cleaning procedures and protocols. The hydroxyl radicals produced by TOMI&#8217;s plasma science does not require heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems to be shut down and requires no wiping, leaves no residue and is a bleach, chlorine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, titanium dioxide, peracetic and silver ion free formula. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

TOMI&#8217;s SteraMist&#8482; Environment System is a transportable remotely controlled system that provides complete room disinfection/decontamination of a sealed space, up to 103.8 m3 (3,663 ft3). Individually, each remote applicator can be used to treat a space of approximately 34.6 m3 (1,221 ft3). Multiple SteraMistTM Environment Systems can be used simultaneously to accommodate larger spaces with fast application and minimal down time. Mechanical cleaning makes whole room disinfecting/decontaminating easier. With TOMI&#8217;s touchless application solution you can treat multiple areas simultaneously. Our hybrid technology - applicators can be used in manual and/or fogging modes. Great for frequent daily use, this system saves time and labor. SteraMist&#8482; is a powerful technology in fighting, reducing and eliminating bacteria including C. diff spores. When you reenter the room you can &#8220;smell the clean&#8221;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

TOMI currently targets domestic and international markets. TOMI&#8217;s approach to the international markets is either thru strategic partners, manufacturer representatives or licensed distribution partners. The company is currently focused in Mexico and Central America, the EU and Asia. Domestically, TOMI&#8217;s primary market consists of Healthcare-Hospitals, Bio-safety and Pharmaceutical along with many other verticals that are covered thru its professional service division. Internationally, TOMI technologies are used for the control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and small indoor space for biological pathogens and chemical agents. These include infectious diseases in hospitals, bio-secure labs and pharmaceutical manufactures, biodefense and biosafety facilities, including isolation and transfer chambers, tissue banks, food safety and many other commercial and residential settings. 

Internationally, SteraMist&#8482; has been used and has shown to reduce many problem organisms found in healthcare and other environments including bacterial spores, VRE, C. diff, MERS and Ebola. TOMI has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO&#8217;s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at the largest hospital in Panama, participated in the control of MERS in South Korea and has successfully passed a test during the MERS outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. TOMI also decommissioned the Ebola treatment center in West Africa. In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist is being used in terminal cleans, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of C. diff spore rates in those hospitals. 

Independent lab testing, study data from international pharmaceutical companies and field clinical data have shown six-log efficacy which is a 99.9999% kill in both C. diff spores and against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is a laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21856988. 

In June 2015, SteraMist&#8482; BIT&#8482; was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. The EPA registered solution and equipment combination provides the unique technology of converting a low percentage hydrogen peroxide into an activated ionized hydrogen peroxide consisting mostly of hydroxyl radicals for Hospital-Healthcare disinfecting (EPA Registration 90150-2) . SteraMist&#8482; BIT&#8482; also holds a second EPA registration for mold control and air &#38; surface remediation (EPA Registration 90150-1). 

SteraMist is easily incorporated into current cleaning procedures, and is economical, non corrosive and easy to apply. Our technology goes above, beyond, under and around disinfecting sprays and wipes, leaves no residues and requires no wiping. (EPA Registration 90150-2) 

All of our SteraMist products are fully validated to comply with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) Standards, our solution is manufactured at a EPA registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) efficacy data for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mold, MRSA, H1N1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus (the gold standard for sterilization) and Clostridium difficile spores (C. diff spores). 

Effective as of July 10, 2015, TOMI entered into a Materials Transfer Agreement with the US Agriculture Research Service (ARS) to conduct food safety research using AIHP or SteraMist BIT. The Company is registered and has listed SteraMist as a disinfectant, medical device with the US Food &#38; Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) for FY 2016 pursuant to Title 21,807 et seq. of the Unites States Code of Federal Regulation. Establishment registration 3012117386, product code LRJ, Regulation Number 880.6890 and is seeking registration with the US Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) approval for its products to be utilized in the medical device sterilization field, food packaging, preservation and food safety industries. 

&#160;

This acquired patented technology relates to a disinfection/decontamination system that applies atmospheric cold plasma activation to a hydrogen peroxide based mist and fog. It then produces an ROS aerosolized mist that resembles a fog but moves like a gas. Trademarked as Binary Ionization Technology&#174; (BIT TM ), the technology deactivates most organic compounds quickly and effectively by inactivating viruses, killing bacteria, bacteria spores, molds spores, other fungi and yeast, both in the air and on surfaces. The EPA has registered TOMI&#8217;s products as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant, its surface unit for killing MRSA and inactivating H1N1 and its multifunctional environment unit for killing C. diff spores. BIT&#8482; does not damage delicate medical equipment and computers as BIT&#8482;&#8217;s only by-product is oxygen and water (humidity) BIT&#8482; carries a very small carbon footprint. 

SteraMist TM (BIT TM ) converts low percentage levels of hydrogen peroxide into a group of ROS composed mostly of hydroxyl radicals that provides fast acting, broad-spectrum decontamination, leaving no residue or noxious fumes. We believe the characteristics of the produced aerosol mist ensure safety of employees and equipment, while providing maximum decontamination efficacy to both air and surfaces. BIT TM has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents including anthrax, chemical agents such as VX, and Mustard gas when applied using properly developed international protocols. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

By acquiring this patent and all of its regulatory registrations TOMI now controls this technology and has the ability to build its client base and expand into other market segments beyond its current customer base including bio-safety and pharmaceutical clean rooms, food safety, healthcare, service industries and thru its service division (TSN). TOMI has the assets and capacity to respond to most worldwide pandemic emergencies. 

In May 2015, the Company was awarded a grant by the United States Agency for International Development (&#8220;USAid&#8221;) in the amount of $559,000 for the development of SteraMist TM Mobile Decontamination Chambers to fight Ebola. The grant is based on milestones set forth on the agreement between the Company and USAid. To date, five of the six benchmarks were achieved and TOMI decontaminated and decommissioned the EBOLA treatment center in West Africa in connection with its USAid Grant. 

Manufacturing 

The Company outsources the manufacturing of the TOMI SteraMist&#8482; line of equipment. In October of 2014, the Company entered into a manufacturing and development agreement with RG Group for a term of two years. RG Group is an ISO9001 registered Company with facilities in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. 

Industries 

&#160;

We believe that our technology, services and products offer a significant opportunity to help reduce the surface and rooms involvement in the spread to patients and others of Community Associated (CA) and Healthcare Associated Infections (&#8220;HAI&#8221;). HAI&#8217;s are one of the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control has noted Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are a major, yet often preventable, threat to patient safety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is committed to helping all Americans receive the best and safest care. The National and State Healthcare-Associated Infections Progress Report (HAI Progress Report) expands upon and provides an update to previous reports detailing progress toward the ultimate goal of eliminating HAIs. The reports can serve as a reference for anyone looking for information about national and state HAI prevention progress. The HAI progress report is specifically designed to be accessible to many audiences. For detailed methods, references, and definitions please refer to the Technical Appendix and Glossary within that report. For complete data tables and frequently asked questions, please visit CDC&#8217;s HAI Progress Report website at http://www.cdc.gov/hai/progress-report . 

&#160;

In March of 2009 HAIs have a direct cost to the healthcare system of approximately $35-$45 billion dollars annually. http://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/hai/scottcostpaper.pdf . Statistically, it has been documented that approximately 10% of inpatients contract infections from hospitals resulting in more than 2,000,000 illnesses and over 100,000 deaths per annum or 1 in every 25 admissions www cdc.gov/ hai/progress-report . Further, it has been estimated that approximately 15% of all discharged hospital patients are readmitted with infections. Traditional cleaning has been known to leave 30%-60% of pathogens behind. Also a well known study from 55 New England hospitals stated that 25% of operating room surfaces are left unclean. With the rapid turnover that is needed in today&#8217;s hospital rooms, treatment rooms, hotel rooms and mass transportation combined with the ability of bacteria to mutate and form drug resistant bacteria: manual cleaning has proven to be not as effective as it use to be in the past. Even after using surface chlorine wipes many pathogens can colonize, all a human needs is one cell to infect them to cause severe illness and or death. Any remaining surface pathogens can increase the risk of that person acquiring an HAI or other infection. 

Whenever challenged, TOMI&#8217;s BIT TM has safely and effectively produced a 99.9999% (a six-log kill). In comparison to most of its competitors, management believes that SteraMist TM technology has a quicker and higher kill level in a shorter time, leaving no residue, our product is not effected by humidity, is not caustic, does not blister painted surfaces, contains no silver ions, requires no humidity alteration prior to or after use, has a shorter exposure time, and is quicker to exhaust due to the production of our reactive oxygen species (AIHP) verses nebulization of higher concentrates of hydrogen peroxide, such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) type products. AIHP is a small 2-4 micron particle which contains no bleach, and rooms require little or no preparation prior to treatment. When AIHP is finished killing, inactivating and neutralizing bacteria, bacteria spores, fungi, viruses and certain chemical agents it converts to oxygen and water. 

Our SteraMist TM and BIT TM Technology and TOMI&#8217;s related service platform are currently being used in a broad spectrum of industries including: 

&#9679; medical facilities 

&#9679; bio-safety labs 

&#9679; tissue labs 

&#9679; clean rooms 

&#9679; office buildings 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; hospitality 

&#9679; schools 

&#9679; pharmaceutical companies 

&#9679; remediation companies 

&#9679; military 

&#9679; transportation 

&#9679; airports 

&#9679; first responders 

&#9679; single-family homes and multi-unit residences 

We also believe, based on our marketing efforts to date, that other potential vertical industry applications for our technology, service and products include: 

&#9679; blood banks 

&#9679; food safety industry 

&#9679; athletic facilities (from professional to educational) 

&#9679; airlines 

&#9679; entertainment 

&#9679; homeland defense and border protection 

&#9679; control and containment of pandemic breakouts 

The Company intends to generate and support research on improving, extending and applying our patents. To date, we have received interest, both domestically and internationally, to form business alliances with major healthcare companies, biosafety labs, tissue and blood labs, pharmaceutical companies, the food safety industry, border protection including homeland defense companies, construction companies and remediation companies. 

Marketing and Distribution 

Through our sales and services, our business growth objective is to be a global leader in disinfection and decontamination including domestic and international infectious disease control. We hope to achieve this through our premier platform of hydrogen peroxide mists and fogs, as well as other infectious control products and technologies. We intend to continue to expand and support research on other decontamination and remediation solutions including hydroxyl radicals and other ROS and to form more business alliances. This may include selling licenses and or performing decontamination services within cleanrooms, bio-safety labs, tissue and blood labs, pharmaceutical labs, kidney dialysis centers, major remediation companies, construction companies and corporations specializing in disaster relief. Our current intended geographic targets are located in North America, South America, Central America, Europe, Africa and the Far East. 

The Company primarily offers its products and services in the following market segments: 

Hospitals . We are seeking to expand our penetration of this market segment as we believe we can offer a solution to a significant problem at many healthcare facilities: the spread of airborne contaminants. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#8217;s (also known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, hospitals that have high rates of of infections and HAIs now face significant penalties. We believe the enactment of the ACA demonstrates the need hospitals have to control decrease and eliminate infection rates and HAIs. Based on our calculations, we believe that our SteraMist &#8482; BIT &#8482; technology, reduces the surfaces contributing factor in the spread of infections and HAIs in patient rooms, infectious disease rooms and operatory suites, with a corresponding return on investment to the hospital of up to 20-1 in the first year. 

Bio-safety labs, tissue and blood labs, cleanrooms. These categories all have one common trait. They need to reduce the chance of transfer risks. As risk assessment is a process used to identify the hazardous characteristics of a known infectious or potentially infectious agent or material, the activities in these labs can result in a person&#8217;s exposure to an agent, with a high likelihood that such exposure could cause probable consequences of an infection. 

The use of SteraMist&#8482; as a routine decontamination product in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards may reduce all the negative effects of current decontamination products such as Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP), formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and titanium dioxide including cancer exposure, blistering of paints, corrosion of metals and lengthy exposure times. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

There are many requirements and new restrictions on the type of decontamination agents these labs may use to prevent these risks and handle mishaps. In light of these regulations, we believe TOMI&#8217;s rapid deployment of its effective aerosolized reactive oxygen species could become the solution to lower risks and perform decontamination clean-up in these labs. Our product works within minutes and leaves no noxious chemical smell behind. Its by-products are just oxygen and humidity. 

We also believe that our products and technology can aid in all biosafety levels and microbiological practices, on all safety equipment, transfer hoods, isolation chambers, animal cages, and other equipment along with adding to facility safeguards to help prevent the risks associated with handling infectious microorganisms. 

Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is the basic level of protection and is appropriate for agents that are not known to cause disease in normal, healthy humans. Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) is appropriate for handling moderate-risk agents that cause human disease of varying severity by ingestion or through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) is appropriate for agents with a known potential for aerosol transmission, for agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal infections and that are indigenous or exotic in origin. Exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols and for which no treatment is available are restricted to high containment laboratories that meet biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) standards. The laboratory worker&#8217;s complete isolation from aerosolized infectious materials is accomplished primarily by working in a so-called Class III biological safety cabinet (BSC), which is a sealed enclosure with a viewing window, or in a full-body, air-supplied positive-pressure personnel suit. The BSL-4 facility itself is generally a separate building or completely isolated zone with complex, specialized ventilation requirements and waste management systems to prevent release of viable agents to the environment. 

TOMI&#8217;s BIT&#8482; technology has recently been successfully tested in level 3 (BSL-3) and level 4 (BSL-4), including in their animal research cages. SteraMist not only decontaminates space in minutes but also decontaminates the animal cages in minutes which helps in the prevention of the spread of diseases that are typically found within these research animal cages. 

Food Safety Industry. We believe that SteraMist TM could become a strongly preferred product as it relates to decontamination in the food safety industry. Food related ingesting of hundreds of bacteria, viruses, and parasites can contaminate parts of the world food supply and cause illnesses. According to the US Centers for Disease Control (&#8220;CDC&#8221;), 80 million people per year in the United States contract, and 5,000 people die from, food poisoning or other food related illnesses. Current cleaning techniques involve time intensive processes, which can reduce food manufacturers&#8217; profit. TOMI&#8217;s AIHP (Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide) degrades into only harmless water and oxygen. Since this can be applied to all foods (pending FDA and USDA approval) and all food packing and storage equipment, we believe it would be safe for use on electronics and kitchenware along with high touch surfaces where most pathogens are found generally (such as phones, computers and kitchen appliances). We believe that SteraMist could be useful for decontamination at all phases of food production, from the farm, slaughter house, packaging and canning facilities, to the transportation of food and to the restaurants and grocery stores. 

The Remediation Industry . Generally, a professional certified remediation company waits until an emergency or disaster occurs before they can earn fees. TOMI has implemented and plans to expand its certification, license and equipment program throughout the United States which allows these disaster professionals to earn fees by performing surface remediation and infectious disease control in addition to their emergency response related work. Since there are over 20,000 certified professional remediators in the United States, this is a market we are aggressively targeting. TOMI&#8217;s service division (TSN) has been borne out of the demand for our product nationally. 

Biodefense Industry. Countries around the world, including the United States, need to protect their borders and cities against a potential terrorist attack. Our SteraMist TM line of products may give international governmental bodies an added tool in their arsenal to potentially mitigate a risk of a weaponized biological attack. In addition, SteraMist TM could specifically assist in mitigating the spread of emerging pandemic viruses including strains of Ebola, MERS, along with various worldwide viruses, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8. In addition, border patrol agents internationally could utilize our SteraMist TM line of products to assist in ceasing the spread of infectious disease upon detected infected persons trying to enter their respective borders by decontaminating the interview rooms, containment rooms and holding cells after a potential infected carrier&#8217;s condition either improves or the carrier dies. 

Hospitality . Our products can be used for air remediation and surface cleaning, including those hard to clean areas and objects like remote controls, chairs, nooks and crannies, telephones and toilet seats. This could be advantageous to allow potential hospitality clients (such as hotels and motels) to make their rooms and common areas smell better and be cleaner prior to the check-in of hotel guests using our EPA registered disinfectant.

International Sales 

The Company began sales to international clients during the third quarter of 2010. In September 2013, the Company entered into a Sales and Distribution Agreement with TOMI Panama, a non-affiliated company in Panama. As part of this agreement the Company successfully completed an official pilot study at the request of Panama Social Security Program (CSS), performing bio-mass reduction and remediation of biological bacterial colonies. As a result, the Panamanian Government accepted the Company&#8217;s technology as the only decontamination product of its kind that is authorized by the Panamanian Government to be purchased by their hospitals for the next two years. On September 30, 2013, TOMI was awarded a multi-year contract from Panama Social Security Program (&#8220;CSS Contract&#8221;) to initiate biomass reduction and decontamination services. During the fourth quarter of 2013, TOMI completed the biomass reduction and decontamination services at The Complejo Hospitalario Metropolitano in Panama City, Panama. Currently, we are actively engaged to expand this program and make SteraMist TM a standard for decontamination in over 41 Panamanian hospitals. 

During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company&#8217;s Panamanian distribution partner initiated biomass reduction and decontamination services at The Complejo Hospitalario Metropolitano in Panama City, Panama. The initial project in Panama provides for decontamination services for 64,583 sq./ft. of space for an approximate value to the Company of $420,000. The Company completed this project in October 2013. The maintenance of this hospital continues daily. 

On March 21, 2014, the Company entered into a distribution and licensing agreement with Plascencia Universal, S. de R.L. de C.V. (&#8220;Plascencia Universal&#8221;), a Mexican company that will act as the exclusive distributor of TOMI&#8217;s products and services in Mexico. The agreement provides for a $300,000 licensing fee that will be recognized based on the gross purchases made by Plascencia Universal from the Company. Joseph Plascencia, the principal of Plascencia Universal, is the broker for the Company&#8217;s insurance policies and was appointed a director of the Company in connection with this agreement. In April 2015, the Company modified its agreement with Plascencia Universal with respect to the license fee included in the original agreement. In December, 2015 Mr. Plascencia resigned from TOMI&#8217;s board. 

In 2014 and 2015, the Company expanded into the South Korean market and entered into an independent sales agreement with KMS I&#38;T Co., Ltd. and Fine C&#38;S Co., both of whom are representatives of the G -Well Group. The Company has been shipping orders into the South Korean market since the fourth quarter of 2014. 

In 2015, the Company further expanded its entrance into the Asian market with an additional order shipped into the Philippines to Espire Health and the commencement of shipments into Singapore through an exclusive agreement with RNF Luxuries and shipments into the Malaysian market through SG Environmental Solutions. 

In addition, during the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company continued the expansion of its global presence into Europe with the shipment of product into Italy, France and Spain. In addition, during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Azbil Telstar Technologies, S.L.U., a Spanish company that will act as a non-exclusive distributor of products on a worldwide basis and is currently under contractual review with AM Instruments of Italy. 

TOMI Service Network 

In February 2015, the Company announced the launch of the TOMI Service Network (&#8220;TSN&#8221;). The TSN will allow the Company to enhance its service division by creating a national service network composed of existing full service restoration industry specialists. Since the launch of the TSN, the Company has recruited and entered into licensing agreements with 25 geographically and strategically placed companies that will become network hubs to take advantage of the of the Company&#8217;s SteraMist TM platform of products and assist as service providers for the Company&#8217;s domestic and international client base and provide regional, national, and international large event mobilization response. The current TSN members signed through December 31, 2015 were granted protected territories, exclusive network pricing and job referrals as well as many other service related benefits. The TSN licensing agreements provides for a purchase of certain amounts of SteraMist TM equipment and minimum annual orders of solution based on the population of the territories granted for the licensing agreements. The licensing agreements also provide for required training and marketing fees billed to the TSN members based on services provided by the Company. The term of the licensing agreement is for two years ( http://www.tomiservicenetwork.com ). 

Competition 

&#160; 

The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is extremely competitive. The Company&#8217;s competitors for its BIT&#8482; Technology include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide based products, such as Steris Corporation, Bioquell, Inc. and Sanosil Ltd, various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. These competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases, and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition, and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the Company&#8217;s service. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. The Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon its ability to market and sell its indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the remediation industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, and financial condition of the Company.
