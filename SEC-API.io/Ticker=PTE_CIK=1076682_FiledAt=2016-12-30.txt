Introduction 

Majesco Entertainment Company is an innovative developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment for consumers around the world. Building on more than 25 years of operating history, Majesco develops and publishes a wide range of video games on digital networks through its Midnight City label, including Nintendo&#8217;s DS, 3DS, Wii and WiiU, Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 3 and 4, or PS3 and PS4, Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox 360 and Xbox One and the personal computer, or PC. Majesco is headquartered in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and its common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;COOL&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Although, historically, we have sold packaged console software to large retail chains, specialty retail stores, video game rental outlets and distributors and through digital distribution for platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, or PSN, and Steam, and for mobile devices and online platforms, we now operate, almost exclusively a digital software distribution and licensing business. 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2015, we transferred to Zift Interactive LLC (&#8220;Zift&#8221;), a newly-formed subsidiary, certain rights under certain of our publishing licenses related to developing, publishing, and distributing video game products through retail distribution for a term of one year. We then transferred Zift to our former chief executive officer, Jesse Sutton. 

&#160; 

Our titles are targeted at various demographics at a range of various price points. Due to the larger budget requirements for developing and marketing premium console titles, we have focused on publishing lower-cost games targeting casual-game consumers and independent game developer fans. In some instances, our titles are based on licenses of well-known properties and, in other cases, original properties. We enter into agreements with content providers and video game development studios for the creation of video games sold domestically and internationally. 

&#160; 

On December 1, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Majesco Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, PolarityTE, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Polarity&#8221;) and Dr. Denver Lough, the owner of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Polarity (the &#8220;Seller&#8221;). The closing is subject to various closing conditions. 

Company Background 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 4041-T Hadley Road, South Plainfield, NJ 07080 and our telephone number is (732) 225-8910. Our web site address is www.majescoentertainment.com. 

&#160; 

Majesco Holdings Inc. (formerly ConnectivCorp) was incorporated in 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware. As a result of a merger, Majesco Sales Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary and the sole operating business of the Company, which changed its name to Majesco Entertainment Company.

Reverse stock-split 

&#160; 

On July 27, 2016, Majesco Entertainment Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) filed a certificate of amendment (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share on a one (1) for six (6) basis, effective on July 29, 2016 (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Reverse Stock Split was effective with The NASDAQ Capital Market (&#8220;NASDAQ&#8221;) at the open of business on August 1, 2016. The par value and other terms of the Company&#8217;s common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. The Company&#8217;s post-Reverse Stock Split common stock has a new CUSIP number, 560690 406. The Company&#8217;s transfer agent, Equity Stock Transfer LLC, acted as exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every six shares of the Company&#8217;s pre-Reverse Stock Split common stock will be combined and reclassified into one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. 

&#160; 

All common share and per share amounts have been restated to show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

The video game software market is comprised of two primary sectors: (i) dedicated console software for systems such as the Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, and handheld gaming systems, such as the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS. The majority of software for these platforms has historically been purchased in packaged form through retail outlets. However, in recent years an increasing amount of software has been made available digitally through online networks such as Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live Arcade (&#8220;XBLA&#8221;), and Sony&#8217;s PlayStation Network (&#8220;PSN&#8221;); and (ii) software for multipurpose devices such as personal computers (&#8220;PCs&#8221;) and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 

Online and mobile digital games 

&#160; 

We have released numerous games for digital distribution over various third party networks for dedicated game consoles or PC, such as Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and Steam. We have released titles for various mobile platforms, including Apple&#8217;s iOS and Android. We have published our own digital games and served as a distributor for other developer&#8217;s products in return for a percentage of net revenues generated by the game. Some of the games are distributed under the label &#8220;Midnight City&#8221; which we established to provide services to the indie game development community.

Retail distribution. 

&#160; 

Prior to July 2015, we derived the majority of revenues from the sale of games for dedicated game consoles through retail distribution. Specifically, we have generated a substantial amount of our revenues in this channel from two &#8220;hit&#8221; franchises, Cooking Mama and Zumba Fitness . These titles are late in their life cycle, and as a result, generated significantly reduced sales than early in their life cycle. We have also released a number of other titles, primarily for the casual game consumer on the Nintendo DS, Nintendo WII and Microsoft 360 Kinect. Retail distribution no longer constitutes any focus of our business. 

Product Development 

&#160; 

We primarily use third party development studios to develop our games. However, we may employ game-production and quality-assurance personnel to manage the creation of the game and its ultimate approval by the first party hardware manufacturer. We carefully select third parties to develop video games based on their capabilities, suitability, availability and cost. We typically have broad rights to commercially utilize products created by the third party developers we work with. Development contracts are structured to provide developers with incentives to provide timely and satisfactory performance by associating payments with the achievement of substantive development milestones, and by providing for the payment of royalties to them based on sales of the developed product, only after we recoup development costs. 

&#160; 

The process for producing video games also involves working with platform manufacturers from the initial game concept phase through approval of the final product. During this process, we work closely with the developers and manufacturers to ensure that the title undergoes careful quality assurance testing. Each platform manufacturer requires that the software and a prototype of each title, together with all related artwork and documentation, be submitted for its pre-publication approval. This approval is generally discretionary. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our business is dependent upon intellectual property rights in numerous respects. We typically own the copyright to our software code and content and register copyrights and trademarks in the United States as appropriate. 

Platform Licenses 

&#160; 

Hardware platform manufacturers require that publishers obtain a license from them to publish titles for their platforms. We currently have non-exclusive licenses from Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony for each of the popular console and handheld platforms. Each license generally extends for a term of between two (2) to four (4) years and is terminable under a variety of circumstances. Each license allows us to create one or more products for the applicable system, and requires us to pay a per-unit license fee and/or royalty payment from the title produced and may include other compensation or payment terms. All of the hardware manufacturers approve each of the titles we submit for approval on a title-by-title basis, at their discretion. We are also dependent on approvals from distributors for our video game software for PCs and mobile devices. 

Licenses from Third Parties 

&#160; 

While we develop original titles, most of our titles are based on rights, licenses and properties, including copyrights and trademarks, owned by third parties. Even our original titles may require rights to properties from third parties, such as rights to music or content. License agreements with third parties generally extend for a term of between two (2) to four (4) years, are limited to specific territories or platforms and are terminable under a variety of circumstances. Several of our licenses are exclusive within particular territories or platforms. The licensors often have strict approval and quality control rights. Typically, we are obligated to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of these licenses and advance payments against these guarantees, but other compensation or payment terms, such as milestone payments, are also common. From time to time, we may also license other technologies from third party developers for use in our products, which also are subject to royalties and other types of payment. 

Customers 

&#160; 

Customers of our packaged software have historically been national and regional retailers, specialty retailers and video game rental outlets. Sony, Microsoft and Valve accounted for 47%, 37%, and 13%, respectively, of sales for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. For the fiscal year ended 2015, our top three accounts were Microsoft (digital), GameStop and Alliance Distributors, which accounted for approximately 13%, 10% and 10% of our revenue, respectively. In fiscal 2015, we transferred our distribution activities related to packaged software and reduced our headcount and working capital requirements dramatically in order to focus on the download business, where games are downloaded from servers maintained by game companies, such as Valve, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Accordingly, currently our customers are substantially users of games on those platforms. We continue to explore new distribution channels for our games.

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with many other first and third party publishers and developers within the video game industry. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The interactive entertainment business is highly seasonal, with sales typically higher during the peak holiday selling season during the fourth quarter of the calendar year. Traditionally, the majority of sales of our packaged software for this key selling period ship in our fiscal fourth and first quarters, which end on October 31 and January 31, respectively. Significant working capital was required to finance the manufacturing of inventory of products that shipped during these quarters. By contrast, our digital distribution activities are less subject to seasonality and do not require significant investments in inventory or accounts receivable during the holiday seasons. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had four full-time employees as of October 31, 2016.
