BUSINESS 

The discussion of the business of Entravision Communications Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, or Entravision or the Company, is as of the date of filing this report, unless otherwise indicated. 

Overview 

Introduction 

Entravision is a leading media company that reaches and engages Hispanics in the United States and certain border markets of Mexico acros s media channels and advertising platforms. Our expansive portfolio encompasses integrated marketing and media solutions, comprised of television, radio and digital properties and data analytics services. For financial reporting purposes, we report in three segments based upon the type of advertising medium: television broadcasting, radio broadcasting and digital media.

We own and/or operate 56 primary television stations located primarily in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Washington, D.C. Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision television network and Univision&#8217;s UniM&#225;s network, with television stations in 20 of the nation&#8217;s top 50 U.S. Hispanic markets. Univision&#8217;s primary network is the most watched television network (English- or Spanish-language) among U.S. Hispanic households during primetime. Univision is a key source of programming for our television broadcasting business and we consider it to be a valuable strategic partner of ours. For a more complete discussion of our relationship with Univision, please see &#8220;Our Relationship with Univision&#8221; and &#8220;Television &#8211; Television Programming&#8221; below and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Overview&#8221;; and for a discussion of various risks related to our relationship with Univision, please see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

We own and operate one of the largest groups of primarily Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. We own and operate 49 radio stations in 18 U.S. markets. Our radio stations consist of 38 FM and 11 AM stations located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. We also own and operate a national sales representation firm, Entravision Solutions, through which we sell advertisements and syndicate radio programming to approximately 350 stations across the United States.

We provide digital advertising solutions that allow advertisers to reach online Hispanic audiences in the United States and Mexico. We operate a proprietary technology and data platform that delivers digital advertising in various advertising formats to allow advertisers to reach Hispanic audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices on our owned and operated digital media sites, the digital media sites of our publisher partners, or owners of Internet and mobile sites that contain premium digital content and digital advertising inventory who provide us with access to their digital advertising inventory, and on other digital media sites we access through third-party platforms and exchanges.

We generate revenue primarily from sales of national and local advertising time on television stations, radio stations and digital media platforms, and from retransmission consent agreements that are entered into with Multichannel Video Programming Distributors, or MVPDs. Advertising rates are, in large part, based on each medium&#8217;s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers. We recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and when display or other digital advertisements record impressions on the websites of our third party publishers. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and, consequently, they may cancel, reduce or postpone orders without penalties. We pay commissions to agencies for local, regional and national advertising. For contracts directly with agencies, we record net revenue from these agencies. Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in our industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers. Our first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net revenue for the year. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during presidential election years (2016, 2020, etc.) resulting from significant political advertising and, to a lesser degree, Congressional off-year elections (2018, 2022, etc.), resulting from increased political advertising, compared to other years. 

We refer to the revenue generated by agreements with MVPDs as retransmission consent revenue, which represents payments from MVPDs for access to our television station signals so that they may rebroadcast our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. We recognize retransmission consent revenue when it is accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue. 

We also generate revenue from agreements associated with television stations in order to accommodate the operations of telecommunications operators. Revenue from such agreements is recognized when we have relinquished all rights to operate the station on the existing channel free from interference to the telecommunications operators.

Our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $254.1 million. Of this amount, revenue generated by our television segment accounted for approximately 63%, revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for approximately 30%, and revenue generated by our digital media segment accounted for approximately 7% of the total. 

Our primary expenses are employee compensation, including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms, as well as expenses for marketing, promotion and sel ling, technical, local programming, engineering, and general and administrative functions . Our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets. In addition, cost of revenue rela ted to our digital media segment consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 2425 Olympic Boulevard, Suite 6000 West, Santa Monica, California 90404, and our telephone number is (310) 447-3870. Our corporate website is www.entravision.com . 

We were organized as a Delaware limited liability company in January 1996 to combine the operations of our predecessor entities. On August 2, 2000, we completed a reorganization from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation. On August 2, 2000, we also completed an initial public offering of our Class A common stock, which is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol &#8220;EVC.&#8221; 

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to reach Hispanic audiences primarily in the United States and certain border markets of Mexico . We own and/or operate media properties in 14 of the 20 highest-density U.S. Hispanic markets. In addition, among the top 25 U.S. Hispanic markets, we own and/or operate media properties in 10 of the 15 fastest-growing markets. We believe that targeting the U.S. Hispanic market will translate into revenue growth in the future, including for the following reasons: 

&#183; 

U.S. Hispanic Population Growth . Our audience consists primarily of Hispanics, one of the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. population and, by current U.S. Census Bureau estimates, now the largest minority group in the United States. More than 55 million Hispanics live in the United States, accounting for over 17% of the total U.S. population. The overall Hispanic population is growing at eight times the rate of the non-Hispanic population and is expected to grow to 84 million, or approximately 22% of the total U.S. population, by 2032. Approximately 50% of the total future growth in the U.S. population through 2032 is expected to come from the Hispanic community. 

&#183; 

Spanish-Language Use . Approximately 75% of Hispanics age five and over in the United States speak some Spanish at home. The number of U.S. Hispanics that speak some Spanish at home is expected to grow from 34.3 million in 2010 to 56.6 million in 2030. 

&#183; 

Increasing U.S. Hispanic Buying Power. The U.S. Hispanic population is estimated to have accounted for total consumer expenditures of over $911 billion in 2012, the most recent year for which such information is available. Hispanics are expected to account for over $1 trillion in consumer expenditures by 2017, and by 2027 Hispanics are expected to account for approximately $2 trillion in consumer expenditures, or 14% of total U.S. consumer spending. Hispanic buying power is expected to grow at nearly three times the rate of the Hispanic household population growth by 2032. 

&#183; 

Attractive Profile of U.S. Hispanic Consumers. We believe that the demographic profile of the U.S. Hispanic audience makes it attractive to advertisers. We also believe that the larger average size and younger median age of Hispanic households (averaging 3.4 persons and 30.2 years of age as compared to the U.S. non-Hispanic averages of 2.4 persons and 42.9 years of age) lead Hispanics to spend more per household on many categories of goods and services. Although the average U.S. Hispanic household has less disposable income than the average U.S. household, the average U.S. Hispanic household spends 5% more per year than the average U.S. non-Hispanic household on food at home, 17% more on quick service restaurants, 66% more on children&#8217;s clothing, 42% more on footwear, 34% more on laundry and household cleaning products and 21% more on mobile telephones. We expect Hispanics to continue to account for a disproportionate share of growth in spending nationwide in many important consumer categories as the U.S. Hispanic population and its disposable income continue to grow. 

&#183; 

Spanish-Language Advertising. Over $9.4 billion of total advertising expenditures in the United States were placed with Spanish-language media in 2014, the most recent year for which such data is available, of which approximately 80% was placed with Spanish-language television and radio advertising. 

We seek to increase our revenue through the following strategies: 

Develop Unique and Compelling Content and Strong Brands While Effectively Using the Brands of Our Network Affiliates. We make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to license and create content for our television, radio and digital properties that is relevant and has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve. 

Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision primary television network and Univision&#8217;s UniM&#225;s network. According to Univision, its primary network beat one or more of the English-language broadcast networks &#8211; ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox &#8211; in primetime 89% of the time during third quarter 2015 among adults 18-34 years of age, and 79% of the time among adults 18-49 years of age. In addition, during this same time period, Univision reports that the UniM&#225;s network attracted more viewers in most key dayparts and demographic groups than the combined audiences of Azteca America, 

Estrella TV, and MundoMax. Univision&#8217;s primary network, together with its UniM&#225;s network, represented approximately a 58% share of the U.S. Spanish-language network television prime time audience of persons 2+ years of age as of May 2015 . Univision makes its networks&#8217; Spanish-language programming available to our television stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including a prime time schedule on its primary netw ork of substantially all first-run programming throughout the year. We belie ve that the breadth and diversity of Univision&#8217;s programming, combined with our local news and community-oriented segments, provide us with an advantage over other Spanish-language and English-language media in reaching U.S. Hispanic viewers. Our local content is designed to meet the needs of our communities and brand each of our stations as the best source for relevant community information that accurately reflects local interests and needs. 

We format the programming of our radio networks and radio stations in an effort to capture a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in each of our radio markets. We operate each of our three radio networks using a format designed to appeal to different listener tastes. In markets where competing stations already offer programming similar to our network formats, or where we otherwise identify an available niche in the marketplace, we run alternative programming that we believe will appeal to local listeners.

Develop Local Content, Programming and Community Involvement . We believe that local content and service to the community in each of our markets is an important part of building our brand identity and providing meaningful local service within those markets. By combining our local news, local content and quality network programming, we believe that we have a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our active community involvement, including station remote broadcasting appearances at client events, concerts and tie-ins to major events, helps to build company and station awareness and identity as well as viewer and listener loyalty. We also promote civic involvement and inform our listeners and viewers of significant developments affecting their communities. 

Distribute News and Other Content Across Our Television, Radio and Digital Properties. We develop our own news, entertainment and lifestyle content and radio shows including &#8220;Erazno y La Chokolata&#8221; , and produce a Sunday morning political talk show, &#8220;Perspectiva Nacional&#8221; . We also employ our own White House correspondent in Washington, D.C. We distribute this content across our television, radio and digital properties. In addition, through Entravision Solutions, one of our divisions, we syndicate certain of our radio shows including &#8220;Erazno y La Chokolata&#8221; and other programs including &#8220;El Show de Piolin&#8221; and &#8220;El Show de Alex &#8216;El Genio&#8217; Lucas&#8221; across a network of approximately 350 radio stations, which includes our radio stations as well as other radio stations that we do not own or operate, in 105 markets throughout the United States. 

Extend the Reach and Accessibility of Our Brands Through Digital Platforms. In recent years, we have also enhanced the distribution of our content through digital platforms, such as the Internet and mobile phones. We believe these digital platforms offer excellent opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to engage and share our content in new ways and providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with them. 

Continuing to Offer Advertisers an Integrated Platform of Services . We believe that our uniquely diversified media portfolio provides us with a competitive advantage in targeting the Hispanic consumer. We offer advertisers the opportunity to reach potential customers through an integrated platform of services that includes television, radio and digital properties. Currently, we operate some combination of television and radio in 11 markets, which we sometimes refer to as combination markets, and, where possible, we also combine our television and radio operations to create synergies and achieve cost savings. In all of our markets, our digital offerings supplement our television and/or radio operations in an effort to create value-added advertising opportunities for our advertisers. 

Continuing to Innovate and Invest in Technology and Data. We intend to continue to make investments in our digital media platforms, sales tools and research and development to further increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our television, radio and digital media advertising platforms. 

Target Strategic Acquisitions and Investments. We plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. We believe that our knowledge of, and experience with, the U.S. Hispanic marketplace will enable us to identify acquisitions of television, radio and digital properties. Since our inception, we have used our management expertise, programming, local involvement and brand identity to improve our acquired media properties and audience reach. However, we are currently subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below . 

Acquisition and Disposition Strategies 

Historically, our acquisition strategy has been focused on increasing our presence in those markets in which we already compete, as well as expanding our operations into U.S. Hispanic markets where we do not own properties. We have targeted fast-growing and high-density U.S. Hispanic markets. These have included many markets in the southwestern United States, including 

Texas, California and various other markets along the United States/Mexican border. In addition, we have pursued other acquisition opportunities in key strategic markets, or those which otherwise supported our long-term growth plans. 

One of our goals has been to create and grow our combination markets, featuring both Univision and UniM&#225;s television stations, together with a strong radio presence and digital properties. We believe that these combination markets provide unique cross-selling and cross-promotional opportunities, making us an attractive option for advertisers wishing to reach the U.S. Hispanic consumer. Accordingly, in addition to targeting media properties in U.S. Hispanic markets where we do not own media properties, we have focused on potential acquisitions of additional media properties in our existing markets that will enhance our offerings to the U.S. Hispanic marketplace. In addition, we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. 

We are subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement. We cannot at this time determine the effect that these limitations will have on our acquisition strategy or our overall business. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221;. 

In addition, we periodically review our portfolio of media properties and, from time to time, have divested non-core assets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out combination markets. We are subject to certain limitations on divestitures under the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement. We cannot at this time determine the effect that these limitations will have on our disposition strategy or our overall business. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221;. 

Our Relationship with Univision 

Substantially all of our television stations are Univision- or UniM&#225;s-affiliated television stations. Our network affiliation agreements, as amended, with Univision provide certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast Univision&#8217;s primary network and UniM&#225;s network programming in their respective markets. These long-term affiliation agreements each expire in 2021, and can be renewed for multiple, successive two-year terms at Univision&#8217;s option, subject to our consent. Under our Univision network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell approximately six minutes per hour of the available advertising time on Univision&#8217;s primary network, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision, but in no event less than four minutes. Under our UniM&#225;s network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell approximately four and a half minutes per hour of the available advertising time on the UniM&#225;s network, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision. 

Under the network affiliation agreements, Univision acts as our exclusive third-party sales representative for the sale of national advertising on our Univision- and UniM&#225;s-affiliate television stations, and we pay certain sales representation fees to Univision relating to sales of all advertising for broadcast on our Univision- and UniM&#225;s-affiliate television stations. 

We also generate revenue under two marketing and sales agreements with Univision, which give us the right through 2021 to manage the marketing and sales operations of Univision-owned UniM&#225;s and Univision affiliates in six markets &#8211; Albuquerque, Boston, Denver, Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C. 

In August 2008, we entered into a proxy agreement with Univision pursuant to which we granted to Univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our Univision- and UniM&#225;s-affiliated television station signals for a term of six years, expiring in December 2014, which Univision and we have extended through March 31, 2016. Among other things, the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by Univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with MVPDs. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, retransmission consent revenue accounted for approximately $27.9 million and $26.4 million, respectively. The term of the proxy agreement extends with respect to any MVPD for the length of the term of any retransmission consent agreement in effect before the expiration of the proxy agreement. It is our current intention to negotiate with Univision an extension of the current proxy agreement or a new proxy agreement; however, no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any such extension or new agreement or that any such extension or new agreement will be entered into. 

Univision currently owns approximately 10% of our common stock on a fully-converted basis. Our Class U common stock held by Univision has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors. As the holder of all of our issued and outstanding Class U common stock, so long as Univision holds a certain number of shares, we may not, without the consent of Univision, merge, consolidate or enter into another business combination, dissolve or liquidate our company or dispose of any interest in any Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, license for any of our Univision-affiliated television stations, among other things. Each share of Class U common stock is automatically convertible into one share of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends or combinations) in connection with any transfer to a third party that is not an affiliate of Univision. 

Television 

Overview 

We own and/or operate Univision-affiliated television stations in 24 markets, including 20 of the top 50 Hispanic markets in the United States. Our television operations comprise the largest affiliate group of both the top-ranked Univision primary television network and Univision&#8217;s UniM&#225;s network. Univision&#8217;s primary network is the leading Spanish-language network in the United States, reaching approximately 97% of all U.S. Hispanic households, and is the most watched television network (English- or Spanish-language) among U.S. Hispanic households during prime time. Univision&#8217;s primary network, together with its UniM&#225;s network, represent approximately a 58% share of the U.S. Spanish-language network television prime time audience of persons 2+ years of age as of May 2015. We operate both Univision and UniM&#225;s affiliates in 20 of our 24 television markets. Univision&#8217;s networks make their Spanish-language programming available to our Univision-affiliated stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Univision&#8217;s prime time schedule on its primary network consists of substantially all first-run programming throughout the year. 

Television Programming 

Univision Primary Network Programming . Univision directs its programming primarily toward a young, family-oriented audience. It begins daily with Despierta America, a drama show and another talk show, Monday through Friday, followed by novelas. In the late afternoon and early evening, Univision offers an entertainment magazine, a news magazine and national news, in addition to local news produced by our television stations. During prime time, Univision airs novelas, as well as specials. Prime time is followed by late news. Overnight programming consists primarily of repeats of programming aired previously on the network. Weekend daytime programming begins with children&#8217;s programming, and is generally followed by sports, reality, comedy shows and movies. 

Approximately eight to ten hours of programming per weekday, including a substantial portion of weekday prime time, are currently programmed with novelas supplied primarily by Grupo Televisa, S.A. de C.V., or Televisa, and Corporacion Venezolana de Television, C.A., or Venevision. Although novelas have been compared to daytime soap operas on ABC, NBC or CBS, the differences are significant. Novelas, originally developed as serialized books, have a beginning, middle and end, generally run five days per week and conclude four to eight months after they begin. Novelas also have a much broader audience appeal than soap operas, delivering audiences that contain large numbers of men, children and teens, in addition to women, unlike soap operas, whose audiences are primarily women. 

UniM&#225;s Network Programming . Univision&#8217;s other 24-hour general-interest Spanish-language broadcast network, UniM&#225;s, is programmed to meet the diverse preferences of the multi-faceted U.S. Hispanic community. UniM&#225;s&#8217;s programming includes sports (including boxing, soccer and a nightly wrap-up at 11 p.m. similar to ESPN&#8217;s programming), movies (including a mix of English-language movies translated into Spanish) and novelas not run on Univision&#8217;s primary network, as well as reruns of popular novelas broadcast on Univision&#8217;s primary network. 

Our Local Programming . We believe that our local news brands our stations in our television markets. We shape our local news to relate to and inform our audiences. In 12 of our television markets, our early local news is ranked first or second among competing local newscasts regardless of language in its designated time slot among adults 18-49 years of age. We have made substantial investments in people and equipment in order to provide our local communities with quality newscasts. Our local newscasts have won numerous awards, and we strive to be the most important community voice in each of our local markets. In several of our markets, we believe that our local news is the only significant source of Spanish-language daily news for the Hispanic community. 

Network Affiliation Agreements . Substantially all of our television stations are Univision- or UniM&#225;s-affiliated television stations. Our network affiliation agreements with Univision provide certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast Univision&#8217;s primary network and UniM&#225;s network programming in their respective markets. These long-term affiliation agreements each expire in 2021, and can be renewed for multiple, successive two-year terms at Univision&#8217;s option, subject to our consent. Under our Univision network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell approximately six minutes per hour of the available advertising time on Univision&#8217;s primary network, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision, but in no event less than four minutes. Under our UniM&#225;s network affiliation agreement, we retain the right to sell approximately four and a half minutes per hour of the available advertising time on the UniM&#225;s network, subject to adjustment from time to time by Univision. 

XHAS-TV broadcasts Telemundo Network Group LLC, or Telemundo, network programming serving the Tijuana/San Diego market pursuant to a network affiliation agreement. Our current network affiliation agreement with Telemundo gives us the right to provide Telemundo network programming on XHAS-TV through June 2017. The affiliation agreement grants Telemundo a right of first refusal in the event a third party makes an offer to purchase XHAS-TV, and a right to purchase XHAS-TV upon a change of control of our company. 

Our network affiliation agreement with Fox Broadcasting Company, or Fox, gives us the right to broadcast Fox network programming on KFXV-LD, serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, and KXOF-CA, serving the Laredo market, through December 31, 2017. The network affiliation agreement may be extended for successive one-year terms at Fox&#8217;s option, subject to our consent. 

Our network affiliation agreements with Mundo TV LLC, or MundoMax, gives us the right to broadcast MundoMax network programming on XHRIO-TV, serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, and on XDTV-TV, serving the Tecate/San Diego market, through July 31, 2018, and on the secondary program stream of KXOF-CD, serving the Laredo market, the secondary program stream of KTFN-TV, serving the El Paso market, and the secondary program stream of KVYE-TV, serving the Yuma-El Centro market through July 31, 2016. 

We also have an agreement with Master Distribution Service, Inc., an affiliate of Fox, which gives us the right to provide ten hours per week of MyNetworkTV programming on KFXV-LD, KXOF-CD and on the secondary program stream of XDTV-TV, serving the Tecate/San Diego market. This agreement expires in October 2016 and may be extended for successive one-year periods by mutual consent of the parties. 

Our network affiliation agreement with The CW Network, LLC, or CW, gives us the right to broadcast CW network programming on KCWT-CD and on the secondary program stream of KNVO-TV serving the Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, and on KRNS-CD and on the secondary program stream of KREN-TV, serving the Reno, Nevada market, through 2018. 

Our network affiliation agreement with LATV Networks, LLC, or LATV, gives us the right to broadcast LATV network programming on the digital streams of certain of our television stations. Either party may terminate the affiliation with respect to a given station 30 months after the launch of such station. For a more complete discussion of this agreement, please see Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We cannot guarantee that any of our current network affiliation agreements will be renewed beyond their respective expiration dates under their current terms, under terms satisfactory to us, or at all. 

Marketing Agreements. Our marketing and sales agreement with Univision gives us the right through 2021 to manage the marketing and sales operations of Univision-owned UniM&#225;s and Univision affiliates in six markets &#8211; Albuquerque, Boston, Denver, Orlando, Tampa and Washington, D.C. We have also entered into marketing and sales agreements with other parties in certain of our other markets. 

Long-Term Time Brokerage Agreements . We operate each of XDTV-TV, serving the Tecate/San Diego market; XHAS-TV, serving the Tijuana/San Diego market; and XHRIO-TV, serving the Matamoros/Harlingen-Weslaco-Brownsville-McAllen market, under long-term time brokerage agreements. Under those agreements, in combination with certain of our Mexican affiliates and subsidiaries, we provide the programming and related services available on these stations, but the stations retain absolute control of the content and other broadcast issues. These long-term time brokerage agreements expire in 2038, 2040 and 2045, respectively, and each provides for automatic, perpetual 30-year renewals unless both parties consent to termination. Each of these agreements provides for substantial financial penalties should the other party attempt to terminate prior to its expiration without our consent, and they do not limit the availability of specific performance as a remedy for any such attempted early termination.

(1) 

&#8220;CD&#8221; in call signs indicates station is under Class A television service. Certain stations without this designation are also Class A stations. 

(2) 

We provide programming broadcast on the station through an agreement with the station owner.

(3) 

We provide the sales and marketing function of this station under a marketing and sales arrangement. 

(4) 

We share operating services with another broadcast station in the same market under a shared services arrangement. 

(5) 

We hold a minority, limited voting interest (neutral investment) in the entity that directly or indirectly holds the broadcast license for this station. Through that entity, we provide the programming and related services available on this station under a time brokerage arrangement. The station retains control of the contents and other broadcast issues. 

Digital Television Technology. As we continue to develop our digital television transmission technology for our television stations, we are operating in an environment where we can decide the resolution and number of broadcast streams we provide in our over-the-air transmissions. Depending upon how high a resolution level with which we elect to transmit our programming, we have the potential to transmit over-the-air broadcast streams containing multiple program streams using the bandwidth authorized to each digital station. The transmission of such multiple programming streams is referred to as multicasting. We currently are multicasting network programming streams, primarily UniM&#225;s network programming and LATV network programming streams, at a number of our stations, along with our primary program streams. In addition, we are multicasting CW, MundoMax, MyNetworkTV and other network programming in certain of our markets. We periodically evaluate these multicasting operations as well as the amount of bandwidth we must allocate to our primary program streams and may consider either expanding or limiting our multicasting operations, or keeping these multicasting operations substantially as at present, in the future. 

Television Advertising 

Approximately 76% of the revenue generated from our television operations in 2015 was derived from local and national advertising. 

Local . Local advertising revenue is generated predominantly from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from within a station&#8217;s market or directly with a station&#8217;s sales staff. Local advertising sales include sales to advertisers that are local businesses or advertising agencies, and regional and national businesses or advertising agencies, which place orders from within a station&#8217;s market or directly with a station&#8217;s sales staff. We employ our own local sales force that is responsible for soliciting local advertising sales directly from advertisers and their agencies. In 2015, local advertising accounted for approximately 44% of our total television revenue. 

National . National advertising revenue generally represents revenue from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from outside a station&#8217;s market. We typically engage national sales representative firms to work with our station sales managers and solicit national advertising sales, and we pay certain sales representation fees to these firms relating to national advertising sales. Under our network affiliation agreements with Univision, Univision acts as our sales representative for the sale of 

national advertising on our Univision and UniM&#225;s affiliate television stations, and advertisers which have purchased national advertising on these affiliate stations include Cox Communications, Inc., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., McDonald&#8217;s Corporation, F ord Motor Company, H-E-B, Conn&#8217;s, Inc., Jack in the Box Inc . , Toyota Motor Corporation and General Motors Company . Telemundo acts as our national sales representative for the sale of national advertising on our Telemundo affiliate station, and Entravision Solutions, one of our divisions, acts as our national sales representative for the sale of national advertising on our stations that broadcast Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV network programming. In 201 5 , national advertising accounted for approximately 32 % of our total television revenue. 

Retransmission Consent Revenue . We generate retransmission consent revenue from retransmission consent agreements that are entered into with MVPDs. This revenue represents payments from these entities for access to our television station signals so that they may rebroadcast our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. In addition, we generally pay either a per subscriber fee or a share of the retransmission consent revenue received from MVPDs to the related networks, which we refer to as reverse network compensation. 

In August 2008, we entered into a proxy agreement with Univision pursuant to which we granted to Univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our Univision- and UniM&#225;s-affiliated television station signals for a term of six years, expiring in December 2014, which Univision and we have extended through March 31, 2016. Among other things, the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by Univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with MVPDs. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, retransmission consent revenue accounted for approximately $27.9 million and $26.4 million, respectively. The term of the proxy agreement extends with respect to any MVPD for the length of the term of any retransmission consent agreement in effect before the expiration of the proxy agreement. It is our current intention to negotiate with Univision an extension of the current proxy agreement or a new proxy agreement; however, no assurance can be given regarding the terms of any such extension or new agreement or that any such extension or new agreement will be entered into. 

In 2015, retransmission consent revenue accounted for approximately 17% of our total television revenue. We anticipate that retransmission consent revenue will continue to be a growing source of net revenues in future periods. 

Channel Modification Revenue . We also generate revenue from agreements associated with television stations in order to accommodate the operations of telecommunications operators. In 2015, revenue from such agreements accounted for approximately 7% of our total television revenue . 

Television Marketing/Audience Research 

We derive our revenue primarily from selling advertising time. The relative advertising rates charged by competing stations within a market depend primarily on the following factors: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the station&#8217;s ratings (households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of total television households or people in the viewing area); 

&#160;

&#183; 

audience share (households or people viewing its programs as a percentage of households or people actually watching television at a specific time); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demographic qualities of a program&#8217;s viewers (primarily age and gender); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demand for available air time; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the time of day the advertising will run; 

&#160;

&#183; 

competitive conditions in the station&#8217;s market, including the availability of other advertising media; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

general economic conditions, including advertisers&#8217; budgetary considerations. 

Nielsen ratings provide advertisers with the industry-accepted measure of television viewing. Nielsen offers a ratings service measuring all television audience viewing. In recent years, Nielsen has modified the methodology of its ratings service in an effort to more accurately measure U.S. Hispanic viewing by using language spoken in the home as a control characteristic of its metered market sample. Nielsen has also added weighting by language as part of its local metered market methodology in many of our metered markets. Nielsen also continues to improve the methods by which it electronically measures television viewing, and has expanded its Local People Meter service to several of our markets. We believe that this improvement will continue to result in ratings gains for us, allowing us to further increase our advertising rates. We have made significant investments in experienced sales managers and account executives and have provided our sales professionals with research tools to continue to attract major advertisers. 

Television Competition 

We face intense competition in the television broadcasting business. In each local television market, we compete for viewers and revenue with other local television stations, which are typically the local affiliates of the four principal English-language television networks, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox and, in certain cities, the CW network. In certain markets (other than San Diego), we also compete with the local affiliates or owned and operated stations of Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network now owned by Comcast, as well as TV Azteca, the second-largest producer of Spanish-language programming in the world. 

We also directly or indirectly compete for viewers and revenue with both English- and Spanish-language independent television stations, other video media, suppliers of cable television programs, direct broadcast systems, newspapers, magazines, radio, applications for mobile media devices and other forms of entertainment and advertising. In addition, in certain markets we operate radio stations that indirectly compete for local and national advertising revenue with our television business. 

We believe that our primary competitive advantages are the quality of the programming we receive through our affiliation with Univision and the quality of our local news. According to Univision, its primary network is one of the top five networks in the United States regardless of language and is the most-watched Spanish-language network in the United States during prime time. In addition, Univision reports that its primary network and the UniM&#225;s network together have maintained superior audience ratings among all U.S. Hispanic households when compared to both Spanish-language and English-language broadcast networks. Similarly, our local news achieves strong audience ratings. In 12 of our television markets, our early local news is ranked first or second among competing local newscasts regardless of language in its designated time slot among adults 18-49 years of age. 

Telemundo is the second-largest provider of Spanish-language content worldwide. Telemundo&#8217;s multiple platforms include the Telemundo Network, a Spanish-Language television network featuring original productions, theatrical motion pictures, news and first class sports events. 

We also benefit from operating in different media: television and radio advertising. While we have not engaged in any significant cross-selling program, we do take advantage of opportunities for cross-promotion of our stations. 

Radio 

Overview 

We own and operate 49 radio stations (38 FM and 11 AM), 48 of which are located in the top 50 Hispanic markets in the United States and a national sales representation firm, Entravision Solutions. Our radio stations broadcast into markets with an aggregate of approximately 20 million U.S. Hispanics, which is approximately 40% of the Hispanic population in the United States. Our radio operations combine network and local programming with local time slots available for advertising, news, traffic, weather, promotions and community events. This strategy allows us to provide quality programming with significantly lower costs of operations than we could otherwise deliver solely with all local programming. 

Radio Programming 

Radio Networks . Our networks allow advertisers with national product distribution to deliver a uniform advertising message to the growing Hispanic market around the country in an efficient manner. 

Although our networks have a broad geographic reach, technology allows our stations to offer the necessary local feel and to be responsive to local clients and community needs. Designated time slots are used for local advertising, news, traffic, weather, promotions and community events. The audience gets the benefit of a national radio sound along with local content. To further enhance this effect, our on-air personalities frequently travel to participate in local promotional events. For example, in selected key markets our on-air personalities appear at special events and client locations. We promote these events as &#8220;remotes&#8221; to bond the national personalities to local listeners. Furthermore, all of our stations can disconnect from the networks and operate independently in the case of a local emergency or a problem with our central Multiprotocol Label Switching, or MPLS, transmission. 

Radio Formats . Each of our three radio networks produce a music format that is simultaneously distributed via MPLS with a High Definition quality sound to our stations. Each of these formats appeals to different listener preferences: 

&#160;

&#183; 

&#8220; La Tricolor &#8221; is a personality-driven format, primarily targeting male Hispanic listeners 18-49 years of age, that includes &#8220;El Show de Piolin&#8221; in the morning drive, which airs on 16 of our stations, &#8220; El Pajarete&#8221; during midday hours, which airs on 13 of our stations, &#8220;Erazno y La Chokolata&#8221; in the afternoon drive, which airs on 17 of our stations and is syndicated on an additional 62 stations, and Mexican regional music; 

&#160;

&#183; 

&#8220;Jos&#233;: Nunca Sabes Lo Que Va A Tocar&#8221; (&#8220;You never know what he&#8217;ll play&#8221;), which targets Hispanic adults 25-54 years of age, features a mix of Spanish-language adult contemporary and Mexican regional hits from the 1970s through the present; 

&#160;

&#8220; El Genio &#8221; Alex Lucas in the mornings; &#8220; Curvas Peligrosas &#8221;, a nutritionally-focused program that educates Hispanics on healthy lifestyles; &#8220; LMS Show &#8221;, featuring Latino celebrity news and entertainment in the evenings; and play-b y-play soccer coverage of the Mexican national team, including coverage of the 201 8 World Cup ; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

&#8220;Super Estrella&#8221; , which primarily targets Hispanic adults 18-49 years of age, airs in four of our markets and features the best Spanish-language contemporary artists. 

Our radio networks are broadcast into 15 of the 18 radio markets that we serve. In addition, in markets where competing stations already offer programming similar to our network formats, or where we otherwise identify an available niche in the marketplace, we run alternative programming that we believe will appeal to local listeners, including the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

In the El Paso market, we program &#8220;The Fox&#8221;, an English-language format that features classic rock and pop hits from the 1960s through the 1980s and targets primarily adults 25-54 years of age; 

&#160;

&#183; 

In the McAllen market, we program a Mexican country-style music format that targets primarily Hispanic males 18-49 years of age that includes &#8220;El Show de Piolin&#8221; in the morning drive; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Also in the McAllen market, we program two English-language formats, a classic rock-oriented format that targets primarily males 18-49 years of age and a hit-based adult contemporary format targeting primarily women 18-49 years of age; 

&#160;

&#183; 

In the Orlando market, we program &#8220;Salsa 98.1&#8221; , a Spanish-language tropical hits format that features salsa, merengue and bachata and targets Hispanic adults 25-54 years of age; 

&#160;

&#183; 

In the Phoenix, El Paso, Lubbock, Stockton, Houston and Albuquerque markets, we program &#8220;ESPN Deportes&#8221;, a Spanish-language sports talk format targeting primarily Hispanic adults 18-54 years of age, that is provided to us by a third party pursuant to a network affiliation agreement; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

In the Sacramento market, we program two English-language formats, a rhythmic contemporary hit format targeting primarily females 18-34 years of age and a young country format targeting primarily adults 18-49 years of age.

Radio Advertising 

Substantially all of the revenue generated from our radio operations is derived from local and national advertising. 

Local . Local advertising revenue is generated predominantly from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from within a station&#8217;s market or directly with a station&#8217;s sales staff, and also from a third-party network inventory agreement, digital, and non-traditional revenue. Local advertising sales include sales to advertisers that are local businesses or advertising agencies, and regional and national businesses or advertising agencies, which place orders from within a station&#8217;s market or directly with a station&#8217;s sales staff. We employ our own local sales force, in each of our markets, that is responsible for soliciting local advertising sales directly from advertisers and their agencies. In 2015, local advertising revenue accounted for approximately 64% of our total radio revenue. 

National . National advertising revenue generally represents spot and network revenue from advertising time sold to an advertiser or its agency that is placed from outside a station&#8217;s market. Entravision Solutions, one of our divisions, typically acts as a national sales representative to solicit national advertising sales on our Spanish-language radio stations. In 2015, national advertising revenue accounted for approximately 36% of our total radio revenue. 

Radio Marketing/Audience Research 

We believe that radio is an efficient means for advertisers to reach targeted demographic groups. Advertising rates charged by our radio stations are based primarily on the following factors: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the station&#8217;s ratings (people listening to its programs as a percentage of total people in the listening area); 

&#160;

&#183; 

audience share (people listening to its programs as a percentage of people actually listening to radio at a specific time); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demographic qualities of a program&#8217;s listeners (primarily age and gender); 

&#160;

&#183; 

the demand for available air time; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the time of day that the advertising runs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

competitive conditions in the station&#8217;s market, including the availability of other advertising media; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

general economic conditions, including advertisers&#8217; budgetary considerations. 

Nielsen Audio provides advertisers with the industry-accepted measure of listening audience classified by demographic segment and time of day that the listeners spend on particular radio stations. Radio advertising rates generally are highest during the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. These hours are considered the peak times for radio audience listening. 

Historically, advertising rates for Spanish-language radio stations have been lower than those for English-language stations with similar audience levels. We believe that, over time, possibilities exist to narrow the disparities that have historically existed between Spanish-language and English-language advertising rates as new and existing advertisers recognize the growing desirability of the U.S. Hispanic population as an advertising target. For example, U.S. Hispanics spend more on consumer packaged goods (including foods, adult beverages, household products, health and beauty aids and over-the-counter medications) than the national average. We also believe that having multiple stations in a market enables us to provide listeners with alternatives, to secure a higher overall percentage of a market&#8217;s available advertising dollars, and to obtain greater percentages of individual customers&#8217; advertising budgets.

Each station broadcasts an optimal number of advertisements each hour, depending upon its format, in order to maximize the station&#8217;s revenue without jeopardizing its audience listenership. Our non-network stations have up to 14 minutes per hour for commercial inventory and local content. Our network stations have up to one additional minute of commercial inventory per hour. The pricing is based on a rate card and negotiations subject to the supply and demand for the inventory in each particular market and the network. 

Radio Competition 

We face intense competition in the radio broadcasting business. The financial success of each of our radio stations and markets depends in large part on our audience ratings, our ability to increase our market share of overall radio advertising revenue and the economic health of the market. In addition, our advertising revenue depends upon the desire of advertisers to reach our audience demographic. Each of our radio stations competes for audience share and advertising revenue directly with both Spanish-language and English-language radio stations in its market, and with other media, such as newspapers, broadcast and cable television, magazines, outdoor advertising, satellite-delivered radio services, applications for mobile media devices and other forms of digital delivery, and direct mail advertising. In addition, in certain markets we operate television stations that indirectly compete for local and national advertising revenue with our radio business. Our primary competitors in our markets in Spanish-language radio are Univision, Clear 

Channel Communications Inc. and Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. These and many of the other companies with which we compete are large national or regional companies that have sign ificantly greater resources and longer operating histories than we do. 

Factors that are material to our competitive position include management experience, a station&#8217;s rank in its market, signal strength and audience demographics. If a competing station within a market converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors upgrades its stations, we could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue in that market. The audience ratings and advertising revenue of our individual stations are subject to fluctuation and any adverse change in certain of our key radio markets could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

The radio industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as: 

&#160;

&#183; 

audio programming by cable television systems, broadcast satellite-delivered audio services, cellular telephones and smart telephones, including easy-to-use mobile applications, Internet content providers, and other digital audio broadcast formats and playback mechanisms; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satellite-delivered digital audio services with CD-quality sound&#8212;with both commercial-free and lower commercial load channels&#8212;which have expanded their subscriber base and have introduced dedicated Spanish-language channels; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

In-Band On-Channel&#8482; digital radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional FM radio services. 

We believe that while none of these new technologies can replace local broadcast radio stations, the challenges from new technologies will continue to require attention from management. In addition, we will continue to review potential opportunities to utilize such new technologies. 

Digital

Overview

We provide digital advertising solutions that allow advertisers to reach online Hispanic audiences in the United States and Mexico. We operate a proprietary technology and data platform that delivers digital advertising in various advertising formats to allow advertisers to reach Hispanic audiences across a wide range of Internet-connected devices on our owned and operated digital media sites, the digital media sites of our publisher partners, or owners of Internet and mobile sites that contain premium digital content and digital advertising inventory who provide us with access to their digital advertising inventory, and on other digital media sites we access through third-party platforms and exchanges. We access data from these digital media sites and apply our proprietary data analytics capabilities to better target and aggregate Hispanic audience segments that will be relevant to individual advertisers, while allowing the publishers of digital media sites to better sell their digital advertising inventory.

Our Solutions and Technology Platform

Through our Pulpo Media, Inc. (&#8220;Pulpo&#8221;) advertising network, we offer advertisers the opportunity to reach and engage with their target audiences by providing access to premium digital inventory in brand safe environments at scale across a wide range of devices. Our significant audience reach, access to a large volume of digital advertising space, sophisticated targeting capabilities and broad array of advertising formats allow us to deliver marketing solutions that can help grow our clients&#8217; businesses. We also enable advertisers to gain insights into the performance of their advertising campaigns and manage those campaigns with a view toward maximizing return on their advertising investment. 

We believe that key benefits of our digital advertising solutions include the following:

Sophisticated targeting. Our platform and solutions specifically identify and reach online Hispanic audiences, which we refer to as &#8220;(i)Hispanics&#8221;, across a wide range of Internet-connected devices. 

We believe that one of the main strengths of our platform is that it accesses and analyzes large amounts of data to provide a unique, multidimensional view of individual consumer profiles of (i)Hispanics at all levels of acculturation within the United States. We refer to this analysis as our proprietary (i)Hispanic acculturation model, which analyzes data such as generational status, age of entry into the U.S., amount of time spent living in the U.S., language preference and English proficiency, demographic data, geographic information and online behavioral knowledge, to provide advertisers with valuable insights and better understanding of Hispanic audiences and consumers. This understanding allows advertisers to more effectively reach Hispanic consumers across all acculturation levels in the U.S. and engage with them more effectively.

We have also developed a number of audience categories to which advertisers can target their ads. Audience categories can be based on a variety of user attributes, including location, demographics, affluence, intent, gender and interests. We identify these 

attributes and audience categories based upon information we have gathered about online users&#8217; online activity on an ano nymous basis, a process known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. We analyze this data to build sophisticated us er profiles and audience groups that, in combination with our proprietary (i )Hispanic acculturation model and the real-time deci sion -making , optimization and targeting capabilities of our platform, enable s us to deliver highly targeted advertising campaigns for our advertiser clients , as well as analytics to help them better understand Hispanic audiences and consumers . As we delive r more ads, we are able to collect additional information about users, audiences and the effectiveness of particular ad campaigns, which in turn enhances our targeting capabilities and allows us to deliver better performance for advertisers and better oppo rtunities for our publisher partner s to increase their revenue streams. In addition, a dvertisers are willing to pay a higher rate for digital advertising when deeper consumer data can be used to help them make their decisions a bout purchasing advertising a nd to engage with the consumers whom they desire to reach . 

Premium content. We provide our advertiser clients with access to premium digital content, which is professionally produced and we believe offers a quality viewing experience, through our owned and operated digital media sites and those of our publisher partners. This enables publishers to more effectively monetize their digital content, and enables advertisers to more effectively reach audiences who engage with such premium content. 

Scale and reach across a range of Internet-connected devices. We enable advertisers to use our digital media advertising solutions to address their online and mobile advertising needs to reach their desired audiences at scale across a wide range of Internet-connected devices, including computers, smartphones and tablets. 

Variety of advertising formats . We enable advertisers to deliver a variety of advertising formats, including video ads, display banners, rich media and native ad formats. We believe that these advertising formats provide an opportunity for advertisers to create a variety of advertising content that increases audience interaction and engagement, which in turn drives better results for advertisers. 

Brand safety. Our proprietary technology contextually evaluates the content of digital media sites on which we deliver ads in order to identify content that is most appropriate or desirable for an individual advertiser, and also ensure that ads are not being delivered within content that is identified as objectionable to the advertiser, such as content that contains distasteful or obscene language, violence, gambling, sex or criminal activity. We believe that the combination of our practice of selecting publisher partners and our proprietary technology provides a high level of brand safety for our advertisers. 

Digital Advertising

We provide our advertisers with opportunities to reach their target audiences through brand advertising and performance-based advertising. Brand advertising is generally intended to establish a long-term, positive consumer attitude toward an advertiser or its product or service, and brand advertisers typically measure campaign effectiveness using metrics such as reach (how many consumers within the advertiser&#8217;s target audience were exposed to the advertisement) and frequency (how many times the consumer within the target audience was exposed to the advertisement). Performance-based advertising is generally intended to induce a specific action, such as clicking on an advertisement, and direct response advertisers typically measure campaign effectiveness using metrics related to consumer response to an advertisement. 

We generate digital revenue by delivering digital advertisements on digital media sites across a wide range of Internet-connected online and mobile devices. Advertisers and agencies typically purchase advertising from us through campaigns that are sold and managed by our direct sales force, which we refer to as managed campaigns. Managed campaigns provide advertisers with a higher degree of &#8220;white glove&#8221; customer service, with dedicated account teams that use an automated platform to deliver advertising campaigns for advertisers. 

We typically contract with advertisers or agencies through insertion orders, which set forth campaign parameters such as size and duration of the campaign, type of advertising format and pricing. Digital advertising customers submit ad insertion orders to us and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital advertisements to audiences through digital media properties. We are typically paid by advertisers on the basis of the number of viewer impressions to whom an advertisement is delivered, known as a cost per thousand basis, and we generally pay our publisher partners a negotiated percentage of this revenue. Prior to running an advertising campaign, the advertiser or agency may work with our creative team to provide the creative direction of the campaign and design in order to most effectively reach the audiences most desirable to it.

Our Digital Customers

Our digital customer base consists primarily of advertisers of all sizes and the advertising agencies that represent them. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had over 2,000 advertising clients, including top brand advertisers from nearly all major industries, including automotive, consumer products, services, healthcare, telecommunications, travel, retail, finance and media. Digital revenue from individual advertisers varies from period to period. We do not believe that our business is substantially dependent upon any 

individual advertiser, and no individual advertiser represented more than 5 % of our digital revenue for the year ended December 31, 201 5 . 

Our Digital Publisher Network

We have contractual relationships with premium publishers, or owners of sites that contain premium digital content and provide digital advertising inventory. We consider a premium publisher to be a publisher that has content that is professionally produced and offers a quality viewing experience . These relationships provide us with digital advertising inventory, which we utilize to deliver our digital advertising solutions to our digital advertising customers. We engage our publisher partners through a variety of methods, including outreach by a dedicated business development team. We do not believe that the success of our business is dependent on our relationship with any single publisher partner. 

We seek to identify owners of digital media properties featuring premium digital content that, individually or collectively, have the audience scale, composition and accessibility across Internet-connected devices to achieve the objectives of our advertisers. We review a variety of criteria to determine the quality of the advertising inventory and its appropriateness for our advertiser clients, including content, the characteristics of the publisher&#8217;s viewing audience, the targeting attributes that can be obtained from the digital media property in real time and the volume of available digital content and impressions. 

Digital Competition

The digital advertising market is dynamic, rapidly changing and highly competitive, influenced by trends in both the overall advertising market as well as the digital advertising market. We compete with large online digital publishers such as Hulu, LLC and YouTube, LLC, which is owned by Google, Inc., as well as other publishers who rely on their own sales organizations to attract advertisers to their digital properties. Across the digital media landscape, we compete for advertising purchases with large entities such as Google Inc., Facebook, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, AOL Inc. and Yahoo! Inc., all of whom offer digital advertising services as part of a larger solution for digital media buying, as well as other advertising technology companies and advertising networks. In the traditional media space, our digital operations also compete for advertising commitments with TV broadcasters, cable TV broadcasters, radio broadcasters, print media and other traditional publishers. Many of our competitors have significant client relationships, much larger financial resources and longer operating histories in this space than we have.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include effective audience targeting capabilities, multi-device campaign delivery capability, proven and scalable technologies, audience scale and reach, relationships with leading advertisers and their respective agencies, brand awareness and reputation, ability to gather and use data to deliver more relevant ads, ability to ensure brand safety, ability to prevent click fraud and use of analytics to effectively measure performance. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well-positioned to be a leading provider of digital advertising solutions to reach Hispanic audiences in the United States and Mexico.

Seasonality 

Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in the television and radio broadcasting and digital media industries and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers. Our first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net revenue for the year. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during presidential election years (2016, 2020, etc.) resulting from significant political advertising and, to a lesser degree, Congressional off-year elections (2018, 2022, etc.), resulting from increased political advertising, compared to other years. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that our ability to protect our intellectual property is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets law, copyrights, trademarks and contracts. We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.

In the course of our business, we use various trademarks, trade names and service marks, including our logos and FCC call letters, in our advertising and promotions, as well as proprietary technology platforms and other technology. Some of our technology relies upon third party licensed intellectual property. We do not hold or depend upon any material patent, government license, franchise or concession, except our broadcast licenses granted by the FCC. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,165 full-time employees worldwide. Approximately 1,073 of those full-time employees are in the United States, including 701 full-time employees in television, 350 full-time employees in radio, and 22 full-time employees in digital. As of December 31, 2015, three of our full-time television employees in the United States were represented by a labor union that has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us. Our 24 full-time and four part-time employees in Mexico are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which runs until January 31, 2018. We also have 68 full-time and two part-time employees in Argentina, who work on our digital operations and who are not members of a union or collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relations with our employees and these unions generally are good.

Regulation of Television and Radio Broadcasting 

General . The FCC regulates television and radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, or the Communications Act. Among other things, the FCC: 

&#160;

&#183; 

determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of stations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

issues, renews, revokes and modifies station licenses; 

&#160;

&#183; 

regulates equipment used by stations; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, changes in ownership, control, operation and employment practices of stations. 

A licensee&#8217;s failure to observe the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of renewal terms of less than eight years, the grant of a license renewal with conditions or, in the case of particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. 

Congress and the FCC have had under consideration or reconsideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our television and radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our television and radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional television and radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters may include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

changes to the license authorization process; 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals to impose a performance tax on the music broadcast on commercial radio stations and the fees applicable to digital transmission of music on the Internet; 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free airtime to candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages; 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals dealing with the broadcast of profane, indecent or obscene language and the consequences to a broadcaster for permitting such speech; 

&#160;

&#183; 

technical and frequency allocation matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

modifications to the operating rules for digital television and radio broadcasting rules on both satellite and terrestrial bases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the implementation or modification of rules governing the carriage of local television signals by direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, services and cable television systems and the manner in which such parties negotiate such carriage arrangements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

changes in local and national broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution rules; 

&#160;

&#183; 

changes in the procedures whereby full-service broadcast stations are carried on multichannel video programming providers (MVPDs) (cable television and direct-broadcast satellite systems) either on a must-carry or retransmission consent basis and how compensation systems and processes involving broadcasters and MVPDs might be modified; 

&#160;

&#183; 

changes in the operating rules and policies for AM broadcasting; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions. 

We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted, nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future, nor can we judge in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposal or change might have on our bu siness. 

FCC Licenses . Television and radio stations operate pursuant to licenses that are granted by the FCC for a term of eight years, subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. During the periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. The FCC may hold hearings on renewal applications if it is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a &#8220;substantial and material question of fact&#8221; as to whether the grant of the renewal applications would be inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. However, the FCC is prohibited from considering competing applications for a renewal applicant&#8217;s frequency, and is required to grant the renewal application if it finds: 

&#160;

&#183; 

that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. 

If as a result of an evidentiary hearing the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements for renewal and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, the FCC may deny a license renewal application. Historically, FCC licenses have generally been renewed. We have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed in the ordinary course, although there can be no assurance to that effect. The non-renewal of one or more of our stations&#8217; licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Ownership Matters . The Communications Act requires prior consent of the FCC for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license. In determining whether to approve an assignment of a television or radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the &#8220;character&#8221; of the licensee and those persons holding &#8220;attributable&#8221; interests therein, and the Communications Act&#8217;s limitations on foreign ownership and compliance with the FCC rules and regulations. 

To obtain the FCC&#8217;s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. If the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer or acquisition of more than 50% of the voting equity, the application must be placed on public notice for a period of 30 days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. If an assignment application does not involve new parties, or if a transfer of control application does not involve a &#8220;substantial&#8221; change in ownership or control, it is a pro forma application, which is not subject to the public notice and 30-day petition to deny procedure. The regular and pro forma applications are nevertheless subject to informal objections that may be filed any time until the FCC acts on the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, interested parties have 30 days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant. The FCC has an additional ten days to set aside such grant on its own motion. When ruling on an assignment or transfer application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application. 

Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not, absent a public interest determination by the FCC, be granted to or held by persons who are not U.S. citizens, by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives or by non-U.S. corporations. Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of its capital stock is owned of record or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, or foreign governments or their representatives or by non-U.S. corporations. The FCC has issued a declaratory order that it would, upon request, consider favorably permitting foreign ownership of broadcast stations in excess of the limits and has done so in at least one instance. It is presently considering the formalization and simplification of its internal processes in handling requests for consent to exceed the statutory limits. Thus, the licenses for our stations could be revoked if our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non-U.S. citizens in excess of these limitations. Our restated certificate of incorporation restricts the ownership and voting of our capital stock to comply with these requirements. 

The FCC generally applies its other broadcast ownership limits to &#8220;cognizable&#8221; interests held by an individual, corporation or other association or entity. In the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the stock of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests, as are positions as an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee. 

Stock interests held by insurance companies, mutual funds, bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of 20% or more of t he voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses. 

A time brokerage agreement with another television or radio station in the same market creates an attributable interest in the brokered television or radio station as well for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s local television or radio station ownership rules, if the agreement affects more than 15% of the brokered television or radio station&#8217;s weekly broadcast hours. Likewise, a joint sales agreement involving radio stations creates a similar attributable interest for the broadcast station that is undertaking the sales function. The FCC, acting in 2014, extended the joint sales agreement attribution policy to television stations and set an effective date of December 19, 2016; however, in late 2015, Congress, as part of the appropriations process, enacted legislation, which subsequently became law, that extended the effective date, for such agreements in effect as of March 31, 2014, which would have affected stations where we have such agreements, until September 30, 2025. We are considering whether to seek a waiver of this policy for our stations involved in joint sales agreements or to take other actions to comply with the new rules. 

Debt instruments, non-voting stock, options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised, insulated limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not &#8220;materially involved&#8221; in the media-related activities of the partnership and minority voting stock interests in corporations where there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock whose vote is sufficient to affirmatively direct the affairs of the corporation generally do not subject their holders to attribution. 

However, the FCC also applies a rule, known as the equity-debt-plus rule, which causes certain creditors or investors to be attributable owners of a station, regardless of whether there is a single majority stockholder or other applicable exception to the FCC&#8217;s attribution rules. Under this rule, a major programming supplier (any programming supplier that provides more than 15% of the station&#8217;s weekly programming hours) or a same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station&#8217;s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the equity-debt-plus rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and equity held by insulated limited partners in limited partnerships. Debt includes all liabilities, whether long-term or short-term. 

Under the ownership rules currently in place, the FCC generally permits an owner to have only one television station per market. A single owner is permitted to have two stations with overlapping signals so long as they are assigned to different markets. The FCC&#8217;s rules regarding ownership permit, however, an owner to operate two television stations assigned to the same market so long as either: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the television stations do not have overlapping broadcast signals; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

there will remain after the transaction eight independently owned, full power noncommercial or commercial operating television stations in the market and one of the two commonly-owned stations is not ranked in the top four based upon audience share. 

The FCC will consider waiving these ownership restrictions in certain cases involving failing or failed stations or stations which are not yet built. 

The FCC permits a television station owner to own one radio station in the same market as its television station. In addition, a television station owner is permitted to own additional radio stations, not to exceed the local radio ownership limits for the market, as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

in markets where 20 media voices will remain, a television station owner may own an additional five radio stations, or, if the owner only has one television station, an additional six radio stations; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

in markets where ten media voices will remain, a television station owner may own an additional three radio stations. 

A &#8220;media voice&#8221; includes each independently-owned and operated full-power television and radio station and each daily newspaper that has a circulation exceeding 5% of the households in the market, plus one voice for all cable television systems operating in the market. 

The FCC rules impose a limit on the number of television stations a single individual or entity may own nationwide. 

The number of radio stations an entity or individual may own in a radio market is as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to six commercial radio sta tions, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM). 

&#160;

&#183; 

In a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50% of the radio stations in such market. 

Because of these multiple and cross-ownership rules, if one of our stockholders, officers or directors holds a &#8220;cognizable&#8221; interest in our company, such stockholder, officer or director may violate the FCC&#8217;s rules if such person or entity also holds or acquires an attributable interest in other television or radio stations or daily newspapers in such markets, depending on their number and location. If an attributable stockholder, officer or director of our company violates any of these ownership rules, we may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct our broadcast business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 

Pursuant to the Communications Act, the FCC is required, on a quadrennial basis, to review its media ownership rules. The FCC began the most recent such review in 2010. In 2014, the FCC initiated a new Quadrennial Review and incorporated the existing 2010 record into that proceeding. 

The rule changes that have previously gone into effect amend the FCC&#8217;s methodology for defining a radio market for the purpose of ownership caps. The FCC replaced its signal contour method of defining local radio markets in favor of a geographic market assigned by Nielsen Audio, the private audience measurement service for radio broadcasters. For non- Nielsen Audio markets, the FCC is conducting a rulemaking in order to define markets in a manner comparable to Nielsen Audio&#8217;s method. In the interim, the FCC will apply a &#8220;modified contour approach,&#8221; to non- Nielsen Audio markets. This modified approach will exclude any radio station whose transmitter site is more than 58 miles from the perimeter of the mutual overlap area. As for newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership, the FCC adopted a presumption that newspaper-broadcast ownership is consistent with the public interest in the top 20 television markets, while the presumption, in smaller markets, is that such cross-ownership is not consistent with the public interest, subject to certain exceptions. 

With regard to the national television ownership limit, the FCC increased the national television ownership limit to 45% from 35%. Congress subsequently enacted legislation that reduced the nationwide cap to 39%. Accordingly, a company can now own television stations collectively reaching up to a 39% share of U.S. television households. Limits on ownership of multiple local television stations still apply, even if the 39% limit is not reached on a national level. 

In establishing a national cap by statute, Congress did not make mention of the FCC&#8217;s UHF discount policy, whereby UHF stations are deemed to serve only one-half of the population in their television markets. The FCC has commenced a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether it should retain the UHF discount policy. In doing so, the FCC has stated that it will grandfather ownership interests in place as of the commencement of the proceeding.

The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a broadcast station&#8217;s community of license. Nevertheless, a broadcast licensee continues to be required to present programming in response to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from the public about a broadcast station&#8217;s programming when it evaluates the licensee&#8217;s renewal application, but complaints also may be filed and considered at any time. Stations also must follow various FCC rules that regulate, among other things, political broadcasting, the broadcast of profane, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operations. 

The FCC requires that licensees must not discriminate in hiring practices. It has recently released new rules that will require us to adhere to certain outreach practices when hiring personnel for our stations and to keep records of our compliance with these requirements. On March 10, 2003, the FCC&#8217;s current Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO, rules went into effect. The rules set forth a three-pronged recruitment and outreach program for companies with five or more full-time employees that requires the wide dissemination of information regarding full-time vacancies, notification to requesting recruitment organizations of such vacancies, and a number of non-vacancy related outreach efforts such as job fairs and internships. Stations are required to collect various information concerning vacancies, such as the number filled, recruitment sources used to fill each vacancy, and the number of persons interviewed for each vacancy. While stations are not required to routinely submit information to the FCC, stations must place an EEO report containing vacancy-related information and a description of outreach efforts in their public file annually. Stations must submit the annual EEO public file report as part of their renewal applications, and television stations with five or more full-time employees and radio stations with more than ten employees also must submit the report midway through their license term for FCC review. Stations also must place their EEO public file report on their Internet websites, if they have one. The EEO rules do not materially affect our operations. Failure to comply with the FCC&#8217;s EEO rules could result in sanctions or the revocation of station licenses. 

The FCC rules also prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, provided that the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner. 

&#8220;Retransmission Consent&#8221; and &#8220;Must Carry&#8221; Rules . FCC regulations implementing the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, or the Cable Act, require each full-power television broadcaster to elect, at three-year intervals beginning October 1, 1993, to either: 

&#160;

&#183; 

require carriage of its signal by cable systems in the station&#8217;s market, which is referred to as &#8220;must carry&#8221; rules; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

negotiate the terms on which such broadcast station would permit transmission of its signal by the cable systems within its market which is referred to as &#8220;retransmission consent.&#8221; 

For the three-year period commencing on January 1, 2015, we generally elected &#8220;retransmission consent&#8221; in notifying the MVPDs that carry our television programming in our television markets. We have arrangements or have entered into agreements with nearly all of our MVPDs as to the terms of the carriage of our television stations and the compensation we will receive for granting such carriage rights, including through our national program supplier for Spanish-language programming, Univision, for our Univision- and UniM&#225;s-affiliated television stations, for the three-year period. The FCC has adopted a rule that now prohibits any future combined retransmission consent negotiations by television stations in the same television market that are not commonly-controlled. This rule prohibits us and Univision from negotiating retransmission consent jointly, or from coordinating such negotiations, in six markets where both companies own television stations.

The FCC has rules that govern the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements based on a policy decision to have those agreements negotiated in good faith. The FCC is undertaking a proceeding that could result in establishing new ground rules for such negotiations, including prohibiting certain negotiating practices on the part of broadcasters. We are not certain whether or in what form such provisions might be adopted and the impact of such changes on our negotiations and the economic results of such negotiations. Under the FCC&#8217;s rules currently in effect, cable systems are only required to carry one signal from each local broadcast television station. As an element of the retransmission consent negotiations described above, we arranged that our broadcast signal be available to our MVPD viewers, no matter whether they obtain their cable service in analog or digital modes. Cable systems are rapidly transitioning to providing their services in digital and we expect that analog cable service will be terminated by most cable operators and in most markets. 

We continue to explore, subject to our legal rights to do so, and the economic opportunities available to us, the distribution of our programming in alternative modes, such as by delivery on the Internet, by multicast delivery services, and to individuals possessing wireless mobile reception devices. 

Time Brokerage, Joint Sales Agreements and Shared Services Agreements . We have, from time to time, entered into time brokerage, joint sales and shared services agreements, generally in connection with pending station acquisitions, under which we are given the right to broker time on stations owned by third parties, agree that other parties may broker time on our stations, we or other parties sell broadcast time on a station, or share operating services with another broadcast station in the same market, as the case may be. By using these agreements, we can provide programming and other services to a station proposed to be acquired before we receive all applicable FCC and other governmental approvals, or receive such programming and other services where a third party is better able to undertake programming and/or sales efforts for us. 

FCC rules and policies generally permit time brokerage agreements if the station licensee retains ultimate responsibility for and control of the applicable station. We cannot be sure that we will be able to air all of our scheduled programming on a station with which we have time brokerage agreements or that we will receive the anticipated revenue from the sale of advertising for such programming. 

Under a typical joint sales agreement, a station licensee obtains, for a fee, the right to sell substantially all of the commercial advertising on a separately owned and licensed station in the same market. It also involves the provision by the selling party of certain sales, accounting and services to the station whose advertising is being sold. Unlike a time brokerage agreement, the typical joint sales agreement does not involve operating the station&#8217;s program format. 

In a shared services agreement, one station provides services, generally of a non-programming nature, to another station in the same market. This enables the recipient of the services to save on overhead costs. 

As part of its increased scrutiny of television and radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that time brokerage agreements and joint sales agreements could violate the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSRA, if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSRA. Furthermore, the DOJ has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and has 

challenged them in certain locations. The DOJ also has sta ted publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to television and radio station acquisitions, above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

Digital Television Services . The FCC has adopted rules for implementing digital television service in the United States. Implementation of digital television has improved the technical quality of television signals and provides broadcasters the flexibility to offer new services, including high-definition television and broadband data transmission. The digital transition for full-power television stations was completed on June 12, 2009. 

The FCC has required full-power and Class A television stations in the United States to operate in digital television. The transition date for low-power television stations has been postponed until after the completion of the incentive auction process (as hereinafter discussed). We have timely completed the digital transition of all of our full-power and Class A television stations to the digital mode. We are in the process of transitioning certain of our low-power stations to the digital mode where we believe is in our best interest to do so. We will make additional decisions after the completion of the incentive auction and repacking, as we determine the availability of spectrum to accommodate our low-power television stations. 

The FCC has adopted rules to permit low-power stations to operate on a paired or stand-alone basis in digital service. We have secured authority for certain of our low-power stations to have paired operations or operate in digital. In certain cases, we have requested authority to &#8220;flash cut&#8221; certain of our low-power stations to digital service. In those markets where no spectrum was available for paired operations, we will make a decision to switch individual stations from analog to digital service based on the viewing patterns of our viewers. 

Equipment and other costs associated with the transition to digital television, including the necessity of temporary dual-mode operations and the relocation of stations from one channel to another, have imposed some near-term financial costs on our television stations providing the services. The potential also exists for new sources of revenue to be derived from use of the digital spectrum, which we have explored in certain of our markets. 

Digital Radio Services . The FCC has adopted standards for authorizing and implementing terrestrial digital audio broadcasting technology, known as &#8220;In-Band On-Channel&#8482;&#8221; or HD Radio, for radio stations. Digital audio broadcasting&#8217;s advantages over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services. This technology permits FM and AM stations to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats, or in digital only formats, using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use. We have elected and commenced the process of rolling out this technology on a gradual basis owing to the absence of receivers equipped to receive such signals and are considering its merits as well as its costs. It is unclear what effect such technology will have on our business or the operations of our radio stations. 

Radio Frequency Radiation . The FCC has adopted rules limiting human exposure to levels of radio frequency radiation. These rules require applicants for renewal of broadcast licenses or modification of existing licenses to inform the FCC whether an applicant&#8217;s broadcast facility would expose people to excessive radio frequency radiation. We currently believe that all of our stations are in compliance with the FCC&#8217;s current rules regarding radio frequency radiation exposure. 

Low-Power Radio Broadcast Service . The FCC has created a low-power FM radio service and has granted a limited number of construction permits for such stations. Pursuant to legislation adopted in 2011, this service is being expanded and the opportunities for FM translator stations reduced. The low-power FM service allows for the operation of low-power FM radio stations, with a maximum power level of 100 watts. The 100-watt stations reach an area with a radius of approximately three and one-half miles. The low-power FM stations are required to protect other existing FM stations, as currently required of full-powered FM stations. 

The low-power FM service is exclusively non-commercial. To date, our stations have not suffered any technical interference from such low-power FM stations&#8217; signals. Due to current technical restrictions and the non-commercial ownership requirement for low-power FM stations, we have not found that low-power FM service has caused any detrimental economic impact on our stations as well. Federal legislation has resulted in the increase in the availability of the low-power FM service and the FCC has recently begun granting new low-power FM authorizations. We do not foresee any material impact on our stations as a result of this legislation. 

Other Proceedings . The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, or SHVIA, allows satellite carriers to deliver broadcast programming to subscribers who are unable to obtain television network programming over the air from local television stations. Congress in 1999 enacted legislation to amend the SHVIA to facilitate the ability of satellite carriers to provide subscribers with programming from local television stations. Any satellite company that has chosen to provide local-into-local service must provide subscribers with all of the local broadcast television signals that are assigned to the market and where television licensees ask to be carried on the satellite system. We have taken advantage of this law to secure carriage of our full-power stations in those markets where the satellite operators have implemented local-into-local service. SHVIA expired in 2004 and Congress adopted the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, or SHVERA. SHVERA extended the ability of satellite operators to implement local-into-local service. SHVERA expired in late 2009, but was extended in May 2010 by the Satellite Television 

Extension and Localism Act , or STELA. STELA provided a further five-year extension of the &#8220;carry one/carry all&#8221; rule earlier adopted in SHVIA and SHVERA and was further renewed in late 2014 under the terms of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (STELAR) . To the extent we have dec ided to secure our carriage on DBS through retransmission consent agreements, the &#8220;carry one/carry all&#8221; rule is no longer relevant to us. 

White Spaces. The FCC has adopted rules, that are under appeal by the National Association of Broadcasters and other parties, to allow unlicensed users to operate within the broadcast spectrum in unoccupied parts known as the &#8220;white spaces.&#8221; The intention of the rules was to make available unused spectrum for use in connection with wireless functions related to connectivity between computers and related devices and the Internet. The FCC believes that the provisions it adopted will protect broadcast services. Broadcast groups, on the other hand, believe that operation of unlicensed devices in the &#8220;white spaces&#8221; has the potential for causing interference to broadcast reception. It is premature to judge the potential impact of what services, if any, operate under the FCC&#8217;s rules on over-the-air broadcasting. 

Performance Tax. While radio broadcasters have long paid license fees to composers for the musical works they have written, radio broadcasters have never compensated musical artists for their recordings of these works. The rationale was that the radio broadcasting industry provided artists, free of charge, with a promotional service for their performance. 

As the entire music industry has changed, with revenues from the sale of CDs continuing to drop dramatically, both musical artists and the recording companies have sought a change in how business is done. The recording companies, with the backing of many artists, have asked Congress to require that broadcasters pay fees for the broadcast exploitation of musical works. Such legislation received favorable committee action in Congress during 2009 and 2010, but no legislation was then enacted. Congress has not taken any subsequent actions, but the issue remains under consideration. Were such legislation to be adopted, its impact would depend on how any fees were structured. 

Spectrum Policies/Incentive Auction. After studying national broadband needs, the FCC made a determination that a critical need exists to expand the spectrum available for wireless broadband services. This need is perceived to arise based on a finding that consumers and businesses will have an increasing usage of wireless devices and the associated spectrum for telephony, data transmission, and entertainment purposes. The FCC has further determined that in order to avert a spectrum crisis, it must recover and reallocate to wireless broadband a total of 500 MHz of spectrum, of which up to 120 MHz (amounting to 20 channels) are expected to come from spectrum currently allocated to television broadcasting. 

In order to achieve this spectrum recovery, legislation has been enacted and the FCC established a mechanism for broadcasters to participate in a &#8220;voluntary incentive auction&#8221; in which interested station owners offer the spectrum of their stations in a &#8220;reverse auction&#8221;, providing spectrum for wireless operators to purchase in a simultaneous or future &#8220;forward auction&#8221;. Through a series of rulemaking proceedings, the FCC has established how stations will be valued, what percentage of the auction payments will go to broadcasters, and what rights, if any, will selling stations or stations agreeing to share spectrum retain following the completion of the sale of their stations and associated spectrum. Likewise, following the completion of the auction process, the FCC intends to repack the television band and this repacking may have an impact on our full-service and Class A stations as such stations may have to be relocated, and the levels of interference protection and other regulatory provisions may be altered to accommodate the reduction in available broadcast channels. The FCC has been authorized to use certain of the proceeds derived from the auction to reimburse broadcasters for certain costs associated with such repacking.

The reverse auction is now scheduled to commence on March 29, 2016. We have filed applications to participate in the reverse auction to monetize a portion of our spectrum assets. We will not know the results of the auction until the entire auction process is completed, and we will not be able to publicly communicate the preliminary results of our participation in the auction until the auction is completed, which may not be before the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Any reduction in available spectrum arising from the post-auction repacking process may have a detrimental impact on low-power stations (other than Class A stations), including the loss of those in television markets where there will no longer be available spectrum to accommodate them.

Regulation of Digital Advertising

We are subject to many United States federal and state laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, applicable to businesses engaged in providing digital media advertising services. These laws potentially can affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices, increase our cost of compliance or impose a greater risk of liability, and these laws continue to evolve.

Compliance with privacy, data protection and data security laws plays a significant role in our business. In the United States, both federal and state laws regulate activities inherent to digital advertising, including the collection and use of consumer data by us and by companies with which we do business in the course of providing digital media services. We also rely on the services of third 

parties in gathering, using and storing consumer data, and these parties &#8217; compliance with applicable laws affects our own compliance status. Because we interact with consumers outside the United States and provide services to advertisers who themselves interact with those consumers, the laws of other jurisdictions may also app ly to the types of services we provide. Privacy and data protection regulations have gained substantial publicity and attention in light of growing consumer expectations both for enhanced services as well as privacy, especially in light of publicized data breach incidents. 

Online advertising activities in the United States primarily have been subject to regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which principally relies on its enforcement authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to investigate and respond to unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool used to respond to claims of deceptive or inadequate privacy policies, inadequate data security practices and misuse of consumer data. The FTC&#8217;s enforcement focus has included close attention to the mobile advertising industry. For example, in December 2012, the FTC adopted amendments to rules under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which went into effect in July 2013. These amendments broaden the potential applicability of COPPA compliance obligations to our activities and those of our clients when interacting with children. California&#8217;s parallel children&#8217;s privacy law also has been expanded and potentially reaches consumers not covered by COPPA. By way of further example, the FTC&#8217;s testimonial and endorsement guidelines were updated in late 2009 and provided additional and expanded guidance for advertising practices using endorsements, testimonials and similar content. In addition to formal rules and guidelines, the FTC&#8217;s active enforcement in the digital media industry creates evolving precedent for challenging digital advertising practices as deceptive or unfair.

The FTC has devoted particular attention to businesses within the digital media channel where the FTC has determined that potentially abusive practices have occurred or are likely to occur. The FTC focuses its enforcement resources on the accuracy of consumer disclosures, data practices transparency and data aggregation. More recently, the FTC has communicated its intention to focus on the use of data to disadvantage vulnerable or minority communities, and particular attention has been paid to data brokers and aggregators of the type that may assist us in creating consumer profiles and in serving advertisements. In some circumstances, the FTC has taken the position that advertisers may be liable for the acts of channel partners and has successfully brought enforcement actions against parties based on the activities of their channel partners. This creates the possibility of enforcement risk for acts other than our own.

The FTC also has employed its Section 5 authority to take action against digital advertising businesses with regard to their data security practices and policies, even apart from its traditional enforcement of privacy regulations and standards.

State attorneys general also enforce consumer protection laws, some modeled after the Federal Trade Commission Act, in ways that affect the digital advertising industry. In addition, several states mandate specific data security measures, and 47 states and the District of Columbia enforce data breach notification laws that require notification to consumers and, in some instances, law enforcement, in the event of a covered data security incident.

In other markets we serve, the regulation of consumer practices in digital advertising is less mature. In Mexico, for example, the regulation of digital advertising largely relies on applying regulatory constraints on traditional print advertising (such as prohibitions on pornographic or politically inflammatory speech) to digital advertising.

The issue of privacy in the digital media industry is still evolving. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, have considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants&#8217; ability to collect, retain, augment, analyze, use and share consumer data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ &#8220;cookies&#8221; or other electronic tools to track online activities. Enforcement bodies are developing rules and enforcement standards applicable to the collection, storage and use of geolocation data, transparency of consumer data profile creation and management, and consumer access to and control over their individual online profiles and the collection of consumer data through &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; technology. The privacy and data security laws of Mexico, though still evolving, present a particular compliance obligation given our relationship with Mexican consumers. Mexican law mandates the application of adequate data security measures and the consent of individuals before processing their personal information.

The European Union, or EU, and its member states currently regulate digital advertising practices pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC (commonly known as the &#8220;Data Protection Directive&#8221;) and implementing national legislation. The EU is nearing completion of a comprehensive EU-wide General Data Protection regulation that will replace the current Data Protection Directive that, among other things, will govern digital advertising practices in the EU. Current and developing EU law, among other things, requires advertisers to obtain specific types of explicit notice to and consent from individuals before using cookies or other technologies to track individuals and their online behavior and deliver targeted advertisements, increases monetary penalties for non-compliance, extends the extraterritorial reach of EU data protection laws, and grants consumers the rights in some circumstances to require that their data no longer be stored or processed. It remains a possibility that additional legislation may be passed and regulations or otherwise issued in the future. Other jurisdictions similarly continue to develop enhanced data protection and security laws.

The regulation of cros s-border data transfers is in a state of heightened uncertainty, with the EU having invalidated the principal means of transferring the personal data of European nationals to certain jurisdictions, particularly the Unites States, and the ongoing inter-gove rnmental consultations on new transfer mechanisms . 

We also participate in industry self-regulatory programs under which, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising and allow them to opt-out from the use of data we collect for the delivery of targeted advertising. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs in which we participate are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.

Additionally, in the United States and, increasingly, in other jurisdictions, consumers are provided private rights of action to file civil lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, against companies that conduct business in the digital media industry, including makers of devices that display digital media, providers of digital media, operating system providers and third party networks. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits have alleged a range of violations of federal, state and common law, including computer trespass and violation of privacy laws. Recent appellate decisions have affirmed the standing of consumers to initiate class and mass action litigation to remedy breaches of their privacy rights and injuries resulting from data breaches.

Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or applicable international laws or regulations pertaining to privacy or data protection, or other policies, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, and also could result in reputational injury and/or monetary fines.
