 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Payment Data Systems, Inc. was founded in July 1998 and incorporated in the State of Nevada. We are an integrated payment solutions provider offering a range of customized services to merchants, billers, banks, service bureaus, and card issuers. We operate solely in the U.S. through our two operating entities, Payment Data Systems, Inc. and FiCentive, Inc., our primary business is processing electronic payments for other companies including all types of Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) processing, credit, prepaid card and debit card-based processing. In our 17-year history, we have created a loyal customer base that rely on us for our convenient, secure, innovative and adaptive services and technology, and we have built long-standing and valuable relationships with premier banking institutions such as Fifth-Third Bank, Sunrise Bank, and Wells Fargo. 

&#160;

Payment Data Systems, Inc. We provide integrated electronic payment processing services to merchants and businesses, including credit and debit card-based processing services and transaction processing via the ACH network. The ACH network is a nationwide electronic funds transfer system that is regulated by the Federal Reserve and NACHA, the electronic payments association, and provides for the clearing of electronic payments between participating financial institutions. Our ACH processing services enable merchants or businesses to both disburse and collect funds electronically using e-checks to transfer funds instead of traditional paper checks. An e-check is an electronic debit to a bank checking account that is initiated at the point-of-sale, on the Internet, over the telephone, or via a bill payment sent through the mail, and e-checks are processed using the ACH network.

&#160;

Our card-based processing services enable merchants to process both traditional card-present, or "swipe," transactions, as well as card-not-present transactions. A traditional card-present transaction occurs whenever a cardholder physically presents a credit or debit card to a merchant at the point-of-sale. A card-not-present transaction occurs whenever the customer does not physically present a payment card at the point-of-sale and may occur over the Internet, mail, fax or telephone.

&#160;

Our electronic payment processing may take place in a variety of forms and situations. For example, our capabilities allow merchants to convert a paper check to an e-check or receive card authorization at the point-of-sale, allow our merchants&#8217; respective customer service representatives to take e-check or card payments from their consumers by telephone, and enable their consumers to make e-check or card payments directly through the use of a web site or by calling an interactive voice response telephone system. In addition, we operate an online payment processing service, under the domain name www.billx.com system, which allows consumers to process online payments to pay any other individual, including family and friends.

&#160;

FiCentive, Inc. We also provide prepaid card processing services for merchants and consumers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, FiCentive, Inc. We offer MasterCard prepaid cards branded with our customers&#8217; corporation logos or trademarks. These prepaid cards can be used for various applications including payroll, corporate incentives, employee incentives, and general use. Some card programs allow the cards to be reloaded with funds, while others do not have that capability. In some cases, the cards can be used at Automatic Teller Machines, or ATMs, to withdraw cash.

&#160;

Through acquiring the assets of Akimbo Financial, Inc., in December 2014, we also added a highly talented technical staff of industry subject matter experts and an innovative cardholder service platform with new and significant prepaid card front-end technology including mobile applications. We offer prepaid cards directly to consumers for use as a tool to stay on budget, manage allowances and share money with family and friends, and businesses use the Akimbo platform to deliver a wide variety of payments from rewards and incentives to regular payroll. We have moved the Akimbo card program to operate on the MasterCard and associated networks and to our existing sponsoring bank, Sunrise Banks, N.A. The Akimbo MasterCard program became live on our processing platform in early April 2015. The Akimbo Visa card program was decommissioned of all services on May 30, 2015 and the card customers were transitioned to the Akimbo MasterCard card program. Since then we have further developed our Akimbo platform to include Akimbo Now for businesses, Akimbo Gift for consumers and support for Apple Pay&#8482;.

&#160;

Industry Background 

&#160;

In the United States, the use of non-paper based forms of payment, such as credit and debit cards, has risen steadily over the past several years. According to a 2013 Federal Reserve Payments study, the estimated number of non-cash payments increased 4.2% per year from 2009 to 2012, and totaled $122.8 billion in 2012. From 2009 to 2012, ACH, debit cards and prepaid cards grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4%, 7.7% and 15.9%, respectively, while credit card transactions grew at an annual rate of 7.6%, and use of paper checks declined by 9.2%. Electronic payments, including payments made with cards and ACH, collectively represent 85% of all non-cash payments. Banking and financial institutions enable their account holders to use more check image deposit services which is also referred to as &#8220;remote deposit capture.&#8221; As a result, traditional paper trails are being replaced by speedier, more cost-effective and eco-friendly image exchanges.

&#160;

The growth of electronic commerce has made the acceptance of card-based and other electronic forms of payment a necessity for businesses, both large and small, in order to remain competitive. We believe that the electronic payment processing industry will continue to benefit from the following trends:

&#160;

Favorable Demographics

&#160;

As consumers age, we expect that they will continue to use the payment technology to which they have grown accustomed. More consumers are beginning to use card-based and other electronic payment methods for purchases at an earlier age. These consumers have witnessed the wide adoption of card products, technology innovations such as mobile phone payment applications, and widespread adoption of the Internet. They comprise an increasing percentage of the population and as they enter the work force, we expect purchases using electronic payment methods will become a larger percentage of total consumer spending. We believe the increasing usage of smartphones as an instrument of payment will also create further opportunities for us in the future. We also believe that contactless payments like Apple Pay&#8482; will increase payment processing opportunities for us.

&#160;

Increased Electronic Payment Acceptance by Small Businesses 

&#160;

Small businesses are a vital component of the U.S. economy and are expected to contribute to the increased use of electronic payment methods. The lower costs associated with electronic payment methods are making these services more affordable to a larger segment of the small business market. In addition, we believe these businesses are experiencing increased pressure to accept electronic payment methods in order to remain competitive and to meet consumer expectations. As a result, many of these small businesses are seeking to provide customers with the ability to pay for merchandise and services using electronic payment methods, including those in industries that have historically accepted cash and checks as the only forms of payment for their merchandise and services.

&#160;

Growth in Online Transactions 

&#160;

Market researchers expect continued growth in card-not-present transactions due to the steady growth of the Internet and electronic commerce. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated retail e-commerce sales for 2014 were $304.9 billion, an increase of approximately 15.4% from $263.3 billion in 2013.

&#160;

Forrester Research expects that e-commerce sales in the United States will keep growing at a 9.5% compound annual growth rate through 2018, translating to online retail sales of $414 billion in 2018, up from $263 billion in 2013. Companies, both large and small, continue to leverage the Internet in order to remain competitive, improve operational efficiencies, create new revenue streams and maximize the longevity and profitability of their customer relationships.

&#160;

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160;

All of our service offerings are supported by our systems&#8217; infrastructure that integrates certain proprietary components with processing systems outsourced to third-party providers to offer our customers a flexible and secure payment process. We utilize a secure sockets layer architecture so that connections and information are secure from outside inspection. We also use 128-bit encryption for all electronic transactions that we process to make information unreadable as it passes over the Internet. Our systems&#8217; infrastructure allows us to work with our customers to build a customized electronic payment service offering tailored to their specific needs. We have designed and implemented our integrated payment systems to function as gateways between our customers and our third-party processing providers. Our systems provide for interfaces with our customers through which payment data is captured electronically and transferred through the connections we have with our processing providers. Our systems also provide a data warehousing capability so that all of payment data related to a customer can be stored in one place to facilitate efficient data retrieval and analysis. All confidential data stored within and outside the data warehouse is fully encrypted. We outsource our ACH transaction processing and card-based transaction processing to third-party providers. Our card-based processing system is capable of connecting with all of the major card-based processors in the United States.

&#160;

Payment Processing. The components of our service offerings include all forms of ACH transaction processing, such as Represented Check, which is a consumer non-sufficient funds check that is presented for payment electronically rather than through the paper check collection system, and Accounts Receivable Check Conversion, which is a consumer paper check payment that is converted into an e-check. Our customers can initiate ACH transactions directly using an online terminal accessible through a website or we can initiate ACH transactions on their behalf. Our service offering also includes merchant account services for the processing of card-based transactions through the VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB networks, including online terminal services accessed through a web site or retail services accessed via a physical terminal. We offer a proprietary web-based customer service application that combines both ACH and card processing capabilities that allows companies to process one-time and recurring payments via e-checks or credit cards at the request of their consumers. In addition, we offer an Interactive Voice Response telephone system to companies that accept payments directly from consumers over the telephone using e-checks or credit cards.

&#160;

In October 2015, we introduced our new e-check verification technology, which helps merchants prevent returns before processing and reduces return check transactions . This new service utilizes our proprietary returns database that contains records for any transaction that we had previously attempted to process and the transaction was unsuccessful for account closed, invalid account, non-sufficient funds, payment stopped, frozen account, unauthorized account, and others. Merchants are allowed to query this database in advance of submitting a transaction for processing and settlement. Merchants utilize this data to make their own determination if they wish to process a payment or not. We charge a transaction fee for each query and for each account that a query returns data. 

&#160;

We also operate a consumer web site focused on providing bill payment services under the domain name www.billx.com, and manage all of the related back-end processing through our own proprietary processing engine. Consumers subscribe to the payment service and are allowed to make a certain number of payments each month for a flat monthly fee and are assessed a separate fee for any additional payments made over the limit. Our online payment processing service seeks to provide consumers with an efficient and secure interface for paying and managing bills via the Internet. We also sell this payment portal service as a private label solution to online financial services providers looking to provide online bill payment capabilities as part of their service offering to consumers. We also offer this service to other debit card issuers, as we are able to utilize the bill payment component of this service for payments made via debit cards, a patented process for which we own a perpetual license.

&#160;

Prepaid and Incentive Cards. In addition to these electronic payment services, we are a prepaid card program manager and prepaid card processor. We develop and manage prepaid card programs on behalf of corporate clients who have customers that want prepaid cards that are branded with the entity&#8217;s unique logo. We started issuing cards in October 2011 and hold bank sponsorship agreements with Sunrise Banks, N.A., formerly known as University National Bank, and Metropolitan Commercial Bank for our prepaid card program. We also have the ability to issue Discover, American Express, Visa, and MasterCard prepaid cards. We primarily create, manage and process prepaid card programs for corporate clients, tailored to each client&#8217;s unique objectives to allow the client to issue prepaid cards to their customer base or employees as an incentive in the form of a rebate, commission, or other incentive. We also issue general purpose reloadable cards to consumers as an alternative to a traditional bank account under the Akimbo and Stream card brands. We believe our prepaid card product offering is competitive due to our proprietary systems and the ability to implement corporate-branded card programs in a shorter time frame than most of our competitors. We also believe our more than 9 years of experience in processing and managing prepaid card programs is a competitive advantage over many of our competitors due to the industry being relatively new. Also, there is a significant barrier in obtaining bank sponsorship to prepaid card program management and even a higher barrier to performing prepaid card processing.

&#160;

&#160;

Relationships with Sponsors and Processors 

&#160;

We have agreements with several processors that provide to us, on a non-exclusive basis, transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. In order to provide payment processing services for ACH transactions, we must maintain a relationship with an Originating Depository Financial Institution, or ODFI, in the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, network because we are not a bank and therefore we are not eligible to be an Originating Depository Financial Institution. For the ODFI portion of our ACH business, we have entered into agreements with the Fifth Third Bank and Generations Federal Credit Union. We are financially liable for all fees, fines, chargebacks and losses related to our ACH processing merchant customers. We may also require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate any such risk. Similarly, in order to provide payment-processing services for Visa, MasterCard and Discover transactions, we must be sponsored by a financial institution that is a principal member of the respective Visa, MasterCard and Discover card associations. Merrick Bank and Wells Fargo Bank have, respectively, sponsored us under the designations Third Party Processor, or TPP, and Independent Sales Organization, or ISO with the Visa card association, and under the designations Third Party Servicer, or TPS, and Merchant Service Provider, or MSP, with the MasterCard card association. We have an agreement with TriSource Solutions, LLC and an agreement with Global Payments, Inc. through which their member banks, Merrick Bank and Wells Fargo, sponsor us for membership in the Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover card associations and settle card transactions for our merchants. These agreements may be terminated by the processor if we materially breach the agreements and we do not cure the breach within 30 days, or if we enter bankruptcy or file for bankruptcy. We also maintain a bank sponsorship agreement with Sunrise Banks, N.A., formerly known as University National Bank, and Metropolitan Commercial Bank for our prepaid card programs. We are liable for any card-associated losses for cards that we issue that might incur a negative balance and we are liable for card association fines, fees and chargebacks.

&#160;

Under our processing agreement with TriSource Solutions, we are financially liable for all fees, fines, chargebacks and losses related to our card processing merchant customers. Under our processing agreement with Global Payments, Inc., we are not financially liable for all fees, chargebacks and losses related to our card processing merchant customers, but we are liable for potential card association fines. If, due to insolvency or bankruptcy of our merchant customers, or for another reason, we are unable to collect from our merchant customers amounts that have been refunded to the cardholders because the cardholders properly initiated a chargeback transaction to reverse the credit card charges, we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the cardholder transaction. We utilize a number of systems and procedures to evaluate and manage merchant risk, such as obtaining approval of prospective merchants from our processor and sponsor bank, setting transaction limits and monitoring account activity. We may also require cash deposits and other types of collateral from certain merchants to mitigate any such risk. We maintain a reserve for losses resulting from card processing and related chargebacks. We estimate our potential loss for chargebacks by performing a historical analysis of our chargeback loss experience with similar merchants and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future, such as the types of card transactions processed and nature of the merchant relationship with their consumers.

&#160;

We maintain a separate allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our merchant customers to make required payments for fees charged by us. Amounts due from customers may be deemed uncollectible because of merchant disputes, fraud, insolvency or bankruptcy. We determine the allowance based on an account-by-account review, taking into consideration such factors as the age of the outstanding receivable, historical pattern of collections and financial condition of the customer. We closely monitor extensions of credit and if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make contractual payments, additional allowances may be required.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We market and sell our products and services primarily through non-exclusive resellers that act as an external sales force, with minimal direct investment in sales infrastructure and management, as well as direct contact by our sales personnel. Our direct sales efforts are coordinated by a sales executive and supported by other employees who function in sales capacities. Our primary market focus is on companies generating high volumes of electronic payment transactions. We tailor our sales efforts to reach this market by pre-qualifying prospective sales leads through direct contact or market research. Our sales personnel typically initiate contact with prospective customers that we identify as meeting our target customer profile. We also market and sell our prepaid card program directly to corporations and to consumers through the Internet. We intend to continue to analyze our sales and marketing efforts in order to control costs, increase the effectiveness of our sales force, and broaden our reach through reseller initiatives and advantageous alliances.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

Our primary customers are merchants and businesses that use our Automated Clearing House and/or card-based processing services in order to provide their consumers with the ability to pay for goods and services without having to use cash or a paper check. These merchant customers operate in a variety of retail industries and are under contract with us to exclusively use the services that we provide to them. Most of our merchant customers have signed long-term contracts, generally with three-year terms, that provide for volume-based transaction fees. Our merchant accounts decreased to 768 customers at December 31, 2015 from 795 customers at December 31, 2014.

&#160;

No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues in 2015. We had one customer that accounted for 11% of our 2014 revenue who was a customer of our ACH Processing services. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues in 2014.

&#160;

All of our customers, including those utilizing our billx.com Internet bill payment service on a recurring monthly basis to pay household bills, are consumers geographically dispersed throughout the United States. The service relationship between our billx.com customers and us is not contractual and the fee we charge for the service is not negotiable. We seek to retain customers by providing high levels of customer service. Customers also have incentive to continue using the service once activated due to their investment of time in setting up the service with their personal banking and payment information. The monthly average number of billx.com customers using our online payment service decreased to 197 in 2015 from 244 in 2014. We believe the decrease occurred due to customers opting to use their bank bill pay service over ours.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The payment processing industry is highly competitive. Many small and large companies compete with us in providing payment processing services and related services to a wide range of merchants. There are a number of large transaction processors, including First Data Merchant Services Corporation, Elavon Inc., and Vantiv, Inc. that serve a broad market spectrum from large to small merchants and provide banking, automatic teller machine, and other payment-related services and systems in addition to card-based payment processing. There are also a large number of smaller transaction processors that provide various services to small and medium-sized merchants. Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than us and operate as subsidiaries of financial or bank holding companies, which may allow them on a consolidated basis to own and conduct depository and other banking activities that we do not have the regulatory authority to own or conduct. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:

&#160;

&#183; quality of service; 

&#183; reliability of service; 

&#183; ability to evaluate, undertake and manage risk; 

&#183; ability to offer customized technology solutions; 

&#183; speed in implementing payment processes; 

&#183; price and other financial terms; and 

&#183; multi-channel payment capability. &#160;

We believe that our specific focus on providing integrated payment processing solutions to merchants, in addition to our understanding of the needs and risks associated with providing payment processing services electronically, gives us a competitive advantage over other competitors, which have a narrower market perspective, and over competitors of a similar or smaller size that may lack our experience in the electronic payments industry. Furthermore, we believe we present a competitive distinction through the use of our internal technology to provide a single integrated payment storage or warehouse that consolidates, processes, tracks and reports all payments regardless of payment source or channel. We also believe our customized technology solutions and high level of service gives us a competitive advantage, particularly for smaller business that does not have large internal technology capabilities or the ability to comply with payment security regulations.

&#160;

Our prepaid card offering is competitive due to our proprietary systems and our ability to create and establish corporate-branded card programs in a shorter time frame than most of our competitors. We also believe more than nine years of experience in processing and managing prepaid card programs is a competitive advantage over many of our competitors due to the industry being relatively new. We also believe that the mobile application technology and advanced card holder websites we acquired through the Akimbo acquisition will provide us a competitive advantage in securing both consumer customers and business clients that have a need for a card program for their customer base. We also believe we hold a significant competitive advantage over potential entrants into the prepaid industry since there is a significant barrier in obtaining bank sponsorship to prepaid card program management and even a higher barrier to performing prepaid card processing.

&#160;

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our services and related products.

&#160;

Patents 

&#160;

On January 11, 2008, we executed an agreement to sell selected patents and patent applications, including U.S. Patent No. 7,021,530, to PCT Software Data, LLC for net proceeds of approximately $750,000. The patents and patent applications sold relate to bill payments made with debit and stored value cards. We retained a worldwide, non-exclusive license under the patents for use with all current and future customers.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our industry is highly regulated. Any new or changes made to U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations, card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines. Certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and MasterCard.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160;

In the United States, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act caused significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates the fees charged or received by issuers for processing debit transactions and the transaction routing options available to merchants. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate consumer financial services, including many offered by our customers. Additionally, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. In addition, the Durbin Amendment contains prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act, when implemented in September 2011, caused interchange fees to be lowered on large bank-issued debit cards. The lowered interchange fees had a mild negative impact on our revenues, but increased our earnings due to the fact that we were able to keep our prices constant with our merchants. If our competitors start to pass the extra margin into savings to their merchants, we may be forced to follow their actions and become exposed to lower earnings on the debit card transactions for large banks. Our prepaid cards, while some of the transactions are processed on debit networks, are currently exempt from the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

CARD Act 

&#160;

As an agent of, and third-party service provider to, our issuing banks, we are subject to indirect regulation and direct audit and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

&#160;

On March 23, 2010, the FRB issued a final rule implementing Title IV of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, which imposes requirements relating to disclosures, fees and expiration dates that are generally applicable to gift certificates, store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards. We believe that our general purpose reloadable prepaid cards, and the maintenance fees charged on our general purpose reloadable cards, are exempt from the requirements under this rule, as they fall within an express exclusion for cards which are reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate. However, this exclusion is not available if the issuer, the retailer selling the card to a consumer or the program manager, promotes, even if occasionally, the use of the card as a gift card or gift certificate. As a result, we provide retailers with instructions and policies regarding the display and promotion of our general purpose reloadable cards. However, it is possible that despite our instructions and policies to the contrary, a retailer engaged in offering our general purpose reloadable cards to consumers could take an action with respect to one or more of the cards that would cause each similar card to be viewed as being marketed or labeled as a gift card, such as by placing our general purpose reloadable cards on a display which prominently features the availability of gift cards and does not separate or otherwise distinguish our general purpose reloadable cards from the gift cards. In such event, it is possible that such general purpose reloadable cards would lose their eligibility for such exclusion to the CARD Act and its requirements, and therefore could be deemed to be in violation of the CARD Act and the rule, which could result in the imposition of fines, the suspension of our ability to offer our general purpose reloadable cards, civil liability, criminal liability, and the inability of our issuing banks to apply certain fees to our general purpose reloadable cards, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on our revenues.

&#160;

&#160;

In 2014, we resumed issuing gift cards. Any gift cards we issue will be governed by the CARD Act and other various regulations. Any violations with our gift card issuance could result in the imposition of fines, the suspension of our ability to offer our gift cards, civil liability, criminal liability, and the inability of our issuing banks to apply certain fees to our gift cards, each of which would likely have a material adverse impact on our revenues.

&#160;

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulation 

&#160;

Our business is subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or collectively, the BSA. The BSA, among other things, requires money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records.

&#160;

We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations.

&#160;

Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process.

&#160;

Prepaid Services 

&#160;

Prepaid card programs managed by us are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. As regulations evolve or change we may be required to obtain state licenses to expand our distribution network for prepaid cards, which licenses we may not be able to obtain. Furthermore, the CARD Act and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation E impose requirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. These laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and sometimes inconsistent and subject to judicial and regulatory challenge and interpretation, and therefore the extent to which these laws and rules have application to, and their impact on, us, financial institutions, merchants or others is in flux. At this time we are unable to determine the impact that the clarification of these laws and their future interpretations, as well as new laws, may have on us, financial institutions, merchants or others in a number of jurisdictions. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks with which we and the card issuers do business. The programs in place to process these products generally may be modified by the payment networks at their discretion and such modifications could also impact us, financial institutions, merchants and others.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 22 full-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are very good.
