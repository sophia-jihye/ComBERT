 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. (individually referred to herein as the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; and together with all its subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as &#8220;Nicolet,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and under the bank holding company laws of the State of Wisconsin.

&#160;

Nicolet is a Wisconsin corporation, originally incorporated on April 5, 2000 as Green Bay Financial Corporation, a Wisconsin corporation, to serve as the holding company for and the sole shareholder of Nicolet National Bank. It amended and restated its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. on March 14, 2002. It subsequently became the holding company for Nicolet National Bank upon the completion of the bank&#8217;s reorganization into a holding company structure on June 6, 2002. Nicolet elected to become a financial holding company in 2008.

&#160;

Nicolet conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, Nicolet National Bank, a commercial bank which was organized in 2000 as a national bank under the laws of the United States and opened for business, in Green Bay, Brown County, Wisconsin, on November 1, 2000 (referred to herein as &#8220;Nicolet National Bank,&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). Structurally, Nicolet also wholly owns a registered investment advisory firm that principally provides investment strategy and transactional services to select community banks, wholly owns an investment subsidiary of the Bank that is based in Nevada, and entered into a joint venture that provides for 50% ownership of the building in which Nicolet is headquartered. These subsidiaries are closely related to or incidental to the business of banking and none are individually or collectively significant to Nicolet&#8217;s financial position or results.

&#160;

Nicolet National Bank is a full-service community bank, offering traditional banking products and services, and wealth management products and services, to businesses and individuals in the markets it serves, delivered through a branch network serving northeast and central Wisconsin communities and Menominee, Michigan, as well as through on-line and mobile banking capabilities.

&#160;

Since its opening in late 2000, Nicolet has supplemented its organic growth with the December 2003 purchase of a branch and deposits in Menominee, Michigan, the July 2010 purchase of 4 branches and deposits in Brown County, the April 2013 merger transaction with Mid-Wisconsin Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;Mid-Wisconsin&#8221;), and the August 2013 acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of Bank of Wausau through a transaction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;).

&#160;

On September 8, 2015, Nicolet announced the signing of an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Baylake Corp. (&#8220;Baylake&#8221; (NASDAQ: BYLK) pursuant to which Baylake will merge with and into Nicolet. As of December 31, 2015, Baylake had total assets of $1.1 billion, loans of $743 million, deposits of $866 million and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $114 million. The merger with Baylake is expected to close in April 2016.

&#160;

3&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, Nicolet had total assets of $1.2 billion, loans of $877 million, deposits of $1.1 billion and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $110 million. Nicolet&#8217;s profitability is significantly dependent upon net interest income (interest income earned on loans and other interest-earning assets such as investments, net of interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds), and noninterest income sources (including but not limited to service charges on deposits, trust and brokerage fees, and mortgage income from sales of residential mortgages into the secondary market), offset by the level of the provision for loan losses, noninterest expenses (largely employee compensation and overhead expenses tied to processing and operating the Bank&#8217;s business), and income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Nicolet earned net income of $11.4 million, and after $0.2 million of preferred stock dividends, net income available to common shareholders was $11.2 million or $2.57 per diluted common share.

&#160; 

Products and Services Overview 

&#160; 

Nicolet&#8217;s principal business is banking, consisting of lending and deposit gathering, as well as ancillary banking-related products and services, to businesses and individuals of the communities it serves, and the operational support to deliver, fund and manage such banking products and services. Additionally, the Bank offers trust, brokerage and other investment management services for individuals and retirement plan services for business customers. Nicolet delivers its products and services through 21 branch locations, on-line banking, mobile banking and an interactive website. Nicolet&#8217;s call center also services customers.

&#160;

Nicolet offers a variety of loans, deposits and related services to business customers (especially small and medium-sized businesses and professional concerns), including but not limited to: business checking and other business deposit products and cash management services, international banking services, business loans, lines of credit, commercial real estate financing, construction loans, agricultural real estate or production loans, and letters of credit, as well as retirement plan services. Similarly, Nicolet offers a variety of banking products and services to consumers, including but not limited to: residential mortgage loans and mortgage refinancing, home equity loans and lines of credit, residential construction loans, personal loans, checking, savings and money market accounts, various certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts, safe deposit boxes, and personal brokerage, trust and fiduciary services. Nicolet also provides on-line services including commercial, retail and trust on-line banking, automated bill payment, mobile banking deposits and account access, remote deposit capture, and telephone banking, and other services such as wire transfers, courier services, debit cards, credit cards, pre-paid gift cards, direct deposit, official bank checks and U.S. savings bonds.

&#160;

Lending is critical to Nicolet&#8217;s balance sheet and earnings potential. Nicolet seeks creditworthy borrowers principally within the geographic area of its branch locations. As a community bank with experienced commercial lenders and residential mortgage lenders, the Bank&#8217;s primary lending function is to make commercial loans [consisting of commercial, industrial, and business loans and lines of credit, owner-occupied commercial real estate (&#8220;owner-occupied CRE&#8221;), and agricultural (&#8220;AG&#8221;) production loans]; commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loans [consisting of investment real estate loans (&#8220;CRE investment&#8221;), AG real estate, and construction and land development loans]; residential real estate loans (consisting of residential first lien mortgages, junior lien mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, and to a lesser degree residential construction loans); and other loans, mainly consumer in nature. As of December 31, 2015, Nicolet&#8217;s loan portfolio mix was as follows:

&#160;

Loan category &#160; % of Total Loans &#160; Commercial &#38; industrial &#160; &#160; 34 % Owner-occupied CRE &#160; &#160; 21 % AG production &#160; &#160; 1 % Total commercial loans &#160; &#160; 56 % AG real estate &#160; &#160; 5 % CRE investment &#160; &#160; 9 % Construction &#38; land development &#160; &#160; 4 % Total CRE loans &#160; &#160; 18 % Residential construction &#160; &#160; 1 % Residential first mortgages &#160; &#160; 18 % Residential junior mortgages &#160; &#160; 6 % Total residential real estate loans &#160; &#160; 25 % Other &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160;

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Lending involves credit risk. Nicolet has and follows extensive loan policies and procedures to standardize processes, meet compliance requirements and prudently manage underwriting, credit and other risks. Credit risk is further controlled and monitored through active asset quality management including the use of lending standards, thorough review of current and potential borrowers through Nicolet&#8217;s underwriting process, close relationships with and regular check-ins with borrowers, and active asset quality administration. For further discussion of credit risk management, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,&#8221; under Part II, Item 7.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, Nicolet had approximately 280 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by unions.

&#160;

Market Area and Competition 

&#160; 

Nicolet National Bank is a full-service community bank, providing a full range of traditional commercial and retail banking services, as well as wealth management services, throughout northeastern and central Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Nicolet markets its services to owner-managed companies, the individual owners of these businesses, and other residents of its market area, which at December 31, 2015 is through 21 branches located within 9 Wisconsin counties (Brown, Outagamie, Marinette, Taylor, Clark, Marathon, Oneida, Price and Vilas) and in Menominee, Michigan. Based on deposit market share data published by the FDIC as of June 30, 2015, the Bank ranks in the top three of market share for Brown, Taylor and Clark counties and in the top five for Menominee, Marinette and Price counties.

&#160;

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Nicolet competes for loans, deposits and wealth management or financial services in all its principal markets. Nicolet competes directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our markets (some that may have an established customer base or name recognition), internet-based banks, out-of-market banks that advertise or otherwise serve its markets, money market and other mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current or procure new customers, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of products or services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits or earned on loans, as well as to deliver other aspects of banking competitively. Many of Nicolet&#8217;s competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, broader geographic presence, more accessible branches or more advanced technologic delivery of products or services, more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination or operating costs.

&#160;

We believe our competitive pricing, personalized service and community engagement enable us to effectively compete in our markets. Nicolet employs seasoned banking and wealth management professionals with experience in its market areas and who are active in their communities. Nicolet&#8217;s emphasis on meeting customer needs in a relationship-focused manner, combined with local decision making on extensions of credit, distinguishes Nicolet from its competitors, particularly in the case of large financial institutions. Nicolet believes it further distinguishes itself by providing a range of products and services characteristic of a large financial institution while providing the personalized service, real conversation, and convenience characteristic of a local, community bank.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

Set forth below is an explanation of the major pieces of legislation and regulation affecting the banking industry and how that legislation and regulation affects Nicolet&#8217;s actions. The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of Nicolet or Nicolet National Bank, and legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities may significantly affect their operations. We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation may have on the future business and earnings of Nicolet or Nicolet National Bank. 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies.

&#160;

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole or on Nicolet&#8217;s and Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are in the process of being implemented while other aspects remain subject to further rulemaking. These regulations will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on Nicolet, its customers or the financial industry more generally. However, it is likely that the Dodd-Frank Act will increase the regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for Nicolet and Nicolet National Bank. Some of the rules that have been adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s mandates are discussed below.

&#160;

Regulation of Nicolet 

&#160;

Because Nicolet owns all of the capital stock of Nicolet National Bank, it is a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;). As a result, Nicolet is primarily subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). As a bank holding company located in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (the &#8220;WDFI&#8221;) also regulates and monitors all significant aspects of its operations.

&#160;

Acquisitions of Banks . The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:

&#160;

&#183; acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank&#8217;s voting shares; &#183; acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or &#183; merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. &#160;

Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly, substantially lessen competition, or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved in the transaction and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is discussed below.

&#160;

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, if adequately capitalized and adequately managed, Nicolet or any other bank holding company located in Wisconsin may purchase a bank located outside of Wisconsin. Conversely, an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company located outside of Wisconsin may purchase a bank located inside Wisconsin. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. 

&#160;

Change in Bank Control . Subject to various exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control.

&#160;

Permitted Activities . The Bank Holding Company Act has generally prohibited a bank holding company from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act have expanded the permissible activities of a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities. Those activities include, among other activities, certain insurance, advisory and security activities. 

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Nicolet meets the qualification standards applicable to financial holding companies, and elected to become a financial holding company in 2008. In order to remain a financial holding company, Nicolet must continue to be considered well managed and well capitalized by the Federal Reserve, and Nicolet National Bank must continue to be considered well managed and well capitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) and have at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.

&#160;

Support of Subsidiary Institutions . Under Federal Reserve policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, Nicolet is expected to act as a source of financial strength for Nicolet National Bank and to commit resources to support Nicolet National Bank. This support may be required at times when, without this Federal Reserve policy or the related rules, Nicolet might not be inclined to provide it.

&#160;

In addition, any capital loans made by Nicolet to Nicolet National Bank will be repaid only after Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy . Nicolet is subject to capital requirements applied on a consolidated basis, which are substantially similar to those required of Nicolet National Bank, which are summarized below.

&#160; 

Dividend Restrictions . Under Federal Reserve policies, bank holding companies may pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs and financial condition and if the organization is not in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements. Federal Reserve policy also provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.

&#160;

In addition, when Nicolet received a capital investment from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the &#8220;Treasury&#8221;) under the Small Business Lending Fund (the &#8220;SBLF&#8221;) on September 1, 2011, it became subject to certain contractual limitations on the payment of dividends. These limitations require, among other things, that (1) all dividends for the SBLF Preferred Stock be paid before other dividends can be paid and (2) no dividends on or repurchases of Nicolet common stock will be permitted if such repurchase or payment of such dividends would reduce Nicolet&#8217;s Tier 1 capital by more than 10% from the level on the SBLF closing date.

&#160; 

Regulation of Nicolet National Bank 

&#160;

Because Nicolet National Bank is chartered as a national bank, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the National Bank Act and the regulations of the OCC. The OCC regularly examines Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s operations and has the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. The OCC also has the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Because Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law, it is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC also has examination authority and back-up enforcement power over Nicolet National Bank. Nicolet National Bank is also subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect Nicolet, its business, activities, and operations. 

&#160; 

Branching. National banks are required by the National Bank Act to adhere to branching laws applicable to state banks in the states in which they are located. Under Wisconsin law and the Dodd-Frank Act, and with the prior approval of the OCC, Nicolet National Bank may open branch offices within or outside of Wisconsin, provided that a state bank chartered by the state in which the branch is to be located would also be permitted to establish a branch. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, Nicolet National Bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Wisconsin or other states.

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy. Banks and bank holding companies, as regulated institutions, are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted minimum risk-based capital requirements (Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and total capital) and leverage capital requirements, as well as guidelines that define components of the calculation of capital and the level of risk associated with various types of assets. Financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines.

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to the minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, banking organizations must maintain a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of CET1 in an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions and to pay certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In order to avoid those restrictions, the capital conservation buffer effectively increases the minimum CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital ratios for U.S. banking organizations to 7.0%, 8.5%, and 10.5%, respectively. Banking organizations with capital levels that fall within the buffer will be required to limit dividends, share repurchases or redemptions (unless replaced within the same calendar quarter by capital instruments of equal or higher quality), and discretionary bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer is phased in over a 5-year period beginning January 1, 2016.

&#160;

The following table presents the risk-based and leverage capital requirements applicable to the Bank:

&#160;

&#160; Adequately Capitalized Requirement Well-Capitalized Requirement Well-Capitalized with Buffer, fully phased in 2019 Leverage 4.0% 5.0% 5.0% CET1 4.5% 6.5% 7.0% Tier 1 6.0% 8.0% 8.5% Total Capital 8.0% 10.0% 10.5% &#160;

Although capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares were required by the Dodd-Frank Act to be phased-out of Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016, for certain larger banking organizations, Nicolet&#8217;s trust preferred securities are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 capital (provided they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital) as a result of Nicolet qualifying as a smaller entity.

&#160;

The capital rules require that goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;DTLs&#8221;), be deducted from CET1 capital. Additionally, deferred tax assets (&#8220;DTAs&#8221;) that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of associated DTLs and valuation allowances, are fully deducted from CET1 capital. However, DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, along with mortgage servicing assets and &#8220;significant&#8221; (defined as greater than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution) investments in the common stock of unconsolidated &#8220;financial institutions&#8221; are partially includible in CET1 capital, subject to deductions defined in the rules.

&#160;

The OCC also considers interest rate risk (arising when the interest rate sensitivity of the Bank&#8217;s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance-sheet position) in the evaluation of the bank&#8217;s capital adequacy. Banks with excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to hold additional amounts of capital against their exposure to losses resulting from that risk. Through the risk-weighting of assets, the regulators also require banks to incorporate market risk components into their risk-based capital. Under these market risk requirements, capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a bank&#8217;s lending and trading activities.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s capital categories are determined solely for the purpose of applying the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; rules described below and they are not necessarily an accurate representation of its overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and certain other restrictions on its business. See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action&#8221; below.

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;) establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, in which all institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have also specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category.

&#160;

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; bank is one that is not required to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure, pursuant to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive, and, for 2015, has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. Generally, a classification as well capitalized will place a bank outside of the regulatory zone for purposes of prompt corrective action. However, a well-capitalized bank may be reclassified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; based on criteria other than capital, if the federal regulator determines that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, which requires certain remedial action.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Nicolet National Bank satisfied the requirements of &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. See Note 18, &#8220;Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions of Dividends,&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under Part II, Item 8, for Nicolet and Nicolet National Bank regulatory capital ratios.

&#160;

As a bank&#8217;s capital position deteriorates, federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Assessments. Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law, which was permanently increased to $250,000 by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC uses the Deposit Insurance Fund to protect against the loss of insured deposits if an FDIC-insured bank or savings association fails. Nicolet National Bank is thus subject to FDIC deposit premium assessments. The cost of premium assessments are impacted by, among other things, a bank&#8217;s capital category under the prompt corrective action system.

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Lending. The federal banking regulators have issued the following guidance to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate lending risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:

&#160;

&#183; total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital, or &#160;

&#183; total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of the institution&#8217;s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more. &#160;

At December 31, 2015 Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate lending levels are below the guidance levels noted above.

&#160; 

Enforcement Powers . The Financial Institution Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (&#8220;FIRREA&#8221;) expanded and increased civil and criminal penalties available for use by the federal regulatory agencies against depository institutions and certain &#8220;institution-affiliated parties.&#8221; Institution-affiliated parties primarily include management, employees, and agents of a financial institution, as well as independent contractors and consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution&#8217;s affairs. These practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the filing of false or misleading information or the submission of inaccurate reports. Civil penalties may be as high as $1,100,000 per day for such violations. Criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes have been increased to 20 years.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on Nicolet National Bank. Additionally, Nicolet National Bank must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements.

&#160;

9&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Payment of Dividends. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s payment of dividends to Nicolet. If, in the opinion of the OCC, Nicolet National Bank were engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, the OCC could require that Nicolet National Bank stop or refrain from engaging in the practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

&#160;

Nicolet National Bank is required by federal law to obtain prior approval of the OCC for payments of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by Nicolet National Bank in any year will exceed (1) the total of Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s net profits for that year, plus (2) Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The payment of dividends may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines or any conditions or restrictions that may be imposed by regulatory authorities.

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders . Nicolet National Bank is subject to the provisions of Regulation W promulgated by the Federal Reserve, which encompasses Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulation W places limits and conditions on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to, investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates. Regulation W also prohibits, among other things, an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Federal law also places restrictions on Nicolet National Bank&#8217;s ability to extend credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit: must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties; and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

&#160; 

USA PATRIOT Act . The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#34;USA PATRIOT Act&#34;) requires each financial institution to: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program; and (ii) establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect to its private and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks. In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act encourages cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities.

&#160; 

Customer Protection . Nicolet National Bank is also subject to consumer laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with depository institutions, as well as other laws or regulations affecting customers of financial institutions generally. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers.

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as Nicolet National Bank, will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.

&#160; 

UDAP and UDAAP. Bank regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address &#34;unethical&#34; or otherwise &#34;bad&#34; business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act&#8212;the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce (&#34;UDAP&#34; or &#34;FTC Act&#34;). &#34;Unjustified consumer injury&#34; is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the UDAP law. However, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to &#34;unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices&#34; (&#34;UDAAP&#34;), which has been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has brought a variety of enforcement actions for violations of UDAAP provisions and CFPB guidance continues to evolve.

Mortgage Reform. The CFPB has adopted final rules implementing minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including standards regarding a customer's ability to repay, restricting variable-rate lending by requiring that the ability to repay variable-rate loans be determined by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans, new disclosures, and certain other revisions. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB.
