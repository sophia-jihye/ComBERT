 Item 1. &#160; Business 

With the acquisition of Defense Technology Corporation ("DTC"), Defense Technologies International Corp. (formerly Canyon Gold Corp.) plans to bring defense detection and protection products to market intended to improve security for military personnel, schools and other public facilities.

During the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company did not make certain payments related to its mining lease claims located in the State of Nevada. As a result, on May 11, 2016, the Company renewed its claims and is required to pay the associated fees within 90 days of the renewal. The Company anticipates completing the payment of fees by August 5, 2016. As a result of the renewal of the claims in May 2016, the Company currently holds these claims. According to SEC Industry Guide No. 7, we are classified or considered an exploration stage mineral company defined as a company engaged in the search for mineral deposits or reserves of precious and base metal targets, which are not in either the development or production stage. Subsequent to the completion of the DTC acquisition, the Company intends to use its reasonable best efforts to effectuate a possible spin-off of its subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. ("Long Canyon"), on terms to be determined.

&#160;

Our principal executive office is located at 4730 South Fort Apache Road, Suite 300, Las Vegas, Nevada 89147, telephone (1-800) 520-9485. Additional office space is subleased from EMAC at 641 West 3rd Street, North Vancouver BC, Canada. The office of DRLLC that is responsible for management of exploration program is located at 125 East Main Street # 307, American Fork, Utah 84003.

Corporate Name Change

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 27, 1998. Effective June 15, 2016, the Company changed its name from Canyon Gold Corp. to Defense Technologies International Corp. to more fully represent the Company's expansion goals into the advanced technology sector.

&#160;

Defense Technology Corporation Acquisition

On October 5, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Defense Technology Corporation, a privately held Colorado limited liability company ("DTC") with principal offices in New Port Richey, Florida. The agreement provides that the Company acquire from Jeffrey Vanalstine, President of DTC, the one outstanding share of DTC that represents 100% of its shares. DTC is the developer of defense, detection and protection products to improve security for military personnel and schools and other public facilities. DTC maintains a website at www.defensetechnologycorporation.com.

We previously intended to close the transaction on December 31, 2015, however we extended the date to allow additional time for due diligence and for DTC to finalized requisite documents and financial statements. On July 15, 2016, we executed necessary closing documents to finalize the acquisition of DTC, which became our wholly owned subsidiary. DTC is required to deliver to the Company its audited financial statements in order that they can be included with the Company's consolidated financial statements. Within ten days of completion of DTC's audited financial statements, the Company will appoint Jeff Vanalstine to the Company's Board of Directors, and will appoint Merrill Moses, President of the Company, to the DTC Board of Directors. 

&#160;

In consideration for acquiring DTC, the Company has authorized the issuance of 4,000,000 shares of voting Common Stock to Mr. Vanalstine and certain of DTC's note holders. The shares will be restricted from trading for a period of one year and will thereafter be released on a quarterly basis. Additionally, DTC will be able to earn certain additional Series "B" Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company upon attaining certain gross sales milestones.

&#160;

DTC was formed in 2007 to bring products to market in the areas of personal and collateral protection. DTC operates in the markets of personal and collateral protection by creating technology that is unique in design and operation. DTC currently has two products in development that they believe will impact their respective industries.

DTC has assembled a team of experts that have built relationships in target markets spanning over three years, enabling the company to deal directly with the decision makers specific to its products. DTC has presented to state and federal government departments and is positioned to move forward with the sale of products.

DTC's business model is based on the hub and spoke system operating in an identified market with a direct connection to decision makers. The markets for its lead product are the 105,000 U.S. public and private schools, colleges and universities. The core customer base is government, specifically federal, state, and regional, together with international replication and future commercial applications.

Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp.

On July 20, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the issued shares of Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. ("Long Canyon"), a private British Columbia, Canada Corporation, incorporated on June 19, 2008, in a share for share exchange accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization. In May 2016, Long Canyon renewed leases for 30 BLM mineral lease claims, situated in the west section of the new Long Canyon Gold Trend area of east central Nevada. The claims had previously lapsed due to late payment of the annual lease obligations. Each of the 30 claims in Section 35 is a Federal BLM unpatented lode claims, 20 acres in size and includes placer rights in Nevada. The actual area of the 30 claims is 600 acres and the balance of approximately 40 acres in Section 35 consists of a slough and swampy pond area. The claims were initially listed as CG #1 through CG#30.

&#160;

In exchange for the acquisition of Long Canyon, we issued to the stockholders of Long Canyon 27,998,699 shares of our common stock and 500,000 Series B preferred shares, which are convertible into a total of 5.0 million of our common shares. The Series B preferred shares were assigned to Development Resources LLC ("DRLLC") as consideration for the 30 BLM mineral lease claims previously acquired by Long Canyon from DRLLC. On July 22, 2011, we issued to EMAC, 600,000 Series A preferred shares, convertible into 6.0 million shares of common stock. The Series A preferred shares satisfied certain payables to EMAC in connection with Long Canyon's acquisition of mineral claims and certain related party payables. The payables refer to certain executive and administrative services provided to the Company and Long Canyon. Also, at the time of the Long Canyon acquisition, Long Canyon and the Company agreed that the 600,000 Series A preferred shares would be transferred to EMAC in consideration for a payable to EMAC. The preferred shares are only convertible into common stock starting 12 months after the first day that our common stock is traded on the on the OTC-Bulletin Board, now the OTCQB.

We have engaged DRLLC of American Fork, Utah to conduct preliminary studies of our claims as funding permits. We intend to conduct exploration activities on the properties in phases. We plan to explore for gold, silver and other minerals on the property covering an area of approximately 640 acres. There can be no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on our property or that we will be successful in raising the funding to continue our exploration activities. Extensive exploration will be required before we can make a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of any potential deposit.

&#160;

Abandoned Vaportech Acquisition

On June 6, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire 90% of Vaportech3d LLC, a privately held Nevada limited liability company, formerly known as EMAC Holdings, LLC, a related party, ("Vaportech"), owner of the Cedar Leaf Oil Vapor Technology. Based on the due diligence performed, on September 8, 2015, the parties entered into an agreement to cancel the acquisition.

DTC Business Opportunity

Our immediate goal is to reorganize the existing indebtedness of DTC and to provide an estimated $25,000 for the completion of the initial production of DTC's Offender Alert Passive Scan. The Offender Alert Passive Scan is an advanced passive scanning system for detecting and identifying concealed threats. The unit can be installed into a door frame with no visual presence, providing covert detection, or can be installed as a stand-alone unit for portable operation.

The passive scan consists of eight highly developed sensors that read the constantly changing variations in the earth's magnetic field. These same sensors have applications in places such as along the San Andreas fault line, where they measure changes in the earth's magnetic fields to anticipate earthquake activity.

The system is a frame that can be installed in a doorway, and can be installed covertly, or can operate as a free standing unit for portable use. Because the earth's magnetic field is never static, the system constantly self-adjusts. When a subject passes through the "curtain" with something of a metallic nature, an invisible wave of variation is generated where the signal has the greatest strength. 

&#160;

The program provides a visual image of where the items are located on the suspect, as well as an approximation of the size of the item (with optional equipment). With cameras available at the facility, the system will instantly relay the image of the suspect, position and time of the offending alert. The picture can be transmitted to security, management or any designated recipient and can be retained in the memory log of the computer.

With the use of electromagnets, the system emits nothing through the subject and is passive; it simply reads the ambient environment and the variations that occur as a person passes between two specific points. Contrary to existing scanning and detection technology, the system emits no energy. The DTC system is able to detect objects such as cell phones, knives, and firearms including covert handguns.

Scanner systems currently in the market are effectively an X-RAY in some form; existing scanning technology emits a signal from one side of a scanning unit, through the subject, to the other side of the unit. The Offender Alert technology does not rely on X-RAYS, and its competitively priced at less than half the cost of similar units now in use in the marketplace.

We currently estimate the first installation of the Offender Alert in the third quarter of calendar year 2016.

Current Minerals Business

Our current mineral property interests are comprised of 30 BLM mineral lease claims, situated in the west section of the new Long Canyon Gold Trend area of east central Nevada. &#160; These properties are located next to other exploration projects owned by other mining companies in the Long Canyon Gold Trend. All of the claims are located in Section 35, T 34N R63E, Mount Diablo Base &#38; Meridian (Meridian MDB&#38;M). We intend to explore the claims for gold and silver mineralization deposits as funding permits. 

The property rights to each claim are acquired by first staking the ground with a legal marker wooden post with identification of the location, date of staking location and owners name attached to each post. The locator or owner then has a period of time to then file the Mining Claim Notices with the County Recorder's office and, in this case, in Elko County, Nevada. A fee is paid for this filing and a County Stamp with the date of such recording is put on each Claim Location Notice. The locator or owner then has up to 90 days from the location date on the Claim Notice to file and pay an additional fee to the BLM in Reno, Nevada to record the ownership of each claim with the BLM. The locator or owner is then officially listed with both the County and the BLM as having the mineral claim control to the claims and holds complete ownership interest in the surface rights and subsurface rights to all minerals on the claims up to the new required notice to hold date, which is the following next September 1 date from the date of the location on the Claim Notice. It is officially recognized that the locator or owner has such rights on the ground that each claim is located on from the date the posts are put in the ground on the claim with the attached document as well until the proper recording dates required by the County and the BLM.

In January 2012, DRLLC prepared the preliminary geological report on our properties. Alex Burton of Burton Consulting Inc., was the consulting geologist for DRLLC and conducted additional fieldwork from May 19 to May 29, 2012 as part of the requirements for dissemination of his final geology report. Mr. Burton, an exploration geologist and geochemist, has become a member of our advisory board. Titles to the 30 claims (approximately 640 acres) were originally recorded in the name of DRLLC; however the title has been transferred to the Company. 

Our agreement with DRLLC obligated Long Canyon to pay to DRLLC $30,000 to complete full staking and acquisition of mineral lease claims. DRLLC would then assign to Long Canyon a 100% interest in the claims, subject to DRLLC holding a 3% Net Smelter Royalty on the claims. Long Canyon is further obligated to pay all BLM and State of Nevada registration fees and to perform initial exploration work on the claims. Also, DRLLC will retain a first right of refusal to buy back the claims in the event the Company intends to sell the claims.

We will conduct exploration activities on the properties in phases. We intend to explore for gold, silver and other minerals on the property covering an area of approximately 640 acres. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on our property. Extensive exploration will be required before we can make a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of any potential deposit.

Exploration Properties

&#160;

Our mineral lease properties are located in the Long Canyon Gold Trend in the Spruce Mountain Mining District, Nevada. The area is generally characterized by an average elevation of approximately 5,600 feet and is made up of gentle rising hills and ridges to about 6,000 feet to the west and 5,800 feet to the east. The ridges and elevation increase to the south to an elevation of 6,800 feet at Ventosa Peak. The highest elevation in the district is Spruce Mountain at an elevation of just over 10,000 feet, located approximately 16 miles due south of our claims. The trees on these properties are small Spruce, Pine and scrub brush, not densely covered with many open areas on the higher ridges and side slopes with open areas in the small valleys at lower elevations.

All of our claims are located in one block in a semi-remote area with no infrastructure in place. The only access to the properties is by historic gravel or dirt roads and trails. There is no current access to water or power, although we do not foresee a need during the first phases of exploration. Typically, all contract personnel carry their own water and have portable generators for their operations, including phase two drill programs. Drilling operators supply tanker trucks for their water needs.

In the event an ore body is discovered as a result of our exploration programs, significant additional funding would be necessary to proceed. In order to satisfy this need, we anticipate seeking a strategic partnership or joint venture with a much larger mining company in order to fund additional heavy exploration drilling, feasibility studies and establishing mining operations. A feasibility study would detail the costs to provide all infrastructure including, but not limited to, pumping water from underground sources or building lakes to hold such water needs, building electrical lines to the area for needed power or using standalone large generator systems to provide necessary power. It is our intent to remain an exploration company and to seek a partner to further develop and operate our properties. Presently, there can be no assurance that we will discover minerals in a commercially viable amount or that we would be able to secure a strategic partner to provide necessary funding to become operational.

Regulatory Requirements

In order to maintain the Company's claims and/or leases, we must make annual payments to the Bureau Land Management (" BLM ") and State of Nevada, due in September of each year. Payment to the BLM is $145 per claim and the State of Nevada is $70 per claim. We currently own the 30 BLM mineral leases for which we are obligated to make annual payments.

Phase one of our exploration program, completing a preliminary geological report on our four sections of BLM mineral lease claims, required no permits or bonding, provided there was no surface land disturbance of more than one-third acre. Phase two, provided preliminary geological reports are favorable and funding is available, will proceed with a drill program to confirm mineralization on these target areas from the surface to depth. If initial core samples show evidence of gold mineralization, a geological grid map will be produced to lay out an extensive drill program to define a potential mineable ore body. Phase two will require an "Access and Land Use Permit" from the BLM and State of Nevada. Generally, this will require about 30 days for the filing process and cost approximately $12,000 for a bond to assure the reclamation of the subject areas.

.

Royalties

Presently, we are committed to pay a 3% Net Smelter Royalty (" NSR ") to DRLLC on all of our 30 claims pursuant to the agreement between DRLLC and Long Canyon.

History

Spruce Mountain Mining District

Our properties lie at the north end of the Spruce Mountain district, in southern Elko County, approximately 19 miles south of Wells, Nevada. The properties are located near Highway 93 on the old Tobar Road, which provides easy access to the area. The Spruce Mountain district covers the north flank and summit of Spruce Mountain and part of the Spruce Mountain Ridge to the north. Spruce Mountain and Spruce Mountain Ridge form a somewhat isolated spur between the Pequop Mountains on the east and Clover Valley on the west.

Spruce Mountain has seen mining activity since 1869. During the early years, small communities such as Sprucemont, Spruce, Hickneytown, Monarch, Black Forest, Latham, Jasper, Steptoe, Johnson, and Killie were founded and then declined. These mining camps stretched for six miles, from the western to the eastern slopes of Spruce Mountain. In 1869, W.B. Latham discovered the Latham mine, later renamed the Killie. The lead-silver ore was sufficiently valuable that a small rush of prospectors came to the area. Within months, three new mines, the Black Forest, the Juniper, and the Fourth of July, began production.

Three separate mining districts, the Latham, Johnson and Steptoe districts, were initially created in the Spruce Mountain area. On September 26, 1871, the three districts were consolidated, and the Spruce Mountain Mining District was created.

From 1869 to the 1930's, lead, silver, copper and zinc were produced from several underground mines in the Spruce Mountain district. The Standard and Old Paramount mines are on the RenGold Spruce Mountain property. Several other historical underground workings are located to the east of the property.

No production has taken place on Spruce Mountain since 1961. Some exploration occurred through the 1980s, but none were considered worthy of extensive mining. Between 1958 and 1982, several companies conducted exploration for porphyry molybdenum deposits throughout the district. In 1984 and 1985, Santa Fe Mining Inc. remapped the western portion of the district, took rock and soil samples, conducted a VLF survey and drilled 33 RC holes, 30 of these on the Spruce Mountain property. Several of these holes intersected gold mineralization in the northern part of the Spruce Mountain property (the North Target).

In 1996 and 1997, Battle Mountain Gold Corp explored primarily to the east of the Spruce Mountain property. Between 1997 and 2009, Teck Resources, Inc. and Nevada Pacific Gold (US) Inc. explored the property. In 2009 AuEx took rock samples, staked the SM claims and quitclaimed the claims to Renaissance in 2010.

Geology

The oldest rocks exposed in the Spruce Mountain district consist of limestone of the Ordovician Pogonip Formation, which crops out on the summit and west slope of Spruce Mountain. It is overlain by, or is in fault contact with limestone, dolomite, shale, and quartzite of the Silurian through Permian ages. The sedimentary rocks are tilted gently to moderately eastward, displaced along the Spruce Mountain thrust fault, and are cut by steep north-northwest and east-trending normal faults.

The sedimentary rocks have been intruded by a granite porphyry dike that cuts across the north side of Spruce Mountain in a northeasterly direction. This porphyry, where seen near the Killie mine and east of the Black Forest mine, is bleached and kaolinized, and contains sericite, euhedral quartz phenocrysts, and some fine-grained sulfides. Many of the mines and prospects in the district are found along the trend of this porphyry dike. Three or more small or irregular stocks of granite porphyry and diorite are intruded along and near the crest of the ridge.

Limestone adjacent to some of the intrusive contacts is metamorphosed to skarn consisting of quartz, calcite, garnet, fluorite, actinolite, diopside, and other pyroxenes. The largest metamorphic zone is on the west side of the range. Between the contact zone and the main dike, there are two prominent knoblike outcrops of iron-oxide stained quartz-cemented breccias pipe. On the east side of the range, the northeastward continuation of the zone of intrusive is marked by outcrops of jasperoid.

Two kinds of metalliferous ore bodies have been mined in the Spruce Mountain district; (i) bedded replacement deposits of lead, silver, copper, and (ii) zinc in limestone and skarn, and fissure-filling stock work deposits of lead and silver with minor gold along normal faults in limestone, skarn, quartz breccias, and granite porphyry. Replacement deposits in limestone and skarn occur near the center of the district. Ore shoots were commonly a few feet thick, and as much as 100 feet long. Mineralization extended up to 100 feet away from the fissures into the limestone host rock. Bedded replacement deposits yielded most of the early production from the district.

The deepest ore shoot in the district was mined to the 520-foot level in the Monarch mine. To the northeast, at the Humbug mine and nearby prospects, outcrops of gossan and jasperoid occur in siliceous breccias along shear zones in limestone.

Most orebodies in the district were mined primarily for lead and silver, with increasing amounts of zinc recovered in the later years of production. Orebodies in which copper predominates generally occur adjacent to the intrusive bodies. Proportions of lead, silver, gold, copper, and zinc vary widely among the different orebodies.

Recent Activity

Our properties are in immediate proximity on the north to a 35 square mile area owned by Renaissance Gold, in joint venture with NuLegacy Gold. The two companies have collected soil samples and exposed rock chip samples that may indicate anomalous gold.

In February 2011, Newmont Gold acquired properties in the Spruce Mountain area and has extended its gold exploration activities. Frontier Gold and AuEx Ventures are joint venturing in exploration drilling to define a possible gold ore body in the area. AuEx Ventures has also entered into a joint venture drilling project with Agnico-Eagle USA in an area adjoining our properties to the west. The Renaissance Gold Group has formed a joint venture with NuLegacy Gold to conduct exploration activities in close proximity to our properties. Just to the south of our properties is another Renaissance Gold project called the Spruce Mountain Prospect.

Plan of Operations

With the completion of phase one of our exploration program and receipt of the final geology report and its recommendations to continue with Phase Two of the Company's exploration program, we will need an estimated $1,057,200 in funds for drilling and engineering studies to determine whether the mineral deposit is commercially viable. If we are unable to raise additional funds for this work, we would be unable to proceed, even if a mineral deposit is discovered.

Phase Two

Premised on and supported by the findings set forth in the final geology report, phase two will proceed as funds are available with continued exploration and a drill program to confirm mineralization on the target areas from the surface to depth. Typically, exploration results that will warrant phase two work include:

&#9679;

Analysis of surface geochemical sample results with values that are suggestive of a mineral deposit, when considered in the context of the geologic setting of the property;

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

Analysis of geophysical anomalies that are suggestive of a mineral deposit considered in the context of the geologic setting of the property; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679;

Interpretation of geological results that is indicative of a favorable setting for a mineral deposit.

These results are usually interpreted in conjunction with current metal-market conditions, management's corporate goals and the potential for phase two plans to facilitate the discovery process. The first phase of our two-phase exploration program on our property was completed in July 2012 and the final geology report delivered in September 2012. The final report indicates a plan for further exploration, including an initial drilling program, with recommendations and budgets.

Alex Burton, exploration geologist and geochemist and a member of our advisory board, is responsible for the final geology report. Based on the conclusions set forth in the report and the preliminary exploration results obtained in phase one, management is confident that our properties are sufficiently positioned geologically to proceed with phase two.

All core drill samples will be sent to the ALS Chemex Labs for assay results. In the event these first drill core sample assays show substantial gold mineralization, a geological grid map will be produced to lay out an extensive "in-fill" drill program to define a potential mineable ore body. Once an ore body is defined by these drill program, a feasibility report will be produced to prepare and perform an application to all Nevada regulatory agencies for mining operation permits.

Our ability to complete the two-phase exploration will be dependent on our available funds and the ability to raise additional necessary funds as required. Phase two will require renting certain heavy-duty equipment to open new trails into the target area and perform some open trenching to gather deeper samples. The following is our estimate of the cost to successfully complete the first two phases. Our estimates for phase two are based on the findings set forth in the final geology report and are divided into two stages.

Note: Please be advised of the following terms used in the table above:

IP/resistivity : During phase two, we may use a program called Induced Polarization (IP), which can be used to further define deeper mineralization zones on the properties. This is performed by placing metal electrodes at interval spacing on a laid out grid according to the suitable format for the mineralized zone and the property location. Electrical impulses are then passed through these electrodes, sending back a recorded signal that can define a certain measured decay of mineralization below the surface, thus defining potential higher-grade areas for further testing programs such as drilling.

Exposed mineralized zones : We anticipate phase one will define possible mineralized zones on the properties, which will further define potential drill targets.

Final geology report : The final geology report, provided by a qualified, licensed geologist, written to the requirements of the NI43.101 Technical Report, will describe in detail all of the exploration data, testing results and all other operations performed on the properties as well as a definitive further exploration program with suggested costs to enter into and perform the next phase of the expected exploration.

Our exploration expenditures for phase one have been $107,923 and we anticipate an additional $1,057,200 to complete phase two. Each phase of our proposed exploration will be assessed to determine whether the results warrant further work. If exploration results on the initial phases do not warrant drilling or further exploration, we will suspend operations on the property. We will then seek additional exploration properties and additional funding with which to conduct the work. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing or additional properties, we may not be able to continue active business operations.

&#160;

Historically, we have incurred operating losses and will not be able to exist indefinitely without securing additional operating funds. In the view of our independent auditors, we require additional funds to maintain our operations and these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

&#160;

We will not be conducting any product research or development over the next 12 months. We do not expect to purchase any plant or significant equipment over the next 12 months. We do not have employees and do not expect add employees over the next 12 months. Our current management team will satisfy our requirements for the foreseeable future.

Competition

&#160;

The exploration for and exploitation of mineral reserves is highly competitive with many local, national and international companies in the marketplace. We must compete against several established companies in the industry that are better financed and/or who have closer working relationships with productive mining companies. We will most likely seek a strategic relationship with a more established and larger mining company to provide assistance in developing our property into production, if exploration results so warrant. We have not entered into any agreements with any third parties to produce any minerals from our property, nor have we identified any potential partners in that regard, nor is there any assurance we will be able to secure such agreements. If we are unable to identify and/or partner with any third parties to assist us in attaining production grade minerals, we will likely be unsuccessful in producing any such minerals.

&#160;

With the acquisition of DTC, we will become engaged in the security and defense detection and protection business. We believe that world concerns for safety will result in an expanded market for security products. There are many larger and well-seasoned companies engaged in the security and protection industry and DTC has not yet finalized and marketed any products. If DTC's initial products are not successful, or we are unable to develop new and unique products, we would not be able to compete with other businesses.

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160;

Because we are engaged in the mineral exploration activities, we are exposed to many governmental and environmental risks associated with our business. We are currently in the initial exploration stages and management has not determined whether significant site reclamation costs will be required.

&#160;

Environmental and other government regulations at the federal, state and local level may include:

&#9679;

surface impact;

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

water acquisition and treatment;

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

site access;

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

reclamation;

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

wildlife preservation;

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

licenses and permits; and

&#160; &#160; &#9679;

maintaining the environment.

Regulatory compliance in the mining industry is complex and the failure to meet and satisfy various requirements can result in fines, civil or criminal penalties or other limitations.

In the event we are able to secure funding necessary to implement a bona fide exploration program, we will be subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities. In order to maintain our claims, we must make annual payments to the BLM and the State of Nevada. If we proceed to phase two drilling, we must secure an Access and Land Use Permit. Subsequently, operating and environmental permits will be required from applicable regulatory bodies using technical applications filed by us. The failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals or licenses will adversely affect our ability to explore our property and otherwise carry out our business plan.

Any exploration or production on United States Federal land will have to comply with the Federal Land Management Planning Act, which has the effect generally of protecting the environment. Any exploration or production on private property, whether owned or leased, will have to comply with the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The costs of complying with environmental concerns under any of these acts vary on a case-by-case basis. In many instances the cost can be prohibitive to development. Environmental costs associated with a particular project must be factored into the overall cost evaluation of whether to proceed with the project.

There are no costs to us at the present time except for annual fee payments related to the claims and reclamation bonding requirements of the Bureau of Land Management in connection with compliance with environmental laws. However, because we anticipate engaging in natural resource projects, these costs could occur at any time and the potential liability extensive.

Trademarks and Copyrights

&#160;

We do not own any patents, trademarks or copyrights.

Employees

&#160;

We presently do not have any employees and do not anticipate adding employees until our business operations and financial resources so warrant. We consider our current management to be sufficient to satisfy our requirements for the foreseeable future. Our exploration program is contracted to Development Resources LLC. and is payable in both cash and stock. Further, we anticipate DTC adding employees as its products are developed and readied for marketing.

&#160;

Facilities

We presently rent office facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada that serve as our principal executive offices. The facilities are rented on a month-to-month basis on terms of $497 per month.

Employee Stock Plan

We have not adopted any kind of stock or stock option plan for employees at this time.

Industry Segments

&#160;

No information is presented regarding industry segments. We are presently a development stage company that has been seeking potential business opportunities in the minerals industry. With the acquisition of DTC in July 216, we are seeking business opportunities in the defense, detection and protection products Reference is made to the consolidated statements of operations included in this Form 10-K for a report of our operating history for the past two fiscal years.
