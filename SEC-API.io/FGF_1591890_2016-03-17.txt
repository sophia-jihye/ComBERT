 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#34;we&#34;, or &#34;us&#34;) was incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware under the name Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2013 we changed our legal name to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Maison Insurance Company (&#8220;Maison&#8221;), Maison Managers, Inc. (&#8220;MMI&#8221;), and ClaimCor, LLC (&#8220;ClaimCor&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Prior to March 31, 2014, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America Inc. (&#8220;KAI&#8221;). KAI, in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services Inc. (&#8220;KFSI&#8221;), a publicly owned holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On March 31, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of its common stock and then on June 13, 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering. Through the combination of the Company&#8217;s IPO and follow-on offering, we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015 KAI and companies affiliated with KAI held approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock equivalent to approximately 17.5% of our outstanding shares. 

&#160; 

Through Maison, we began providing property and casualty insurance to individuals in Louisiana in December 2012. On May 13, 2015, the Company was notified by the Texas Department of Insurance (the &#8220;TDI&#8221;) that a Certificate of Authority had been granted to Maison, allowing us to begin writing insurance in the State of Texas. Our insurance offerings in Louisiana and Texas include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. We write both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures and we produce new policies through a network of independent insurance agents. We refer to the policies we write through independent agents as voluntary policies. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we began writing commercial business in Texas in June 2015, through an alliance with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company (&#8220;Brotherhood&#8221;). Through this alliance, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas. 

&#160; 

We have also participated in the &#8220;take-out&#8221; program implemented by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;). As the State of Louisiana has not historically been in the business of serving as an insurer, this program was implemented to reduce the number of properties insured by Citizens. Under the take-out program, state-approved insurance companies such as Maison have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by Citizens. It has been Maison&#8217;s practice to date to participate in such take-out programs, and Maison plans to continue doing so from time to time in the future. We have participated in the last four rounds of take-outs from Citizens, occurring on December 1 st of each year. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC. 

&#160;

We process claims made by our policyholders both internally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as through various third-party claims adjusting companies. These agents have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process. We believe that the retention of independent adjusters, in addition to the employment of salaried claims personnel, results in reduced loss payments, lower loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) and improved customer service for our policyholders. 

&#160; 

Maison Managers, Inc. serves as the Company&#8217;s management services subsidiary, known as a managing general agency. MMI earns commissions and a $25 per policy fee for providing policy administration, marketing, reinsurance contract negotiation, and accounting and analytical services. Both Maison and MMI are licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of the Louisiana Department of Insurance (&#8220;LDI&#8221;) and TDI. 

&#160; 

Claims Administration 

&#160; 

Claims administration and adjusting involves the handling of routine &#8220;non-catastrophic&#8221; as well as catastrophic claims. In the event of a hurricane or other catastrophic claim, our claims volume would increase significantly. Rather than increase the size of our staff in anticipation of such an event, we believe that outsourcing claims adjusting improves our operational efficiency because an appropriately selected third party will have the resources to adjust the catastrophe related claims. Accordingly, we have outsourced our claims adjusting program to certain third party adjusters with experience in Texas and Louisiana. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the service contract between Maison and MMI, MMI handles the actual claims administration for both catastrophic and non-catastrophic insurable events. In handling the claims administration, the examiner for MMI reviews all claims and loss reports, and if warranted, investigates such claims and losses. 

&#160; 

Field adjusting is outsourced to our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as third-party service providers, who, subject to company guidance and oversight, either settle or contest the claims. Approval for payment of a claim is given by MMI after careful review of the field adjuster&#8217;s report. We maintain a claims fund for the disbursement of payments to our customers after insurable events, and make deposits into the claims fund as claims are made. We pay adjusters based on a pre-determined fee schedule. Such fees could increase as a result of a catastrophic event. Although we are ultimately responsible for paying the claims made by our policyholders, we believe that outsourcing our claims handling program while maintaining an oversight function is an efficient mechanism for handling individual matters, and helps mitigate the animosity that can occur between insured and insurer. 

&#160; 

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 

&#160; 

Loss and LAE reserves represent management&#8217;s estimate of the ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The process of establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company&#8217;s independent actuaries. 

&#160; 

The table that follows sets forth year-end reserves from 2012 through 2015 and the subsequent changes in those reserves, presented on a historical basis and in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Care should be taken to avoid misinterpretation by those unfamiliar with this information or familiar with other data commonly reported by the insurance industry. The data in the table is not shown by accident year, rather a display of year-end reserves and the subsequent changes thereto.

A redundancy indicates the original estimate is higher than the current estimate whereas a deficiency indicates the original estimate is lower than the current estimate. 

&#160; 

Reinsurance 

&#160; 

Maison follows the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its risk. When an insurance company purchases reinsurance, it transfers or &#8220;cedes&#8221; all or a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer-the &#8220;reinsurer.&#8221; Although reinsurance is intended to reduce an insurance company&#8217;s risk, the ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the insurance company from its primary liability for the full amount of its policies. If the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement, the ceding company is still required to pay the insured for the loss. Maison and its reinsurance broker are selective in choosing reinsurers and they consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the financial stability of the reinsurers, the reinsurers&#8217; history of responding to claims, and their overall reputations in making such determinations. 

&#160; 

From year-to-year, both the availability of reinsurance and the costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary. These fluctuations are not subject to our control and may limit our insurance subsidiary&#8217;s ability to purchase adequate coverage. 

&#160; 

In order to limit the credit risk associated with amounts which may become due from our reinsurers, Maison uses several different reinsurers, which have an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better. Absent such rating, we have required the reinsurers to place collateral on deposit with an independent financial institution under a trust agreement for our benefit. A list of some of the reinsurance companies which we currently use includes Allianz Risk Transfer, AXIS Specialty Limited, Everest Re, DaVinci Re, Renaissance Re, Odyssey Re, Gen Re, as well as various Lloyd&#8217;s of London participating syndicates including Acappella, Amlin, Chaucer, Dale, Ren Re and Managing Agency Partners. 

&#160; 

Maison&#8217;s current reinsurance program provides protection for any storm occurring from June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016. For each event occurring within a 144-hour period, Maison receives reinsurance recoveries up to $121 million in excess of a retention of $4 million per event. The retention is the initial amount Maison incurs in loss from each storm before any reinsurance recovery is available. We have also procured another layer of reinsurance protection that may be used for any event above the $121 million, up to a maximum recovery of $15 million. If any of this $15 million coverage is not used from the first event, the remaining portion is available for additional events. This $15 million second layer coverage applies in total for all events occurring during the reinsurance period. The aggregate loss Maison would retain for two or more catastrophes occurring during the treaty year under the program is $5 million. The total cost of our catastrophe coverage will be approximately $13.0 million for the treaty year. 

&#160; 

Investments 

&#160; 

We have tailored our investment policy in an effort to minimize risk in the current financial market. Although applicable laws and regulations permit investments (within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications) in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities and real estate mortgages, as of December 31, 2015, we only invested in high quality fixed income instruments rated &#8220;BBB&#8221; or higher by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The cash balances of our subsidiaries may be invested in other types of securities subject to domiciliary state regulations, but those investments are subject to pre-approval by our investment committee and the performance of such investments must be reported to our board of directors quarterly. Our investment policy is approved by our investment committee and is reviewed on a regular basis in order to ensure that our investment policy evolves in response to changes in the financial market. Our investment policy is designed to maximize investment income within specified guidelines, with a strong emphasis on protection of principal. 

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

Our business depends upon the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable us to provide a high level of service to agents and policyholders by: processing business in a timely and efficient manner; communicating and sharing data with agents; providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums and; allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for the management of our insurance subsidiary. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and customers and increased efficiencies in processing the business of Maison and resulted in lower operating costs. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our primary goal is to continue to expand our property and casualty writings through: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Increasing our number of voluntary policies. In recent years, large national insurance companies have significantly reduced their writing of homeowners&#8217; policies in Louisiana. We believe this trend presents an opportunity to acquire a number of homeowners&#8217; policies from these national insurers. We continue to focus on expanding our relationship with our network of agents in an effort to secure new voluntary business. &#8226; Strategic acquisitions. We intend to explore growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions in coastal states, including Louisiana, and Texas. We also plan to pursue complementary books of business provided they meet our underwriting criteria. We will evaluate each opportunity based on expected economic contribution to our results and support of our market expansion initiatives. &#8226; Attracting and retaining high-quality agents. We intend to focus our marketing efforts on maintaining and improving our relationships with highly productive independent agents, as well as on attracting new high quality agents in areas with a substantial potential for growth. &#8226; Reducing our ratio of expenses to net premiums earned and using technology to increase our operating efficiency. We are committed to improving our profitability by reducing expenses through enhanced technologies and by increasing the number of policies we write through the strategic deployment of our capital. We currently outsource our policy administration and claims handling functions to third parties, which we believe results in increased service and lower expense and loss ratios. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from national and regional insurance companies, many of whom are larger and have greater financial and other resources and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies which market their products through independent agents, as well as companies with captive agents. Large national companies may have certain competitive advantages over regional companies, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs. 

&#160; 

We may also face competition from new entrants in our niche markets. In some cases, these companies may price their products below ours due to their interest in quickly growing their business in Louisiana or Texas. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price. We also compete on the basis of underwriting criteria, our distribution network and superior policy, underwriting and claims service to our agents and insureds. 

&#160; 

Some of the national and regional companies which compete with us in the homeowners&#8217; market include ASI Lloyds, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, Louisiana Farm Bureau Insurance, Safepoint Insurance Company, Imperial F&#38;C Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, Access Home Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Federated National Insurance Company, and Centauri Specialty Insurance Company.

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to the laws and regulations in Louisiana and Texas, and will be subject to the regulations of any other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. In Louisiana, it is the duty of the LDI to administer the provisions of the Louisiana Insurance Code. The purpose of the Louisiana Insurance Code is to regulate the insurance industry in all of its phases, including, but not limited to the following: licensing of insurers and producers, regulation of investments and solvency, review and approval of forms and rates, and market conduct. The LDI also conducts periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of Maison and requires us to file financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Payment of Dividends 

&#160; 

Dividends paid by Maison are restricted by the Louisiana Insurance Code. Dividends can only be paid if Maison&#8217;s paid-in capital and surplus exceed the minimum required by the Louisiana Insurance Code by one hundred percent or more, or as otherwise provided. Any dividend or distribution that when aggregated with any other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months which exceeds the lesser of (a) ten percent of the insurer&#8217;s surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or (b) the net income of the insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve month period ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding; is considered to be extra-ordinary and shall not be paid until thirty days after the LDI has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or until the LDI has approved the payment within the thirty-day period. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extra-ordinary, an insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out in dividends. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Rates and Rules 

&#160; 

Maison is subject to state laws and regulations regarding approval of rates and rules. The LDI and TDI have the exclusive authority to approve insurance rates or rate changes for all lines of property and casualty insurance in their respective states. In a competitive market, rates shall not be inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. Maison&#8217;s ability to change rates and the relative timing of the rate making process are dependent upon each state&#8217;s statutory and regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Non-renewing Policies 

&#160; 

Maison is subject to Louisiana and Texas state laws and regulations which may restrict Maison&#8217;s timing or ability to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in the states in which it operates. These laws and regulations limit the reasons for cancellation or non-renewal, typically require prior notice, and in some instances require prior approval from the respective regulatory agency. In Louisiana, no insurer may cancel or fail to renew a homeowner&#8217;s policy of insurance or increase the policy deductible that has been in effect and renewed for more than three years unless the change is based upon non-payment of premium, fraud of the insured, a material change in the risk being insured, two or more claims within a period of three years, or if continuance of such policy endangers the solvency of the insurer.

Risk of Assessment by Louisiana and Texas 

&#160; 

Maison is a member of the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana and is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code. 

&#160; 

Maison is also required to participate, as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana, in the residual insurance market programs operated by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and designated as the Coastal Plan and the Fair Plan. Maison is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code for its participation in the Coastal Plan and its participation in the Fair Plan. 

&#160; 

As a property insurer licensed in Texas, Maison is required to become a member of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (&#8220;TWIA&#8221;), which provides wind and hail coverage to coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Maison may become subject to assessment from TWIA on the second anniversary from the date in which Maison was first admitted to write insurance in Texas (May 2017) should a major loss event deplete the Association&#8217;s available loss reserves and reinsurance coverage. 

&#160; 

Insurance Regulatory Information System 

&#160; 

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System (&#8220;IRIS&#8221;) to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. Using IRIS, financial examiners develop key financial ratios in order to assess the financial condition of insurance companies such as Maison. Each ratio has an established &#8220;usual range&#8221; of results. A ratio which falls outside the usual range however, is not considered a failing result, but instead may be viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In some cases, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside of the usual range. Generally, an insurance company will become subject to additional regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside of the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, Maison had twelve of the thirteen IRIS ratio results within the usual range. The ratio with results outside of the usual range was due to the fact that Maison&#8217;s yield on investments was below the lower end of the usual range (3%) due to the general low investment yields currently realized on fixed income securities. 

&#160; 

Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of these IRIS ratio results. 

&#160; 

Risk Based Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

In the United States, a risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. Most states, including Louisiana, the domiciliary state of Maison, as well as Texas, where Maison began writing business in June 2015, have adopted the NAIC RBC requirements. In general, insurers reporting surplus with respect to policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, on December 31 st or the previous year are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, which may include discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2015, Maison&#8217;s reported surplus was considered to be in the &#8220;no action&#8221; level as defined by the state regulators. Furthermore, pursuant to the consent order approving Maison&#8217;s admission into the State of Texas, Maison has agreed to maintain a RBC ratio of 300% or more, and provide calculation of such ratio to the TDI on a periodic basis. 

&#160; 

State Deposits 

&#160; 

States routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2015, Maison held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $0.1 million as a deposit with the LDI. Maison has also established a deposit of approximately $2.0 million for the benefit of Texas policyholders via the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities pursuant to Chapter 406 of the Texas Insurance Code. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 we had twenty-two employees, fourteen of whom work at our offices in Tampa, Florida, six of whom work at our offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and two of whom work from Texas. From time to time, we employ and supplement our staff with temporary employees and consultants. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality agreements with us.
