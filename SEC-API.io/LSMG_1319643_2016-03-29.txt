BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Lode-Star Mining Inc. (formerly International Gold Corp.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2004 for the purpose of acquiring and exploring mineral properties.. Our principal executive offices are located at 13529 Skinner Road, Suite N, Cypress, Texas 77429-1775. We also maintain a Canadian business office at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 600, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 4M8. 

&#160; 

On May 12, 2015, International Gold Corp. completed a merger with its wholly owned subsidiary, Lode-Star Mining Inc., and formally assumed the subsidiary&#8217;s name by filing Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State (the &#8220;Name Change&#8221;). The subsidiary was incorporated entirely for the purpose of effecting the Name Change and the merger did not affect our corporate structure in any other way. 

Mineral Property Interest 

On December 5, 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement (the &#8220;Subscription Agreement&#8221;) with Lode Star Gold Inc. (&#8220;LSG&#8221;), a private Nevada corporation, pursuant to which we agreed to issue 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $230,180, to LSG in exchange for a 20% undivided beneficial interest in and to the mineral claims owned by LSG (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). The mineral claims, known as the &#8220;Goldfield Bonanza Project&#8221; (the &#8220;Property&#8221;), are located in the State of Nevada. 

The execution of the Subscription Agreement was one of the closing conditions of an Option Agreement dated October 4, 2014, pursuant to which we acquired the sole and exclusive option to earn up to an 80% undivided interest in and to the Property. In order to earn the additional 60% interest in the Property, we are required to fund all expenditures on the Property and pay LSG an aggregate of $5 million in cash from the Property&#8217;s mineral production proceeds in the form of a net smelter royalty (&#8220;NSR&#8221;). Until such time as we have earned the additional 60% interest, the NSR will be split 79.2% to LSG, 19.8% to us and 1% to the former Property owner. 

If we fail to make any cash payments to LSG within one year of December 11, 2014 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), we are required to pay LSG an additional $100,000, and in any subsequent years in which we fail to complete the payment of the entire $5 million described above, we must make quarterly cash payments to LSG of $25,000 until such time as we have earned the additional 60% interest in the Property. 

The Option Agreement provides that we will act as the operator on the Property and that a management committee will be formed, comprised of representatives from us and LSG, with voting based on each party&#8217;s proportionate interest, to supervise exploration of the Property and approve work programs and budgets. To the date of this report, no work programs have been approved and LSG has borne all costs in connection with operations on the Property. We expect the first work program, entailing Property-related costs for which we will be responsible, to be approved in the latter half of 2016. 

Given that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be completed, at the request of our management, LSG granted, by a letter of agreement dated November 10, 2015, a six month deferment to June 11, 2016 of the $100,000 payment otherwise due within one year of the Closing Date (i.e. on December 11, 2015) if we fail to make any cash payments to LSG. 

Change in Officers 

As a result of the Acquisition and on the Closing Date, our former President and Chief Executive officer submitted his resignation and Mark Walmesley, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and a director, as well as a director of LSG, was appointed to fill the resulting vacancies. Mr. Walmesley is now our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and a director. 

Change in Shell Company Status 

Prior to our acquisition of the mineral property interest, we were a &#8220; shell company&#8221; ( as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) since we were not generating revenues, did not own an operating business, did not have any assets other than cash and cash equivalents, and had no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with an operating company or business. We have no revenues, have losses since inception, have no direct operations, and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor. We are relying upon the sale of securities and loans to fund our operations. We have no employees and expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary.

Change in Control of Registrant 

As a result of the Acquisition, LSG acquired 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 71.2% (currently) of the total voting power of all of our outstanding voting securities. LSG assumed control from the holders of our issued and outstanding common stock, and in particular our former president, who owned approximately 24.3% of our common stock prior to the Closing Date. 

Lode-Star Gold Inc. (&#8220;LSG&#8221;) 

LSG was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 1998 for the purpose of acquiring exploration stage mineral properties. It currently has one shareholder, Lonnie Humphries, who is the spouse of Mark Walmesley, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Walmesley is also the Director of Operations and a director of LSG. 

LSG acquired the leases to the Property in 1997 and became the registered and beneficial owner of the Property on September 19, 2009. Since the earlier of those dates, it has conducted contract exploration work on the Property but has not determined whether it contains mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. 

LSG is an exploration stage company and has not generated any revenues since its inception. The Property represents its only material asset.
