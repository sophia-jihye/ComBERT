Licensed Stores

In addition to our Company-owned stores, our merchandise is sold at stores operated by licensees. Under these agreements, our merchandise is sold at American Eagle Outfitters and Aerie stores owned and operated by third party operators. Revenue recognized under license agreements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. 

As of January 30, 2016, our products are sold at 141 locations operated by licensees in 22 countries. We continue to increase the number of locations under these types of arrangements as part of our balanced approach to global expansion.

AEO Direct

We sell merchandise through our websites, ae.com and aerie.com, both domestically and internationally. The websites reinforce each particular brand&#8217;s lifestyle, and are designed to complement the in-store experience. 

Over the past several years, we have invested in building its technologies and digital capabilities. We focused our investments in three key areas: making significant advances in mobile technology, investing in digital marketing and improving the desktop experience. 

Omni-Channel

In addition to our investments in technology, we have invested in building omni-channel capabilities to better serve customers and gain operational efficiencies. These upgraded technologies have provided a single view of inventory across channels, connecting physical stores directly to our digital business, providing our customers with a more convenient and improved shopping experience. Our store-to-door tool enables store customers to seamlessly make purchases from online inventory. Additionally, we fulfill online orders at stores through our buy online, ship from store tool, improving online order fulfillment rates. We also offer a reserve online, pick up in store service to our customers. We will continue to optimize these tools and services to build ongoing improvements to the customer shopping experience.

Merchandise Suppliers

We design our merchandise, which is manufactured by third-party factories. During Fiscal 2015, we purchased substantially all of our merchandise from non-North American suppliers. For the year, we sourced merchandise through approximately 300 vendors located throughout the world, primarily in Asia, and did not source more than 10% of our merchandise from any single factory or supplier during the year. 

We maintain a quality control department at our distribution centers to inspect incoming merchandise shipments for overall quality of manufacturing. Periodic inspections are also made by our employees and agents at manufacturing facilities to identify quality issues prior to shipment of merchandise.

We uphold an extensive factory inspection program to monitor compliance with our Vendor Code of Conduct. New garment factories must pass an initial inspection in order to do business with us and we continue to review their social compliance performance both through internal audits by our compliance team and through the use of third-party monitors. We strive to partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilize best practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental practices and workplace safety. 

Inventory and Distribution

Merchandise is shipped directly from our vendors to our U.S. distribution centers in Hazelton, Pennsylvania and Ottawa, Kansas, or to our Canadian distribution center in Mississauga, Ontario. Additionally, an increasing amount of product is shipped directly to stores, by-passing our distribution centers which reduces transit times and lowers operating costs. We contract with third-party distribution centers in the Netherlands, Mexico City, Hong Kong and Shanghai. 

&#160;

We strive to mai ntain sufficient quantities of inventory in our retail stores and distribution centers to offer customers a full selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current. 

Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Competition

The retail apparel industry is highly competitive both in stores and on-line. We compete with various individual and chain specialty stores, as well as the casual apparel and footwear departments of department stores and discount retailers, primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection and price.

Trademarks and Service Marks

We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS &#174; , AMERICAN EAGLE &#174; , AE &#174; , AEO &#174; , LIVE YOUR LIFE &#174; , Aerie &#174; and the Flying Eagle Design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also have registered or have applied to register these trademarks with the registries of the foreign countries in which our stores and/or manufacturers are located and/or where our product is shipped. 

We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS &#174; , AMERICAN EAGLE &#174; , AEO &#174; , LIVE YOUR LIFE &#174; , Aerie &#174; and the Flying Eagle Design with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. In addition, we have acquired rights in AE TM for clothing products and registered AE &#174; in connection with certain non-clothing products. 

In the U.S. and in other countries around the world, we also have registered, or have applied to register, a number of other marks used in our business, including our pocket stitch designs.

These registered trademarks are renewable indefinitely, and their registrations are properly maintained in accordance with the laws of the country in which they are registered. We believe that the recognition associated with these trademarks makes them extremely valuable and, therefore, we intend to use and renew our trademarks in accordance with our business plans.
