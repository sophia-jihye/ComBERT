Business. 

WMIH Corp. 

WMIH Corp. (&#8220;WMIH&#8221;) is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. On May 11, 2015, WMIH merged with its parent corporation, WMI Holdings Corp. (&#8220;WMIHC&#8221;), a Washington corporation, with WMIH as the surviving corporation in the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). The Merger occurred as part of the reincorporation of WMIHC from the State of Washington to the State of Delaware effective May 11, 2015 (the &#8220;Reincorporation Date&#8221;).

WMIH, formerly known as WMIHC and Washington Mutual, Inc. (&#8220;WMI&#8221;), is the direct parent of WMMRC and WMIIC. Since emergence from bankruptcy on March 19, 2012 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), we have had limited operations other than WMMRC&#8217;s legacy reinsurance business, which is being operated in runoff mode. We continue to operate WMMRC&#8217;s business in runoff mode, and our primary strategic objective is to consummate one or more acquisitions of an operating business, either through a merger, purchase, business combination or other form of acquisition, and grow our business. Until such time as an acquisition is consummated, we intend to continue to seek, identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities of varying sizes across a broad array of industries for the purpose of facilitating an acquisition of one or more operating businesses. Our management team meets regularly with the Corporate Strategy and Development Committee (the &#8220;CS&#38;D Committee&#8221;) of WMIH&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221; or &#8220;Board of Directors&#8221;) to discuss and evaluate potential acquisition targets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the CS&#38;D Committee met formally and informally numerous times to assess various opportunities. In 2015 we have focused primarily on acquisition targets in the financial services industry, including targets with consumer finance, specialty finance, leasing and insurance operations. 

On January 5, 2015, WMIH announced the completion of an offering (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock Financing&#8221;) of 600,000 shares of its 3% Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001, liquidation preference $1,000 per share (the &#8220;Series B Preferred Stock&#8221;), in the amount of aggregate gross proceeds equal to $600.0 million, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and KKR Capital Markets LLC (&#8220;KCM &#8221;), an affiliate of KKR Fund Holdings L.P. and KKR Management Holdings L.P. (&#8220;KKR Management&#8221;). The net proceeds from the Series B Preferred Stock Financing in the amount of $598.5 million were deposited into an escrow account and invested in United States government securities having a maturity of 180 days or less, in certain money market funds, or cash items. The net proceeds of the Series B Preferred Stock Financing will be released from escrow to us from time to time in amounts needed to finance our efforts to explore and fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions, whether completed or not, including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, accounting expenses, due diligence and financial advisor fees and expenses. For further information on the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, see Note 9: Capital Stock, to the consolidated financial information in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, WMIH identified a potential acquisition opportunity and participated in a competitive sale process with respect to an operating division of a public company. However, we were not able to reach a definitive agreement for the transaction and discussions ceased on October 13, 2015. In connection with the foregoing, the Company expended time and resources to explore this potential acquisition, including the incurrence of approximately $11.1 million in fees and expenses for financial advisory, legal and consulting services. As permitted under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, the fees and costs associated with the exploration of this acquisition opportunity were paid for using a portion of the proceeds of the Series B Preferred Stock Financing. WMIH will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and work with our strategic partner, an affiliate of KKR &#38; CO. L.P. (together with its affiliates, &#8220;KKR&#8221;), to identify, consider and evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, business combinations and other strategic opportunities in a variety of industries. As of December 31, 2015, WMIH had not consummated an acquisition and we can provide no assurances that we will successfully consummate a transaction and, if so, on what terms.

&#160;

In connection with our stated objective to consummate one or more acquisitions of an operating business, we may explore various financing alternatives to fund our external growth strategy, including further improving our capital structure, which may include increasing, reducing and/or refinancing debt, pursuing capital raising activities, such as the issuance of new preferred or common equity and/or a rights offering to our existing stockholders, launching an exchange offer, and pursuing other transactions involving our outstanding securities. 

WMMRC 

WMMRC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH and a pure captive insurance company domiciled in the State of Hawaii, whose sole activity is the reinsurance of mortgage insurance policies. WMMRC was incorporated on February 25, 2000, and received a Certificate of Authority, dated March 2, 2000, from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. 

WMMRC was organized to reinsure private mortgage insurance risk for seven primary mortgage insurers on loans originated or purchased by certain former subsidiaries of WMI. The seven primary mortgage insurers are United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company (&#8220;UGRIC&#8221;), Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation (&#8220;GMIC&#8221;), Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (&#8220;MGIC&#8221;), PMI Mortgage Insurance Company (&#8220;PMI&#8221;), Radian Guaranty Incorporated (&#8220;Radian&#8221;), Republic Mortgage Insurance Company (&#8220;RMIC&#8221;) and Triad Guaranty Insurance Company (&#8220;Triad&#8221;). 

All of WMMRC&#8217;s reinsurance agreements are on an excess of loss basis, except for certain reinsurance treaties with GMIC and Radian during 2007 and 2008, which are reinsured on a 50% quota share basis. Pursuant to the excess of loss reinsurance agreements, WMMRC reinsures a second loss layer which ranges from 5% to 10% of the risk in force in excess of the primary mortgage insurer&#8217;s first loss percentages which range from 4% to 5%. Each calendar year, or book year, is treated separately from other years when calculating losses. In return for accepting a portion of the risk, WMMRC receives, net of ceding commission, a percentage of the premium that ranges from 25% to 40%. 

Beginning in 2006, the U.S. housing market and related credit markets experienced a multi-year downturn. During that period, housing prices declined materially, credit guidelines tightened, delays in mortgage servicing and foreclosure activities occurred, and deterioration in the credit performance of mortgage loans occurred. In addition, the macro-economic environment during that period demonstrated limited economic growth, stubbornly high unemployment, and limited median wage gains. Beginning in 2012, home prices began to rise again although they remain slightly below their 2006 peak. The outlook for the housing market is cautiously optimistic with relatively low interest rates, an improving jobs market, household formation rates and less restrictive credit conditions. Nevertheless, WMMRC&#8217;s operating environment remains uncertain as much of its results over the next several years will be directly affected by the inventory of pending defaulted mortgages at its ceding companies arising primarily from mortgages originated in calendar years 2005 through 2008. 

Due to the then deteriorating performance in the mortgage guarantee markets and the closure and receivership of Washington Mutual Bank (&#8220;WMB&#8221;), a former subsidiary of WMIH, the reinsurance agreements with each of the primary mortgage insurers were terminated or placed into runoff during 2008. As a result, effective September 26, 2008 (the &#8220;Petition Date&#8221;), WMMRC ceased assuming new mortgage risks from the primary carriers. Consequently, WMMRC&#8217;s continuing operations consisted solely of the runoff of coverage associated with mortgages placed with the primary mortgage carriers prior to September 26, 2008. In runoff, an insurer generally writes no new business but continues to service its obligations under in-force policies and otherwise continues as a licensed insurer. Management does not believe any additional adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities which were recorded at fair market value as a result of fresh start accounting as of March 19, 2012 are required as a result of WMMRC&#8217;s runoff status.

The reinsurance agreements with Triad, PMI and UGRIC were commuted (each, a one-time transaction) on August 31, 2009, October 2, 2012 and April 3, 2014, respectively. The PMI transaction resulted in a loss from contract termination of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. In accordance with the commutation agreement between WMMRC and PMI, the trust assets were distributed in a manner such that PMI received $49.0 million in cash and WMMRC received all remaining trust assets equal to approximately $30.7 million. The UGRIC transaction resulted in a loss from contract termination of $6.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. In accordance with the terms of the commutation agreement between WMMRC and UGRIC, the trust assets were distributed in a manner such that UGRIC was paid $17.7 million in cash and WMMRC was paid all remaining cash and assets remaining in the trust account, which totaled $65.4 million from the commutation. The proceeds from the PMI and UGRIC commutations were used to pay principal and interest and fees related to the Runoff Notes to the extent such proceeds were Runoff Proceeds as defined under the Indentures.

WMIIC 

WMIIC does not currently have any assets or operations and is fully eliminated upon consolidation. Prior to September 26, 2008, WMIIC held a variety of securities and investments; however, such securities and investments were liquidated and the value thereof distributed in connection with implementing the Company&#8217;s Seventh Amended Joint Plan of Affiliated Debtors Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (as modified, the &#8220;Plan&#8221;). 

Competition 

With respect to our current operations, the Company operates a single business, WMMRC, whose sole activity is the reinsurance of mortgage insurance policies. WMMRC has been operated in runoff mode since September 26, 2008. Since that date, WMMRC has not underwritten any new policies (and by extension any new risk). WMMRC, through predecessor companies, began reinsuring risks in 1997 and continued reinsuring risks through September 25, 2008. 

Because WMMRC&#8217;s business is in runoff mode, we currently have no competitors in that line of business. However, because we are pursuing an acquisition strategy and competition for acquisitions generally has increased, we will compete for acquisition opportunities and some of those potential competitors for such opportunities are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. We are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and there is no assurance that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us. 

Compliance with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new regulations enacted by the SEC, are resulting in increased compliance costs. In addition, during the bankruptcy, WMI relied on the so-called &#8220;Modified Exchange Act Reporting&#8221; concepts set forth in the SEC Staff&#8217;s Legal Bulletin No. 2

(&#8220;SLB 2&#8221;). WMIH continues to rely upon SLB 2, for our reporting during the bankruptcy period, and we have filed and will continue to file the Exchange Act periodic reports for all periods that begin after the Effective Date of the Plan. Compliance with different or evolving standards could result in increased general and administrative expenses and may cause a diversion of our time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and could subject WMIH to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed four full-time employees. We also have retained the services of two individuals on a non-exclusive basis to serve as executive officers of WMIH.
