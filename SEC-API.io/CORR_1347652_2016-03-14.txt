 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (&#8220;CorEnergy&#8221;) was organized as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on December 8, 2005. As used in this report, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to CorEnergy and its subsidiaries. Please refer to the Glossary of Defined Terms presented at the beginning of Part 1 for definitions of additional capitalized terms and abbreviations used in this report. Prior to 2011 we operated as a business development company under the name Tortoise Capital Resources Corporation and invested primarily in securities of privately held and micro-cap public companies operating in the U.S. energy sector. In April 2011, we withdrew our election to be treated as a business development company. We do not plan on making additional investments in securities (other than short-term, highly liquid investments to be held pending acquisition of real property assets) and intend to liquidate our legacy private securities investments in an orderly manner. We have elected REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with calendar year 2013. Our REIT election, assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests, will continue in effect for subsequent taxable years. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

CorEnergy primarily owns assets in the midstream and downstream U.S. energy sectors that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. Our objective is to provide shareholders with a stable and growing cash dividend, supported by long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases. These leases generate stable cash flows without direct commodity price exposure. We believe our leadership team&#8217;s energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent, investor-friendly REIT. We meet the capital needs of companies in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector because we are a passive, long-term partner using our management's extensive industry knowledge to customize our long-term leases and structured financings. Our leadership team also has extensive insight on the broad universe of assets that may be owned by a REIT and utilizes a disciplined investment philosophy developed through over 26 years of relevant industry experience. 

We expect our leases to provide us with contracted base rent, plus participating rent based upon asset-specific criteria. The energy industry commonly employs contracts with participating features, and we provide exposure to both the risk and opportunity of utilization of our assets, which we believe is a hallmark of infrastructure assets of all types. Our participating triple-net leases, and our participating mortgages, require the operator to pay all expenses of the business including maintaining our assets in good working order. 

Our assets are primarily mission-critical to our customers, in that utilization of our assets is necessary for the business they seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. For example, our crude oil gathering system assets are necessary to the exploration of upstream crude oil reserves, so the operators' lease of those assets is economically critical to their operations. Some of our assets are subject to rate regulation by FERC or state public utility commissions. In most cases, we believe our assets are essential to the conduct of the business of our customers. Further, energy infrastructure assets are an essential and growing component of the U.S. economy that give us the opportunity to assist the capital expansion plans and meet the capital needs of various midstream and upstream participants. 

We intend to distribute substantially all of our cash available for distribution, less prudent reserves, on a quarterly basis. CorEnergy has historically targeted dividend growth of 1-3% annually from existing contracts through inflation escalations and participating rents. The Company is not expecting significant inflation-based or participating rents in 2016. Since qualifying as a REIT in 2013, we have grown our annualized dividend from $2.50 per share to $3.00 per share in 2015. Our management contract includes incentive provisions, aligning our leadership team with our stockholders' interests in raising the dividend only if we believe the rate is sustainable.

Energy Infrastructure Financing Investments 

We have provided financing loans to owners and operators of energy infrastructure real property assets, secured by such assets and related equipment, as well as by the outstanding equity of the borrowers. These loans include participating features pursuant to which we may receive additional interest tied to increases in utilization of the underlying facilities, and one also includes an equity enhancement. See the section titled "Asset Portfolio and Related Developments" in Item 7 and Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in this report for additional information concerning these investments. 

Private Equity Investments 

Our legacy private equity investments generally have been liquidated in accordance with the plans of those entities. For additional information, see &#8220;Private Security Assets&#8221; under Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this Form 10-K. 

Acquisition Strategies and Due Diligence 

We generally rely on our own analysis to determine whether to make an acquisition. In evaluating net lease transactions, we generally consider, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction: 

&#8226; 

Tenant/Borrower Evaluation &#32;- We evaluate each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as well as other factors that may be relevant to a particular acquisition. We seek opportunities in which we believe the tenant may have a stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been recognized by the market. In evaluating a possible investment, the creditworthiness of a tenant or borrower often will be balanced with the value of the underlying real estate, particularly if the underlying property is specifically suited to the needs of the tenant. Whether a prospective tenant or borrower is creditworthy will be determined by our management team and reviewed by the investment committee, as described below. Creditworthy does not necessarily mean &#8220;investment grade.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Important to Tenant/Borrower Operations - We generally will focus on properties that we believe are essential or important to the ongoing operations of the tenant. We believe that this type of property will provide a relatively low risk of loss in the case of a potential bankruptcy or abandonment scenario since a tenant/borrower is less likely to risk the loss of a critically important lease or property. Additionally we focus on assets which are necessary for the economic production of hydrocarbon resources, and which would remain necessary to any owner of the assets. 

&#8226; 

Diversification - We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, and geographic location within the U.S. or tenant/borrower industry. By diversifying, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular asset or geographic region within the U.S. 

&#8226; 

Lease Terms - Generally, the net leased properties we will acquire will be leased on a full recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, we generally will seek to include a clause in each lease that provides for increases in rent over the term of the lease. These increases are fixed or tied generally to increases in indices such as the CPI. The lease will also generally seek to provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant at the property, thereby providing exposure to the commercial activity of the tenant, and providing the tenant some flexibility in lease terms. Alternatively, a lease may provide for mandated rental increases on specific dates, and we may adopt other methods in the future. 

&#8226; 

Asset Evaluation - We review the physical condition of the property and assess the likelihood of replacing the rental payment stream if the tenant defaults. We also generally engage a third party to conduct, or require the seller to conduct a preliminary examination, or Phase 1 assessment, of the site to determine the potential for contamination or similar environmental site assessments in an attempt to identify potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition. 

&#32; 

Index to Financial Statements 

Glossary of Defined Terms 

&#8226; 

Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value - We attempt to include provisions in the leases that we believe may help protect a real property asset from changes in the operating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may affect its ability to satisfy its obligations or reduce the value of the real property asset. Such provisions include requiring our consent to specified tenant activity, requiring the tenant to provide indemnification protections, and requiring the tenant to utilize good operating practices consistent with objective criteria. We seek to enhance the likelihood of a tenant&#8217;s lease obligations being satisfied through a guaranty of obligations from the tenant&#8217;s corporate parent or other entity or a letter of credit. In addition, in some circumstances, tenants may retain the right to repurchase the leased property. We expect, in those situations that the option purchase price will generally be the greater of the contract purchase price or the fair market value of the property at the time the option is exercised. 

&#8226; 

Equity Enhancements - We may attempt to obtain equity enhancements in connection with transactions. These equity enhancements may involve warrants exercisable at a future time to purchase stock of the tenant or borrower or their parent. If warrants are obtained, and become exercisable, and if the value of the stock subsequently exceeds the exercise price of the warrant, equity enhancements can help achieve the goal of increasing investor returns. 

&#8226; 

Other Real Estate Related Assets - As other opportunities arise, we may also seek to expand the portfolio to include other types of real estate-related investments, in all cases within the energy infrastructure sector, such as: 

&#8226; 

equity investments in real properties that are not long-term net leased to a single-tenant and may include partially leased properties, undeveloped properties and properties subject to short-term net leases, among others; 

&#8226; 

mortgage loans secured by real properties including loans to our taxable REIT subsidiaries; 

&#8226; 

subordinated interests in first mortgage real estate loans, or B-notes; 

&#8226; 

mezzanine loans related to real estate, which are senior to the borrower&#8217;s equity position but subordinated to other third-party financing; and 

&#8226; 

equity and debt securities (including preferred equity, limited partnership interests, trusts and other higher-yielding structured debt and equity investments) issued by companies that are engaged in real-estate-related businesses as defined by regulations promulgated under the Code, including other REITs. 

Use of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries 

We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived through leasing fees and financing revenue from our REIT qualifying investment in energy infrastructure assets. However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). The use of TRSs enables us to own certain assets and engage in certain businesses while maintaining compliance with the REIT qualification requirements under the Code. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;QRSs&#8221;), and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including QRSs. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

Our energy infrastructure assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of public health and safety, zoning and land use, and pricing and other matters related to certain of our business operations. For a discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts of such regulations on our business and properties, see the discussion presented in Item 1A of this report under the subheading &#8220;Risks Related to Our Investments in Real Estate and the U.S. Energy Infrastructure Sector." In particular, for a discussion of the current and potential future effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, see the discussion titled " Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution &#8221; within such section. 

Financing Strategies 

Consistent with our asset acquisition policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. The amount of leverage that we may employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Although we currently do not anticipate doing so, the amount of total funded debt leverage we employ may exceed 50 percent of our total assets. Secured loans which we obtain, could be recourse or non-recourse to us. A lender on non-recourse mortgage debt generally has recourse only to the property collateralizing such debt and not to any of our other assets, while full recourse financing would give the lender recourse to all of our assets. The use of non-recourse debt, helps us to limit the exposure of all of our assets to any one debt obligation. Lenders may, however, have recourse to our other assets in limited circumstances 

&#32;

Glossary of Defined Terms 

not related to the repayment of the indebtedness, such as under an environmental indemnity. We may have an unsecured line of credit that can be used in connection with refinancing existing debt and making new acquisitions, as well as to meet other working capital needs. We intend to incur debt which bears interest at fixed rates, or is effectively converted to fixed rates through interest rate caps or swap agreements. 

Competition 

We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial financing companies to make the types of investments that we plan to make in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources than are available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. These competitive conditions may adversely affect our ability to make investments in the energy infrastructure sector and could adversely affect our distributions to stockholders. 

RECENT TRANSACTIONS 

Acquisitions 

Grand Isle Gathering System. On June 30, 2015, utilizing proceeds from the financing activities described below, we acquired the Grand Isle Gathering System, a subsea, crude oil pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico. For a further description of the GIGS assets and related information, see Item 2 - Properties, the section titled "Asset Portfolio and Related Developments" in Item 7, and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, included in this report. 

Investment Transactions 

Liquidation of Investment in EIP . On April 1, 2015, upon lease termination, we sold our 40 percent undivided interest in the Eastern Interconnect Project (EIP) to the tenant, Public Service Company of New Mexico. Proceeds from the sale totaled approximately $7.7 million. See the section titled "Asset Portfolio and Related Developments" in Item 7 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information concerning this transaction. 

Financing Transactions 

Preferred Stock Offering . On January 27, 2015, we completed a registered public offering of 2,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/100th of a share of the Company&#8217;s 7.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and, on February 5, 2015, we sold an additional 250,000 depositary shares pursuant to the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option. We used the net proceeds from this offering (approximately $54.5 million after underwriting discount) to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Regions Revolver and for general corporate purposes. 

Common Stock Offering . On June 23, 2015, we completed a follow-on equity offering of 2,587,500 shares of common stock that generated $73.3 million in proceeds net of underwriting discounts, which were used in the acquisition of GIGS as discussed above. 

Convertible Debt Offering . On June 23, 2015 we completed a new issue of convertible debt in an underwritten public offering that generated $111.3 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, which were used in the acquisition of GIGS as discussed above. 

Regions Credit Facility. &#32;&#32;On July 8, 2015, the Company amended and upsized its existing $93 million credit facility with Regions Bank (as lender and administrative agent for the other participating lenders) to provide borrowing commitments of $153 million, consisting of (i) an increase in the Regions Revolver to $105 million, (ii) the existing $3 million MoGas revolver at the subsidiary entity level and (iii) a $45 million term loan at the CorEnergy parent entity level (the "Regions Term Loan" and, collectively with the upsized Regions Revolver and the MoGas Revolver, the "Regions Credit Facility"). Upon closing the Regions Credit Facility, CorEnergy drew $45 million on the Regions Term Loan at the parent level to pay down the balance on the Regions Revolver that had been used in funding the GIGS acquisition, referenced above. The Company now has approximately $95.8 million &#32;of available borrowing capacity on the Regions Revolver. 

Pinedale Credit Facility. &#32;&#32;On December 31, 2015, our subsidiary, Pinedale Corridor LP, extended its current secured credit facility with KeyBank National Association through March 2016. With the execution of the agreement, a principal reduction payment of $1.0 million was made, resulting in an outstanding balance of approximately $62.5 million. Through the extension period, Pinedale Corridor LP will make revised monthly principal payments, totaling approximately $4.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at the LIBOR rate plus 4.25 percent.

MANAGEMENT 

Our Manager 

We are externally managed by Corridor. Corridor is a real property asset manager with a focus on U.S. energy infrastructure real property assets. Corridor assists us in identifying infrastructure real property assets that can be leased to businesses that make goods, provide services or own assets other than securities, and is generally responsible for our day-to-day operations. 

Corridor Team 

Each of our officers is an employee of Corridor or one of its affiliates. Corridor is not obligated to dedicate certain of its employees exclusively to us, nor are it or its employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to our business. As described below, we pay a management fee and certain other fees to Corridor, which it uses in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who, notwithstanding that some of them also are our officers, receive no cash compensation directly from us. 

We pay Corridor a management fee based on total assets under management. In aligning our strategy to focus on distributions and distribution growth, Corridor is paid an incentive fee based on increases in distributions to our stockholders. A percentage of the Corridor incentive fee is reinvested in CorEnergy's common stock. Pursuant to a Management Agreement and an Administrative Agreement, Corridor has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to present us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment objectives and policies and is generally responsible, subject to the supervision and review of our Board of Directors, for our day-to-day operations. 

Energy Infrastructure Real Property Asset Management 

The Corridor team has experience across several segments of the energy sector and is primarily responsible for investigating, analyzing and selecting potential infrastructure asset acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions and transactions are submitted to our Board of Directors for final approval following a recommendation from the management team. 

We believe that effective management of our assets is essential to maintain and enhance property values. Important aspects of asset management include restructuring transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, refinancing debt, selling properties and knowledge of the bankruptcy process. 

We monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our properties. Monitoring involves receiving assurances that each tenant has paid real estate taxes, assessments and other expenses relating to the properties it occupies and confirming that appropriate insurance coverage is being maintained by the tenant. We review financial statements of tenants and undertake regular physical inspections of the condition and maintenance of properties. In addition, we periodically analyze each tenant&#8217;s financial condition and the industry in which each tenant operates. 

Private Investment Monitoring 

We monitor our private investments to determine progress relative to meeting the Company&#8217;s business plan and to assess the Company&#8217;s strategic and tactical courses of action. This monitoring is accomplished by attendance at Board of Directors meetings, ad hoc communications with portfolio company management, the review of periodic operating and financial reports, an analysis of relevant reserve information and capital expenditure plans, and periodic consultations with engineers, geologists, and other experts. The performance of each private portfolio company is also periodically compared to performance of similarly sized companies with comparable assets and businesses to assess performance relative to peers. Corridor&#8217;s monitoring activities are expected to provide us with information that will enable us to monitor compliance with existing covenants. 

Management Agreement 

Under our Management Agreement, Corridor (i) presents the Company with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, (ii) is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, and (iii) performs such services and activities relating to the assets and operations of the Company as may be appropriate. The Management Agreement does not have a specific term, and will remain in place unless terminated by the Company or the Manager in the manner permitted pursuant to the agreement. 

The terms of the Management Agreement include a quarterly management fee equal to 0.25 percent (1.00 percent annualized) of the value of the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter. For purposes of the Management Agreement, &#8220;Managed Assets&#8221; means the total assets of the Company (including any securities receivables, other personal property or real property purchased with or attributable to any borrowed funds) minus (A) the initial invested value of all non-controlling interests, (B) the value of any hedged derivative assets, (C) any prepaid expenses, and (D) all of the accrued liabilities other than (1) deferred taxes 

&#32;

Glossary of Defined Terms 

and (2) debt entered into for the purpose of leverage. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, the Company&#8217;s securities portfolio will be valued at then-current market value. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, other personal property and real property assets will include real and other personal property owned and the assets of the Company invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate or personal property (including acquisition related costs and acquisition costs that may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), valued at the aggregate historical cost, before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar noncash reserves. 

The Management Agreement includes a quarterly incentive fee of 10 percent of the increase in distributions paid over a threshold distribution equal to $0.625 per share per quarter. The Management Agreement also requires at least half of any incentive fees to be reinvested in the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, and the first quarter of 2016, the Company and the Manager agreed to the following modifications to the fee arrangements described above: 

&#8226; 

in order to ensure equitable application of the quarterly management fee provisions of the Management Agreement to the GIGS acquisition, which closed on June 30, 2015, the Manager waived any incremental management fee due as of the end of the second quarter of 2015 based on the net impact of the GIGS Acquisition as of June 30, 2015; 

&#8226; 

in light of the Provision for Loan Loss recorded with respect to the Black Bison Loans as described in Note 6 in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in this report, the Manager voluntarily recommended, and the Company agreed, that effective on and after September 30, 2015, solely for the purpose of computing the value of the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets in calculating the quarterly management fee described above, the Company&#8217;s investment in the Black Bison Loans and the Black Bison Warrant will be valued based on their estimated net realizable value (which shall not exceed the amount of the Company&#8217;s initial investment) as of the end of the quarter for which the Management Fee is to be calculated; and 

&#8226; 

in light of the provision for uncollectable interest recorded with respect to Black Bison loans as described in Note 6 in the Notes to Financial Statements included in this report, the Manager voluntarily recommended, and the Company agreed, that the Manager would waive $133,194 of the total $278,619 incentive fee that would otherwise be payable under the provisions described above with respect to dividends paid on the Company&#8217;s common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015, and accordingly the Manager received an incentive fee of $145,425 for such period. 

Administrative Agreement 

Under our Administrative Agreement, Corridor, as our administrator, performs (or oversees or arranges for the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including without limitation providing us with equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. For these services we pay our administrator a fee equal to 0.04 percent of our aggregate average daily Managed Assets, with a minimum annual fee of $30 thousand. 

Pursuant to the Management and Administrative Agreements, Corridor furnishes us with office facilities and clerical and administrative services necessary for our operation (other than services provided by our custodian, accounting agent, administrator, dividend and interest paying agent and other service providers). Corridor is authorized to enter into agreements with third parties to provide such services. To the extent we request, Corridor will (i) oversee the performance and payment of the fees of our service providers and make such reports and recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning such matters as the parties deem desirable, (ii) respond to inquiries and otherwise assist such service providers in the preparation and filing of regulatory reports, proxy statements, and stockholder communications, and the preparation of materials and reports for the Board of Directors; (iii) establish and oversee the implementation of borrowing facilities or other forms of leverage authorized by the Board of Directors and (iv) supervise any other aspect of our administration as may be agreed upon by us and Corridor. We have agreed, pursuant to the Management Agreement, to reimburse Corridor for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the foregoing. 

We bear all expenses not specifically assumed by Corridor and incurred in our operations. The compensation and allocable routine overhead expenses of all management professionals of Corridor and its staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing us management services, is provided and paid for by Corridor and not us. 

Employees 

As we are externally managed, we have no employees at the corporate level. Our subsidiary, Omega, has one part-time and four full-time employees. Our subsidiary MoGas has 17 full-time employees.
