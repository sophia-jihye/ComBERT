&#160; 

&#8226; Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc., an active Nevada corporation (Parent) 

&#160; 

&#8226; Rocky Mountain High Clothing Company, Inc., an inactive Texas Corporation (Subsidiary) &#160; 

&#8226; Smarterita, LLC, an inactive Texas limited liability company (Subsidiary) &#160; 

&#8226; Rocky Mountain High Water Company, LLC (unconsolidated Subsidiary) &#160;

RMHB is a consumer goods brand development company specializing in developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing high quality, health conscious, hemp-infused food and beverage products and spring water. The Company currently markets a lineup of five hemp-infused beverages. RMHB is also researching the development of a lineup of products containing Cannabidiol (CBD). The Company&#8217;s intention is to be on the cutting edge of the use of CBD in consumer products while complying with all state and federal laws and regulations. See New Product Pipeline below. 

After developing the beverage products, RMHB completed its first production run in February of 2015. Since then RMHB has had production runs for hemp-infused beverages totaling over 3,700,000 cans. Each beverage contains approximately 100mg of hempseed extract, and all of the non-alcoholic beverages will consist of all-natural ingredients. The non-alcoholic products are shelf stable (no refrigeration necessary) with a shelf life of two (2) years. The Wine Based Ready-to-Drink Cocktails contain 12.5% alcohol and are packaged in 375ml, 750ml and 1.5 liter PET bottles. These alcoholic beverages are also shelf stable (no refrigeration necessary) and have a shelf life of 18 months. Packaging for our line-up of products containing cannabinoids (CBD) will be determined at a later date. 

&#160; 

The Company has also run its first production run of both Energy Shots and Relaxation Brownies. In addition, in August, the Company bottled his first high alkaline spring water. 

&#160; 

Business Development in the Last Three Years 

&#160; 

The Company is a C corporation, and was incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2000. 

&#160; 

Over the past three years, the Company developed as follows: 

&#160; 

In May 2011, the Company changed its name from Precious Metals Exchange Corp. to Legends Food Company, with a business plan of selling quick frozen barbecue over the internet to consumers and engaging celebrities to help sell the product, thus the Legends name. The Company started development of a web-site with a shopping cart to accommodate sales. Prior to launching, the Company modified its strategy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In November, 2011, the Company was able to trademark the name &#8220;Republic of Texas Brands, and shifted its operations from the frozen barbecue over the internet to sales of Texas based products over the internet, utilizing an updated version of the shopping cart that was developed as a part of the Legends Foods website. The Company operated the website during the first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 and generated approximately $100,000 in sales during that time period. 

&#160; 

When the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Marketing Officer resigned from the Company, remaining management changed strategies and focused on acquisition of a barbecue restaurant chain with twelve operating restaurants. The Company entered into a Letter of Intent to purchase the restaurant chain, but was unable to close the transaction due to its inability to raise sufficient capital. 

&#160; 

The development of the business over the past three years has been interrupted by a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, from which the Company successfully emerged on July 11, 2014 with a confirmed Plan of Reorganization (&#8220;Plan&#8221;) by order of United States Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser. The bankruptcy proceeding is more fully set forth hereinafter under the section entitled Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings. In early 2013, the Company had sought to purchase a barbeque chain located in the Dallas, Texas area, but was ultimately unable to secure financing and was sued by the party with whom the Company had contracted to arrange and secure the financing. The Company filed a Voluntary Petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. During the bankruptcy proceeding, the Company determined that a new business model would provide the best opportunity to grow the Company. The Company entered into a newly emerging sector of hemp-infused beverages. The Plan called for the acquisition by the Company of Chill Texas, a business with distribution rights to Chillo, a hemp-infused energy drink. 

&#160; 

In August, 2014, the Company made a decision to develop its own line of hemp-infused beverages, and followed through by creating formulas, logos, trademarks and conducting the requisite market research to determine the viability of such a lineup of hemp-infused drinks. During this developmental phase of the Company as a hemp-infused beverage business, the Company was successful in trademarking the name Rocky Mountain High for its drinks. 

&#160; 

In early 2015, the Company scheduled its first production run of drink products and in February, 2015 completed its first production run. Since that first production run in its Minnesota co-packing facility, the Company has produced nearly 4,000,000 cans of hemp-infused beverages in its first year in the hemp-infused beverage business. The Company had established a distribution network for the distribution of its products and continues to pursue distributor affiliations in order to place its drinks in national retail chains. 

&#160; 

The only purchase and sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business was the purchase of assets from Dollar Shots Club, LLC and subsequent sale of those assets to Dollar Shots Club, Inc. A more detailed description of those transactions are set forth on page 4 under Acquisition Agreements. 

&#160; 

During 2015 the Company acquired all of the interests in Smarterita, LLC for 4,500,000 shares of restricted Rule 144 common stock of the Company. 

&#160; 

In the past three years, the Company changed its corporate name from Republic of Texas Brands, Inc. (RTXB) to Totally Hemp Crazy, Inc. (THCZ) and then to the current name of Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (RMHB).

Acquisition Agreements 

&#160; 

On March 31, 2015 the Company acquired 100% of the ownership interests of Smarterita, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company from Vintage Specialists, LLC and Thomas Shuman, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Smarterita, LLC owned certain inventory defined in the agreement and the trade name &#34;Smarterita&#34;. Consideration for the acquisition was 3,000,000 restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to the owners of Vintage Specialists, LLC for 66% of Smarterita, LLC and$1,500 in cash to Thomas Shuman for his 34% of Smarterita, LLC. Prior to the series of transactions that effected the acquisition, Mr. Shuman owned 17% of Smarterita, LLC. He acquired an additional 17% from Michael Martin, who was issued 1,500,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s restricted common stock as consideration for delivery of the interests to Mr. Shuman and ultimately the Company. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805 &#34;Business Combinations&#34;. The total purchase price for the acquisition was allocated to the net tangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as set forth below. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets assumed at the acquisition date. 

&#160; 

Inventory $ 39,142 Goodwill $1,024,358 Total Consideration $1,063,500 &#160; 

The Company initially considered entering into the markets served by Smarterita, LLC, but decided to refocus its efforts on other business opportunities. As of June 30, 2015, the full amount of goodwill acquired has been impaired. Smarterita, LLC did not have any revenues prior to the acquisition and minimal operating expenses. 

&#160; 

On July 17, 2015, the Company acquired all of the assets of Dollar Shots Club, LLC. The purpose of the acquisition was to acquire formulas developed by Dollar Shots Club, LLC for inclusion in the Company&#8217;s hemp-based energy shots which were being developed at the time. 

&#160; 

The Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to seven individuals who owned 100% of membership units in Dollar Shots Club, LLC. The investment in Dollar Shots Club, LLC was recorded on the Company&#8217;s books at a price of $166,000, which was based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the day the stock was issued. The assets purchased included the trademark and other intellectual property of the LLC, inventory, all websites and ecommerce sites, goodwill, formulas and all other general intangibles (the &#8220;assets&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On September 18, 2015, the Company sold these assets to Dollar Shots Club, Inc. in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of Dollar Shots Club, Inc. common stock. The Company retained the rights to the formulas to the shots so that it could develop a similar hemp-infused energy version of them to be sold under Rocky Mountain High Brands. To the best of the Company&#8217;s knowledge, there is no relationship between the Dollar Shots Club entities.

MBA Beverage also purchases all ingredients that are used in the manufacturing process since it has established relationships with all suppliers. MBA Beverage purchases hemp from Global Essence, Global Essence provides MBA Beverage independent third party testing documentation that all hemp used in our manufacturing process is THC free. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Blues City Brewery, LLC (&#8220;Blues City&#8221;) in Memphis, Tennessee, a subsidiary of City Brewing Company, LLC, manufactures and bottles our products. Blues City is an FDA registered facility that is audited annually to ensure compliance with FDA GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) for food safety. MBA Beverage schedules beverage production with Blues City. The Company does not contract with Blues City directly. A copy of the MBA Beverage contract is included as an exhibit to this filing. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Sovereign Flavors of Santa Ana, California collaborates with the Company for product formulation under an oral agreement. The Company owns the propriety formulas to our products. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Upstart Foods Marketing of St. Louis, Missouri and Advertising Arts of Brookfield, Wisconsin provide the packaging design. Once any packing design (label) is approved, Ball Metal Beverage Container Corporation or Rexam Beverage Can Company manufactures the cans. Upon completion, the cans are shipped to Blues City. Payments are made in advance to MBA Beverage. MBA Beverage, in turn, makes payments in advance at both manufacturing plants. There are no written contracts, other than with MBA Beverage and Upstart Food Marketing &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Upon completion of the production, the Company stores finished product at Blues City, awaiting sale to our distributor network. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Product is sold to distributors under a variety of terms from cash upfront to credit terms. Additionally, the Company sells through various online outlets. &#160;

Wine Based Ready-to-Drink Cocktails 

The wine based ready-to-drink cocktails are still in pre-development stage. One flavor is SmarteRita Gold, a low-calorie drink with natural flavors that tastes like a margarita. The Company owns the formula to Smarterita Gold and is targeting third quarter of fiscal year 2017 to market it. We plan to generate revenue from its sales by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

Cannabinoid &#8220;CBD&#8221;- infused Beverages 

The CBD beverage line is in pre-development stage. Any CBD beverages will be THC-free. Therefore, these products will be 100% legal in all 50 states. Products containing Cannabidiol (CBD) can be a source of essential fatty acids, vitamin E, and trace minerals in addition to containing high amounts of protein. CBD is extracted and separated from specific varieties of cannabis, often known as hemp. Chemically, CBD is one of 85 chemical substances known as cannabinoids, which are all found in the cannabis plant. CBD is the second most abundant compound in hemp, typically representing up to 40% of its extracts. CBD is actually unrelated to the chemical chain that results in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They share some characteristics but are created via different paths. The chemical properties of CBD and THC vary widely enough to classify THC as a psychotropic drug strictly controlled by federal authorities, while CBD is considered a legal dietary supplement. 

&#160; 

The Company will seek an independent legal opinion to ensure that it remains in compliance with the Controlled Substances Act prior to marketing any products containing CBDs. Both plans are contingent upon appropriate legal vetting. 

&#160; 

Hemp-infused Energy Shots 

Hemp-infused energy shots have been developed and are ready to bottle. Energy shots are a unique form of energy drink. Usually, they are sold in 2-oz containers, whereas most energy drinks are sold in larger cans or bottles. Energy shots can be considered concentrated forms of energy drinks. The leading energy shot brand in the United States is 5-Hour Energy, based on sales of about $1.05 billion in 2015 . The Company is targeting first quarter of fiscal year 2017 to market it. We plan to generate revenue from its sales by the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

Hemp Protein Bars and Hemp Chia Seed Bars 

Hemp Protein Bars and Hemp Chia Seed Bars are in pre-development stage. Ingredients are projected to include: honey, butter, rice protein, oats, coconut, almonds, hemp proteins, brown rice, vanilla bean, sea salt, and in one variety, chia seeds. The chia seed is calorie sparse and nutrient dense, and contains anti-oxidants and other essential nutrients. It also contains protein, and a range of essential and non-essential amino acids and fiber. 

The Company is targeting second quarter of fiscal year 2017 to market it. We plan to generate revenue from its sales by the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

Hemp-infused Natural Spring Water 

Adding hemp-infused natural spring water to our beverage line is in pre-development stage. The Company is currently negotiating an agreement for access to natural spring water. If successful, the Company plans to bottle the water, market and sell it in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Revenue generation should commence in the same quarter. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The production of beverages and other related products &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The preparation and sale of beverages &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Environmental protection &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Interstate commerce and taxation laws &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Working and safety conditions, minimum wage and other labor requirements &#160; 

Since our hemp-based products are derived from industrial hemp and are THC free, they are not subject to the Controlled Substances Act. The express language of the federal Controlled Substances Act (&#34;CSA&#34;) provides that hemp stalk, fiber, oil and sterilized seed are not controlled as marijuana. Thus products containing industrial hemp &#8211; defined as the cannabis sativa plant containing a tetrahydrocannabinol (&#8220;THC&#8221;) level of 0.3% or less - have been sold legally in every state in the U.S. for decades. In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals invalidated U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) regulations that would have banned the manufacture and sale of edible products made from hemp seed and oil. Hemp Industries Ass&#8217;n v . Drug Enforcement Administration, 357 F.2d 1012 (9 th Cir. 2004). For this reason, U.S. companies may import hemp stalk, fiber, seed and oil, to trade in it, and to use it in the manufacture of products. The Company purchases imported hemp seed extract and uses it in the manufacture of its products. The Company does not have plans to grow marijuana, distribute marijuana or infuse our beverages with marijuana, as defined in the Controlled Substance Act. 

&#160; 

Our beverage products are not subject to direct FDA approval as the FDA does not perform review testing or approval of food, beverages or dietary supplements. The FDA requires that we manufacture our products in commercial manufacturing facilities that are annually audited to ensure that they pass inspection based on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for food safety. 

&#160; 

Possession of hemp in the United States is legal, including possession of the sterilized seed, hemp seed oil, hemp seed flour, hemp seed cake, hulled hemp seeds, hemp clothing, hemp fabrics, hemp fuel or any other product made from industrial hemp. Because the industrial hemp plant is the same species as marijuana, until recently, it has been illegal for U.S. farmers to grow the plant itself. However, in the federal Agricultural Act of 2014, Congress specifically exempted from the CSA cultivation of industrial hemp under agricultural pilot programs authorized by state law. 

&#160; 

More recently, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2016 (the &#34;Omnibus Law&#34;) clarified that during the current fiscal year - that ends on September 30, 2016 -- no agency can expand any monies that were authorized by federal law to interfere with duly registered agricultural pilot programs. The Omnibus Law also clarifies that this prohibition on federal interference extends pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill. 

&#160; 

Sales Channels 

&#160; 

The Company depends upon a network of brokers and distributors to represent its product in the market. During its first year of operation, the Company signed twenty four distributors across the country. For the year ending June 30, 2016, the Company&#8217;s two largest distributors accounted for 28% and 26% of sales, respectively. The Company is currently evaluating the performance of its brokers and distributors and restructuring its agreements and methods of distribution to support our future growth. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The various distribution channels differ in costs, customer relationships, complexity and the resources required to operate the channel. We strategically build sales distribution channels to match and reinforce the goals and objectives of our marketing plan. To increase competitiveness and sales, we have a specific sales strategy in order to maximize revenues that includes the following: 

&#160; 

Direct Selling 

We utilize direct sales to retailers which eliminates the delays and additional expense of a standard distribution channel. In this way we are better able to preserve more revenue, and protect capital under the control of the company. Direct selling to certain segments supports our marketing plan that has identified, researched and segmented certain final customers. 

&#160; 

Historically, our only outlet for direct selling has been two different online sales platforms and has accounted for approximately 7% of our sales. 

&#160; 

Wholesale 

Another sales channel includes wholesale distribution. This choice is designed for our potential customers who are widely dispersed. Wholesale distribution leaves the selling to wholesalers and retailers specialized in retail sales, which enables us to focus on manufacturing needs. 

&#160; 

Beverage Broker 

Our beverage brokers develop local, regional, and national product campaigns with attention to long-term sustainable success. They assist in matching brands with the needs of an evolving market. Scheduling appointments, making presentations, securing product approval, and shelf resets, have added greatly to the time line from ship to shelf, making the role of the beverage broker all the more important. Beverage brokers represent a cost-efficient method of doing business for our drink brands. A commission-based beverage broker is a variable cost directly tied to the volume sold. 

&#160; 

We have recently entered into an agreement with Function Beverage LLC, which is included as an Exhibit to this filing. In Exhibit A of the agreement, Function Brands has identified a number of national chains to whom they will represent our product. 

&#160; 

Historically, sales under this sales channel have been zero. Since the Company recently entered into an agreement with Function Beverage, we anticipate that this will become a significant sales channel for our products. 

&#160; 

Beverage Broker/Distributor 

The broker/distributor relationship adds credibility for new brands entering the market. Sales efforts consist of procuring new channels of distribution and distributor support. Beverage brokers/distributors provide a service to both RMHB and customers by selling to chain wholesalers, independent wholesalers, and retail stores. Beverage brokers and distributors often provide avenues to significantly decrease overhead costs. Wholesalers and retailers also benefit by working with one broker/distributor rather than with many manufacturers' representatives. Historically, 85% of our sales fall into this category. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Packaged Food and Beverage Market 

&#160; 

Our hemp-infused products (both non-alcoholic and alcoholic) are targeted toward health conscious lifestyle persons 16 to 34 years of age. 

&#160; 

Methods &#38; Competitive Position &#8211; Advantages &#38; Disadvantages 

&#160; 

The Company competes with start-ups and middle market CPG manufacturers and distributions that specialize in brand development. RMHB also competes with established brands and large multi-national firms that manage established brand portfolios. Consumer packaged goods (CPG) are a type of goods consumed that need to be replaced frequently, compared to those that are usable for extended periods of time. 

&#160; 

While there is certainly a lot of competition in the beverage industry, there are also great opportunities. The beverage market also includes hemp-infused energy drinks, teas, lemonades, and wine based cocktails. 

&#160; 

Advantages: 

&#160; 

We are achieving our competitive advantage by concentrating on two major objectives: Establish the corporate brand, and engage target audiences by building a consumer brand for loyalty and awareness. 

&#160; 

To establish Rocky Mountain High Brands as an industry leader, the corporate logo was redesigned to align itself with product identity that focuses on the overall company message. Rocky Mountain High Brands will engage brand identity by focusing on the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Differentiation &#160; 

Differentiation is a strategy used to set ourselves apart from competitors. One of our best marketable attributes is our Rocky Mountain High name. It differentiates us from other beverage drinks by developing brand recognition and loyalty. Our drinks provide an alternative to competitor&#8217;s drinks. Our can design helps the brand stand out on the shelf. Our eye-catching drink designs communicates the brand's attributes. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Cost Leadership 

&#160; 

We achieve cost leadership as an advantage when we offer a better quality product than our competitors at a lower price. We identify opportunities to produce goods at a lower cost through the production improvements and by changes to our supply chain. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Defensive Strategies 

&#160; 

Broker/distributor/wholesale relationships allow us to maintain higher levels of customer service than larger beverage companies, provide direct knowledge of our customers, and help us to provide our customers a more personalized consumer experience. 

&#160; 

Disadvantages: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Buying Power &#160; 

Large beverage companies typically can negotiate favorable costs with suppliers because of their volume, therefore we strategically plan opportunities to leverage our budget dollars. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Budgets &#160; 

The most glaring disadvantage is a limited budget. We would like to have more money to spend on advertising and promotion, hiring experienced consumer products sales professionals, training, marketing and product development. Competing for target market attention against larger competitors that invest millions or billions is difficult. These companies can invest significant resources to maintain their positions in the market, and their drinks are well integrated into their consumer branding. We plan to position our brand to take significant market share with strategic marketing, and consistent branding that maximizes brand exposure and awareness to the consumer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Future Goals 

&#160; 

The hemp-infused beverages are fully developed and in the marketplace today. Hemp Energy Bars, Hemp Protein Bars, and Hemp Chia Crisp Bars are developed and ready for production. Hemp Energy Shots are developed and ready for production. Hemp-infused alcoholic beverages and CBD products are in varying stages of research and development. 

&#160; 

Employees and Independent Contractors 

&#160; 

Periodically, the Company may hire independent contractors to support finance, accounting, and operations functions. In addition to the officers of the Company there are currently five non-officer employees. The Company has a total of ten employees, consisting of five officers and five non-officer employees. 

&#160; 

Implications of Emerging Growth Company Status 

&#160; 

As a company with less than $1 billion in revenue in our last fiscal year, we are defined as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (&#8220;JOBS&#8221;) Act. We will retain &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; status until the earliest of: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The last day of the fiscal year during which our annual revenues are equal to or exceed $1 billion; 

&#8226; The last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to in this document as the Securities Act; 

&#8226; The date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a previous three-year period; or 

&#8226; The date on which we qualify as a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) (i.e., an issuer with a public float of $700 million that has been filing reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) under the Exchange Act for at least 12 months). &#160; &#8226; As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to SEC reporting companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2002; 

&#8226; Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#8217;s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 

&#8226; Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder non-binding advisory votes; 

&#8226; Submit for stockholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; 

&#8226; Disclose certain executive compensation related items, as we will be subject to the scaled disclosure requirements of a smaller reporting company with respect to executive compensation disclosure; and 

&#8226; Present more than two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data in a registration statement for our initial public offering of our securities. &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of The JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt into the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

&#160; 

Because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, is below $75 million, we are also a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act. Some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act but remain a smaller reporting company under the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company we are not required to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and 

&#8226; Present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on Form 10-K and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports. &#160;
