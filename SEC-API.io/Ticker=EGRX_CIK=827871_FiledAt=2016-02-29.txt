 Item 1. Business 

Company Overview 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing injectable products, primarily in the critical care and oncology areas, using the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;)'s 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) regulatory pathway. Our business model is to develop proprietary innovations to FDA-approved, injectable drugs, which we refer to as branded reference drugs, that offer longer commercial duration at attractive prices compared to generic competitors. We market and/or commercialize our products through marketing partners or an external sales force and continue to improve and expand on our internal direct sales force. 

For each of our current and future pre-commercial products, we intend to enter the market no later than the first generic drug and substantially convert the market by addressing the needs of stakeholders who ultimately use our products. We believe we can further extend commercial duration through new intellectual property protection and/or orphan drug exclusivity and three years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity for future product candidates, as provided under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, as applicable. We strive to enhance branded reference drugs to optimize their ease and safety of use for healthcare providers, produce less drug waste, lower cost to stakeholders, and create the opportunity for label expansion to additional indications. Our regulatory and commercial strategy is to introduce our pre-commercial products no later than the first generic competitor of the branded reference product, which provides us with the potential for superior pricing and helps diminish competition from impending generic products to the branded reference drug. 

Our model has been validated by the approval and successful launches of our novel formulations of EP-1101 (argatroban) (&#8220;EP-1101&#8221;), Ryanodex &#174; (dantrolene sodium) (&#8220;Ryanodex&#8221;), and most recently, in January 2016, the FDA approvals and launches of docetaxel injection, non-alcohol formulation (&#8220;Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection&#8221;), and EP-3102 (rapidly infused bendamustine RTD) (&#8220;EP-3102 Bendeka&#8221;), licensed to and launched jointly with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Teva"). 

Our product portfolio now includes five approved products: EP-1101, Ryanodex, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection, diclofenac-misoprostol, and EP-3102 Bendeka. EP-1101 is marketed through two marketing partners, Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection was launched in January 2016, and EP-3102 Bendeka is being marketed by Teva. 

We currently have four product candidates in advanced stages of development, and/or under review for approval by the FDA. Additionally we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with Albany Molecular Research, Inc. ("AMRI"). Our four advanced candidates are EP-6101 Kangio&#8482; ready-to-use ("RTU") bivalirudin, currently under review for approval by the FDA, EP-4104 (dantrolene sodium) (&#8220;EP-4104&#8221;) for exertional heat stroke ("EHS"), and EP-5101 (pemetrexed) (&#8220;EP-5101&#8221;). Our leading near-term product candidate is Kangio&#8482;, a patented liquid intravenous form of Angiomax for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. EP-3101 is tentatively approved and we may begin commercializing in May 2016 upon expiry of drug exclusivity. Both EP-5101 and the potential label expansion of Ryanodex into EHS may address unmet medical needs in major specialty markets. 

In 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we accomplished the following with respect to our product portfolio: 

&#8226; 

On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka, which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the &#8220;Cephalon License&#8221;) with Cephalon, Inc. ("Cephalon"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teva, for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ("CLL") and patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ("NHL"). Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016 related to the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% on net sales of the product. 

&#8226; 

On April 7, 2015 and May 19, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) granted us Patents No. 9,000,021 and No. 9,034,908 for EP-3102 Bendeka, for treating patients requiring restricted fluid and/or sodium intake. These patents extend to March 2033. 

&#8226; 

On May 20, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for bivalirudin RTU which was accepted for filing by the FDA. The FDA action date for this NDA is March 19, 2016. 

&#8226; 

On September 29, 2015, the USPTO granted us Patent No. 9,144,568, which pertains to the use of EP-3102 Bendeka. The patent extends to March 2033. 

&#8226; 

On October 13, 2015, we entered into an exclusive U.S. licensing agreement (the &#8220;Teikoku Agreement&#8221;) with Teikoku Pharma USA, Inc. (&#8220;Teikoku&#8221;), whereby Teikoku granted to us a royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under and to Teikoku's patent rights and know how to make, use, market, commercialize, and offer for sale Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection described in NDA 205934. Pursuant to the agreement, and after the FDA&#8217;s approval of NDA 205934 which happened on December 22, 2015, Teikoku also assigned NDA 205934 to us. In consideration for the license and assignment, we made an upfront payment to Teikoku upon signing and an additional milestone payment of $4.85 million upon Teikoku&#8217;s submission of the NDA transfer letter to the FDA in February 2016. In addition, commencing with the first commercial sale of the product, we will pay to Teikoku a royalty based on the gross margin generated by the product. The royalty owed to Teikoku will be reduced by a double-digit percentage for any sales in a period during which the product is not covered by a valid claim within the Teikoku patent rights. 

&#8226; 

On January 11, 2016, we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions. 

&#8226; 

On February 23, 2016, the USPTO granted us Patent No. 9,265,831, which pertains to liquid bendamustine hydrochloride (HCl) formulations. This patent pertains to our bendamustine HCI intellectual property estate. 

In addition to building our product portfolio, we continue to develop our commercial organization. On November 4, 2015, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Spectrum&#8221;) under which the Spectrum 32-person Corporate Accounts Sales Team will dedicate 80% of its time to selling and marketing up to six of our products over a period of at least 18 months (the "Spectrum Agreement"). We will pay Spectrum a base fee of $12.8 million over 18 months, and additional payments of up to $9 million if specified targets for annual net sales of our products are met during the initial 18-month term of the Spectrum Agreement, for a potential total payment of up to $22 million during the initial term. We may extend the initial term of this agreement by six months to December 31, 2017 at our sole election. Any extensions after December 31, 2017 require mutual consent and will be for six months per extension. As part of the co-promotion agreement and long-term strategy to build an internal commercial team, we will also hire approximately 20 direct sales representatives who will be a part of our independent commercial organization. These representatives will be managed under the Spectrum sales team infrastructure for the duration of the Spectrum Agreement.

Industry Background 

Injection is a common drug delivery route for biopharmaceuticals due to the lower bioavailability of alternative administration routes. We estimate the generics injectables market is $12.0 billion globally and $7.6 billion the United States. Based on industry data, we believe that the U.S. generic injectable market will continue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3% from 

2012-2017 due to several factors, including (i) label expansion for approved products increasing the patient pool for such products, (ii) a pipeline of injectable medications at various stages of clinical development, and (iii) the increasing incidence of certain diseases that necessarily utilize injectable medications such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. Further, we estimate that the current worldwide market for the branded reference drugs addressed by our disclosed product portfolio is approximately $3.0 billion. Both Spectrum, our co-promotion partner and our commercial organization will focus on domestic GPOs (Group Purchasing Organizations), hospital groups and key stakeholders in acute care settings. Outside of the United States, we may utilize partners for the commercialization of our products, as needed. 

In general, our goal is to launch our proprietary products no later than the first generic to the branded reference drug. This allows us to take advantage of the market opportunity during its most profitable cycle where price is higher and fewer, if any, generic competitors exist. In addition, we benefit from meaningful barriers to entry that are not inherent to generic drugs under the Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") regulatory pathway, including a robust patent portfolio and the potential for three years of marketing exclusivity for our future product candidates as a result of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway of the Hatch-Waxman Act. 

A generic drug company must either (i) wait for the innovator's patents to expire or to be proven invalid to gain market entry or (ii) choose to enter the market at risk of patent infringement. Patent invalidity challenges are time consuming and complex, and outcomes are uncertain. Compared to the ANDA regulatory pathway, which is only available for generic drugs that are the same as, and bioequivalent to, the branded reference drug, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway enables us to more broadly modify our drugs while still relying on the safety and efficacy data supporting approval of the branded reference drug. We are therefore able to design our products in an effort to avoid infringing existing patents covering the branded reference drug, which, we believe, in many cases will allow us to enter the existing market earlier than applicable generic drugs. In addition, our drugs that we expect to be approved under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway are not precluded from marketing during the 180-day exclusivity period that the first ANDA holder(s) may enjoy under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 

Limitations of Existing Drug Products and Generics 

We believe that many currently available critical care and oncology injectable products have suboptimal characteristics that do not meet the needs of patients, physicians, nurses or pharmacists. These characteristics can impact safety, shelf life, convenience, waste, cost, and ease of use by practitioners and pharmacy staff. For instance, existing drugs may be packaged inefficiently or come in formulations that require reconstitution or dilution, or which are otherwise difficult or inconvenient to prepare, and which expose workers to cytotoxic compounds and can result in dosing errors. This can also lead to wasted quantities of drug, inefficiencies in staff time and constrained work flow, reduced shelf life and the need for multiple dosing of individual patients to complete treatment. 

Market Opportunity 

We believe there is a large and unmet market for developing injectable drugs that address the specific needs of patients, physicians, nurses and pharmacists to simplify their use, reduce waste and lower healthcare costs. Such improvements could also reduce infusion times, reduce dosing errors, remove unnecessary exposure to toxic materials and potentially improve the safety of the product. 

Hatch-Waxman Act. Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") describes three types of NDAs that may be submitted to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act created two additional marketing pathways under Sections 505(j) and 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm chemical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug. 

A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant's favor or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept for filing) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing a new chemical entity ("NCE") that has not been previously approved by the FDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) were essential to the approval of the application and were conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDA for drugs that include the innovation that required the new clinical data. 

Orphan Drug Act. In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for the treatment of that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years would prohibit the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances such as when a subsequent product demonstrates clinical superiority.

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our management's unique knowledge of the industry, including its ability to identify products for enhancement, its experience with the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, and its ability to navigate paragraph IV challenges, combined with our portfolio of attractive assets, enables us to compete effectively in the market for injectable therapeutics. 

Unique insight into limitations of existing products. We believe that many injectable products for use in acute care settings have suboptimal characteristics that do not meet the needs of patients, physicians, nurses or pharmacists. These characteristics can impact safety, shelf life, convenience, waste, cost, and ease of use by practitioners and pharmacy staff. Because generic drugs are essentially copies of the branded reference drugs, these suboptimal characteristics are shared by the generic versions. We have and continue to engage physicians, nurses, pharmacists and key opinion leaders "(KOL's"), to identify specific products where the characteristics described above present opportunities for product improvement. We evaluate the product opportunities presented by the stakeholders and determine whether or not they conform to our research and development planning. A key aspect of our evaluation is the intellectual property landscape for each product opportunity, including our ability to avoid infringing existing patents and the potential patentability of our modified version of the drug. We utilize our experienced team of formulators with extensive experience in branded and generic pharmaceuticals, including significant experience with injectable pharmaceuticals, and a track record of success in product development, regulatory relations, and quality assurance to develop improved products. 

Barriers to entry and intellectual property. Because our products are differentiated from the branded reference drugs, we believe we are able to avoid infringing existing patents covering the branded reference drug allowing us to enter the existing market no later than applicable generic drugs, which may be subject to protracted patent litigation delaying market entry. Protracted litigation is a significant barrier to entry for competitors seeking approval of an ANDA referencing the branded reference product, and our early entry into the market leads to less price erosion due to constrained competition. Our patent estate includes 15 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and ten filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several patent applications that have been filed in various worldwide territories, that protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our current portfolio products. We believe that other potential barriers to entry consist of one or more of the following: 

&#8226; 

our early entry into the market allows us to influence usage patterns when fewer, if any, competitors exist and allows us to market our products as improved versions of the branded reference drug prior to or concurrent with any generic entry, thereby giving us the opportunity to capture significant market share at this early stage. We believe that such early entry into the market will limit later conversions into generic versions of the branded reference drugs, deterring competition and allowing us to maintain market share and favorable pricing; 

&#8226; 

the potential for seven years of exclusivity upon approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA that receives orphan drug status; and 

&#8226; 

the potential for three years of regulatory exclusivity for our future product candidates upon approval, if any, of a 505(b)(2) NDA supported by new clinical investigations (other than bioequivalence and bioavailability studies) essential to approval of the application. 

Attractive portfolio of injectable assets that address a large market opportunity. Our product portfolio is focused on oncology, critical care, and orphan diseases and includes five approved products, one tentative approval, and three distinct product candidates in advanced development. Additionally, we have other exploratory candidates under a collaborative agreement entered into in January 2016 with AMRI. We believe that we can leverage our formulation and development expertise to achieve improved product attributes in terms of potential for longer stability, shorter infusion times, less waste and/or ease and safety of use for healthcare professionals and achieve longer commercial duration compared to generic competitors. We believe that our products may offer certain benefits as compared to existing injectable drugs which may include one or more of the following: 

&#8226; 

improved safety through elimination of reconstitution in the pharmacy or in the acute care setting; 

&#8226; 

reduction in the number of injections required; 

&#8226; 

reduction in the volume of drug needed to be injected, potentially expanding the application to additional medical situations; 

&#8226; 

reduction in the amount of diluent required to administer the drug; 

&#8226; 

reduction in drug waste; 

&#8226; 

reduction in drug infusion time; and 

&#8226; 

potential label expansion to include additional indications. 

Validated business model. We believe that our differentiated business model as compared to generic and branded specialty pharmaceutical drug companies was validated with our approval and commercial launch in the United States of a novel version of argatroban, for which we received approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA in June 2011. Our version of argatroban was formulated in a manner designed to avoid the infringement of related Orange Book patents for the branded reference product, and we were successful in doing so without triggering a patent infringement suit by the innovator of the branded reference drug. We therefore entered the 

market prior to the first generic version of argatroban and our version of the drug has reached a market share of approximately 40% of the total argatroban market. Our competitors' undifferentiated ANDAs referencing the branded drug remain tentatively approved by the FDA and, because they were not able to prove invalidity or non-infringement of the applicable patents, had to wait for approximately three years for patent expiration in June 2014 before full approval and commercialization. On June 30, 2014, two generic argatroban products were approved. 

Our most recent example of our validated business model is EP-3102 Bendeka. On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of injectable pharmaceutical products for use in acute care settings. Our strategy to achieve this goal includes: 

Enter the market no later than the first generic drug. We intend to enter the market no later than the first generic of the branded reference drug. During this period, the number of competitors is lowest and branded drugs are generally at peak or near peak value. This will allow us to influence usage patterns and market our products as improved versions, thereby achieving favorable pricing. Even if we enter the market simultaneously with, or after, the first generic drug, as a 505(b)(2) applicant, we would be able to enter the market without regard to any generic drug's 180-day exclusivity period. 

Retain commercial rights in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States. In general, we believe that we can cost-effectively commercialize our products in the United States internally or through a contracted sales force and selected commercial arrangements, and thereby retain commercial value of these products. We have established a small, contract specialty sales force focusing on GPOs, hospital systems and key stakeholders in acute care settings, primarily hospitals. In an effort to expand on our commercial strategy, we will grow our internal sales force by 20 and have partnered with Spectrum to commercialize our products. Outside of the United States, we may utilize partners for the commercialization of our products, as needed. 

Strengthen our product portfolio. We intend to continue to strengthen our product portfolio in the areas of oncology, critical care and orphan diseases. We will continue to develop our current product portfolio and leverage our expertise to identify new products with suboptimal characteristics that present us with significant opportunity for revenue generation. In addition to our internal efforts, we will opportunistically in-license or acquire product candidates that fit our therapeutic areas of focus and meet our rigorous evaluation process. 

Continue to build a robust intellectual property portfolio. Our patent estate includes 15 owned or exclusively-licensed U.S. issued patents and 10 filed U.S. patent applications, as well as several that have been filed in various worldwide territories, that protect or will protect, as applicable the market value of our approved and pipeline products. These patents consist primarily of formulation and method-of-use patents. We intend to continue to build our patent portfolio by filing for patent protection on new developments with respect to our product candidates that will not infringe patents that cover the branded reference drugs. We expect that these will, if issued, allow us to list our own patents in the Orange Book, to which potential competitors will be required to certify upon submission of their applications referencing our products, if approved.

Bendamustine is an alkylating agent approved for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL, that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen (which we refer to herein as the NHL indication). 

EP-3101 RTD 

We have developed EP-3101 RTD, an RTD, multi-dose liquid with extended drug stability for use with a 500mL intravenous, or IV, infusion bag, for which we were granted tentative patent approval. Due to drug exclusivity on Treanda &#174; , the earliest that the 

tentative approval we received may convert to final approval is May 2016 at which time we may commercialize the product. 

Teva License- Bendeka 

EP-3102 Bendeka is the same RTD, multi-dose liquid formulation as EP-3101 RTD, with extended drug stability, but for use with a 50 mL IV infusion bag, which enables it to be administered in a shorter time-period than current drugs on the market and represents a label expansion from EP-3101 RTD. We received orphan drug designation drug designation for EP-3102 Bendeka for CLL and NHL in July 2014. In November 2014 we announced positive results from the EP-3102 Bendeka clinical trial, in which the dose was delivered in a 50mL admixture in ten minutes versus a 500mL admixture in the 60-minute infusion required for Treanda&#174; (bendamustine HCl). In this study, EP-3102 Bendeka was found to be bioequivalent to Treanda &#174; , which was the primary endpoint of the study. The incidence and profile of adverse events, both infusion-related and general, for EP-3102 Bendeka was comparable to Treanda &#174; . This is particularly important because EP-3102 Bendeka delivers the same amount of active ingredient as Treanda &#174; &#32;but with a lower admixture volume, which enables our product to be administered more quickly. 

On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka, which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License, for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016, related to the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supplying product to Cephalon for a specified period. In connection with the Cephalon License, on February 13, 2015, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement (the "Cephalon Settlement Agreement") with Cephalon, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the &#8216;270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL with EP-3102 Bendeka. 

U.S. Marketed Bendamustine Products 

Teva currently markets its bendamustine product under the trade name Treanda &#174; &#32;which Teva has said will be available through March 30, 2016, at which time we expect EP-3102 Bendeka will replace Treanda &#174; liquid. 

Eagle's Solution: EP-3101 RTD and EP-3102 Bendeka 

The EP-3101 RTD and EP-3102 Bendeka liquid formulations eliminate the need to reconstitute the drug prior to use, relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda &#174; . As a result, we believe that relative to the lyophilized presentation of Treanda &#174; there is less potential for dosing errors, less exposure to cytotoxic powders and a more efficient work flow. 

Additionally, admixtures prepared with EP-3102 Bendeka contain lower sodium as compared with Treanda &#174; which could be of benefit to the predominantly elderly, renally impaired and cardiovascular compromised patients. Also, EP-3102 Bendeka is available in a multi-use vial, which allows infusion centers and hospitals to avoid needless waste of unused drug remaining after procedures with single use vials. 

Our bendamustine product candidates could be reimbursed using a new and unique "J-code" assigned for injectable drugs. If we can demonstrate that EP-3102 Bendeka for administration in a smaller infusion volume is clinically significantly different than the other drugs that share the J-code, such as Treanda &#174; , the Center for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services ("CMS"), may assign a unique J-code allowing more pricing flexibility. 

Ryanodex &#174; &#32;(dantrolene) for Malignant Hyperthermia 

Overview 

Dantrolene was first introduced to the U.S. market in 1979 and is currently the only drug approved to treat a rare genetic disorder called malignant hyperthermia ("MH"). There are only 500 to 800 cases of MH in the United States each year, qualifying dantrolene for orphan drug designation. This disease is triggered when a patient with this genetic predisposition has a surgical procedure and 

is exposed to certain inhaled anesthetics or the muscle relaxant, succinylcholine. When this exposure occurs, a metabolic response can be triggered in the patient resulting in an episode of MH that can be fatal if not treated immediately. Because dantrolene is the only approved drug available to treat MH, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, ("the Joint Commission") requires that all hospitals stock vials of this product at all times, generally in the operating room area. In July, 2014 we received FDA approval for Ryanodex &#174; (dantrolene sodium). 

Currently-Preexisitng Dantrolene Products for MH 

The two preexisting dantrolene drugs on the market for the treatment of MH, Dantrium &#174; &#32;and Revonto &#174; , are offered in a vial containing 20mg of lyophilized powder that requires mixing with 60mL of sterile water. We estimate that the addressable U.S. market opportunity for MH drugs is approximately $75 million per year. 

Limitations of Dantrium &#174; &#32;and Revonto &#174; &#160; 

When an MH crisis occurs during surgery, the surgical procedure is immediately discontinued and the anesthesiologist and others in the operating room quickly begin reconstituting dantrolene, often at the same time as performing other resuscitative efforts, in order to administer the drug to the patient as an IV push. Based on recommendations from the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States ("MHAUS"), the recognized authority on treating MH in the United States, the recommended dose is 2.5mg/kg or higher. It is critically important that the drug be administered as rapidly as possible, as MH symptoms include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, raised CO 2 &#32;&#32;levels and very high body temperature levels. If not treated immediately, the disease can be fatal. 

Because of the dosing required in adult patients to reverse the MH symptoms and the current formulations of Dantrium &#174; &#32;and Revonto &#174; , it is often necessary to reconstitute 10 to 20 vials of dantrolene. As the current formulations are also poorly water soluble, this process generally takes up to 15 to 20 minutes at a point when time is critical and the patient is extremely unstable. Furthermore, the volume of diluent required to reconstitute Dantrium &#174; &#32;and Revonto &#174; &#32;means that the adult patient receives a significant volume of fluid (600mL to 1,200mL) as an IV infusion, which on occasion can result in detrimental secondary physiological consequences for the patient, such as pulmonary edema and extravasation, which can lead to tissue necrosis. 

Eagle's Solution: Ryanodex &#174; &#32;(dantrolene sodium) 

We have developed a differentiated formulation of dantrolene sodium that was approved by the FDA in July 2014 and is currently sold under the brand name, Ryanodex &#174; , for the treatment of MH. The presentation is a 5ml vial containing 250mg of dantrolene sodium in lyophilized powder form. 

We believe that the immediate benefits of our Ryanodex &#174; &#32;formulation are clinically significant in critical care situations. Specifically, Ryanodex &#174; &#32;reduces the amount of time to reconstitute and administer dantrolene from 15 to 20 minutes with Dantrium &#174; and Revonto &#174; , to one minute, as the anesthesiologist will be able to mix and administer a dose of 250mg from a single vial of Ryanodex &#174; &#32;in contrast to mixing and administering up to 12 or more vials of Dantrium &#174; &#32;or Revonto &#174; . A recent retrospective study conducted by MHAUS demonstrated that every 15-minute delay in treating MH resulted in a 7.8% increase in patient complications. Additionally, fluid volume to the patient may also be reduced from up to 720mL or more with Dantrium &#174; &#32;and Revonto &#174; &#32;compared to only 5mL with Ryanodex &#174; , potentially further reducing secondary physiological complications for the patient. 

Sales and Marketing 

We contracted a third party logistics partner that stores our inventory of Ryanodex &#174; , fulfills sales orders and provides detailed real- time reporting. Initially, we contracted with a third party sales force who were focusing their promotional activities of Ryanodex &#174; on important stakeholders within the hospital setting, and we are currently migrating these efforts to our commercial organization. To complement these efforts, we have also engaged group purchasing organizations and wholesalers in contracting discussions. 

Docetaxel Injection, Non-Alcohol Formula 

On October 13, 2015, we entered into the Teikoku Agreement, whereby Teikoku granted to us a royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under and to Teikoku's patent rights and know how to make, use, market, commercialize, and offer for sale Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection described in NDA 205934. Pursuant to the agreement, and after the FDA&#8217;s approval of NDA 205934 which happened on December 22, 2015, Teikoku also assigned NDA 205934 to us. In consideration for the license and assignment, we made an upfront payment to Teikoku upon signing and an additional milestone payment of $4.85 million upon Teikoku&#8217;s submission of the NDA transfer letter to the FDA in February 2016. In addition, commencing with the first 

commercial sale of the product, we will pay to Teikoku a royalty based on the gross margin generated by the product. The royalty owed to Teikoku will be reduced by a double-digit percentage for any sales in a period during which the product is not covered by a valid claim within the Teikoku patent rights. 

Limitations of Docetaxel Injection 

In June 2014, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication warning patients that docetaxel may cause symptoms of alcohol intoxication after treatment. Manufacturers of docetaxel formulations for domestic use were subsequently required to revise their product labels to reflect alcohol content and include a drug safety warning. Some U.S. hospitals and clinics require patients to wait two or more hours after treatment with docetaxel before they can be released. 

Eagle's Solution 

Eagle&#8217;s non-alcohol formulation of docetaxel was specifically developed to address the FDA concerns regarding the alcohol content and symptoms of intoxication. 

Sales and Marketing 

We contracted a third party logistics partner who will store our inventory of Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection and will fulfill sales orders and provide detailed real time reporting. Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection is being marketed by our commercial organization. 

EP-4104 (dantrolene) for Exertional Heat Stroke 

EHS is a rare, sudden and unpredictable life-threatening medical condition. It is thought that symptoms and effects are correlated to MH and our research and development efforts suggest dantrolene may be beneficial for treating EHS. 

EHS is one of the leading causes of death in athletes, including college and high-school students. EHS is also a leading cause of non-combat death in the military. EHS is a state of extreme hyperthermia (above 104&#176;F) that occurs when heat that is generated by muscular exercise exceeds the body's ability to dissipate it at the same rate. EHS typically affects young, seemingly healthy individuals during exercise and manifests within a few minutes to hours of such activity and is characterized by an increased core body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction including delirium, convulsions, and coma. Predisposing factors to EHS include a lack of heat acclimatization, poor physical fitness, dehydration, recent infection, exercising in warm and humid conditions and concurrent illness. There may also be a genetic component related to those who suffer from MH. The pathogenesis of EHS is multifactorial and complex and not completely understood, but it is believed that a defect in the calcium transport in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum is a key component of both EHS and MH. This link suggests that the genetic variant which predisposes patients to MH also puts those patients at an increased susceptibility to EHS. 

Limitations of Current EHS Therapies 

There are currently no FDA-approved products that treat EHS, and patients continue to die or suffer significant morbidity from the condition. Independent market research commissioned by us suggests that the worldwide peak annual revenue for EHS could exceed $400 million. The current treatment regimen for EHS is not directed at the underlying cause of the disease, but is essentially symptomatic therapy, which in some cases results in mortality or permanent organ damage. Currently, to treat EHS, the standard treatment includes body surface cooling by water immersion or ice packs and support of organ system function with a goal of accelerating the transfer of heat from the skin to the environment. Even if these cooling techniques are properly implemented patients are still subject to risk of brain damage, irreversible organ damage and death. 

Eagle's Solution: EP-4104 (dantrolene) for EHS 

EP-4104's presentation will be initially similar to Eagle's presentation of Ryanodex &#174; &#32;(dantrolene for MH) - a 5mL vial containing 250mg of dantrolene in lyophilized powder form requiring reconstitution. Like Ryanodex &#174; , only one 5mL injection of EP-4104 will be required to initially treat EHS, avoiding the potential need to reconstitute up to 12 or more vials of drug in a short time, as is the treatment for MH when using low concentration formulations of dantrolene. Additionally, because our formulation of EP-4104 could be carried by emergency responders (currently impractical with other dantrolene products due to the large IV volume of up to 720 mL or more that could be required to administer a therapeutic dose), we believe that administering EP-4104 in the field, prior to arriving at the hospital, would be possible. Given that immediate treatment for EHS is crucial for improving outcomes, 

we believe that our formulation would provide significant benefits over the current standard of care, which may not be readily available in most settings. 

EP-4104 Clinical Development and Regulatory Status 

EP-4104 has completed a clinical study in human volunteers and we are currently designing a pivotal clinical study to support our NDA submission. Our clinical development plan was discussed with FDA at a Type C meeting in the first quarter of 2015, and we filed an IND submission in July 2015. Additionally, we were granted orphan drug designation for EP-4104 for EHS in September 2012. 

In December 2015, we had successful outcomes from the safety and efficacy study which took place in &#32; September, 2015 at the Emergency Departments of four hospitals during the Hajj pilgrimage in the Makkah region, Saudi Arabia. Due to the life-threatening, unpredictable and sudden nature of EHS, the study was required to be conducted in an emergency and acute-care medical setting. 

In February 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Ryanodex &#174; &#32;for the treatment of EHS. The FDA's Fast Track program facilitates the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. A drug development program with Fast Track designation is afforded greater access to the FDA for the purpose of expediting the drug's development, review and potential approval to get important new drugs to the patient earlier. 

EP-5101 (pemetrexed) for Lung Cancer 

Pemetrexed is an IV-administered cancer agent indicated for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. We are developing EP-5101 as a ready-to-use/dilute liquid form of pemetrexed that will be available in a 500mg multi-dose vial. We are currently conducting registration batch studies and supporting toxicology studies on EP-5101. Because our product will be available in liquid form, product reconstitution will not be required, making EP-5101 a preferred formulation under the Joint Commission guidelines. 

Currently-Marketed Pemetrexed Product 

The branded form of pemetrexed is marketed by Lilly Pharmaceuticals as Alimta. Alimta is approved for use to treat non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. The product presentations for Alimta are 100mg and 500mg single use vials containing lyophilized power that must be reconstituted before patient administration. Once mixed, Alimta must be used within 24 hours due to product stability concerns. According to Lilly Pharmaceuticals, worldwide sales of Alimta for the 2015 calendar year were approximately $2.5 billion. 

Limitations of Alimta 

Alimta, a lyophilized formulation requiring reconstitution, adds time to administration, presents cytotoxic safety issues for healthcare professionals administering the drug and the potential for dosing errors. Because reconstitution of Alimta is generally not performed until the patient has cleared all tests necessary to receive the drug, this process contributes to a significant amount of time spent by such patients in infusion clinics. Additionally, this method of administration limits the number of patients that may be treated on any given day by such clinics. Additionally, as with any oncology drug, cytotoxic vapors released through reconstitution can be potentially harmful to pharmacists, physicians and nurses. Moreover, dosing errors may occur during reconstitution, as incorrect amounts of diluent may be used. As a result, lyophilized formulations are less preferred by the Joint Commission as compared to an RTD product. 

Eagle's Solution: EP-5101 (Pemetrexed) 

EP-5101 is an RTD liquid formulation of pemetrexed that we are designing as a 500mg multi-dose vial. As an RTD liquid formulation, EP-5101 will not require additional time for reconstitution and will avoid certain safety concerns to healthcare professionals and potential dosing errors during mixing. This allows for a more efficient work flow within the infusion clinic, may result in more patients being seen each day and reduces exposure to the drug's cytotoxic vapors during reconstitution by healthcare providers. 

The benefits of our proposed formulation identified by our research included a reduction in dosing errors as no reconstitution is required, as well as more flexibility in patient scheduling, possibly allowing a greater number of patients to be seen each day. Also 

mentioned was a possible opportunity to reduce office staff due to a more efficient work flow within the infusion clinic. 

EP-5101 (pemetrexed) Development and Regulatory Status 

We plan to seek U.S. approval of EP-5101 for use in non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. Registration batches have been produced and we are anticipating a 505(b)(2) NDA submission in late 2016 in the United States. 

EP-6101 Kangio&#8482; (bivalirudin) injection, 5 mg/mL for Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty 

Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor, administered as an IV infusion and indicated for use as an anticoagulant during coronary surgical procedures. We are developing Kangio&#8482; injection, 5 mg/mL as a RTU, liquid formulation of bivalirudin in a 250 mL vial that can be administered to patients without having to reconstitute the drug. As a result, Kangio&#8482; injection, 5 mg/mL will be Joint Commission-preferred. 

Currently-Marketed Bivalirudin Product 

Bivalirudin is marketed by The Medicines Company in the United States under the brand name Angiomax. The approved product's presentation is a vial containing 250 mg of lyophilized powder which requires reconstitution. Worldwide net sales of Angiomax were $212 million in 2015, which represented a decrease from $635 million in 2014 due to competition from generic versions of bivalirudin following the loss of market exclusivity in the United States in July 2015 and in Europe in August 2015. 

Limitations of Angiomax 

The powder form of Angiomax must be reconstituted before administration at the beginning of a catheter laboratory ("cath lab") procedure, then further diluted into an IV bag. As with any drug requiring reconstitution, mixing can result in dosing errors if, for example, the wrong diluent or incorrect amount of diluent is added to the product. Additionally, reconstitution takes time, which results in slower work flows. Finally, Angiomax is limited in that the Joint Commission guidelines encourage the use of RTU presentations over products that require reconstitution. Additionally, U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the scientific nonprofit organization that sets standards for medicines manufactured, distributed and consumed worldwide and whose drug standards are enforceable in the United States by the FDA, has issued USP 797, a far-reaching regulation that governs any pharmacy that prepares compounded sterile preparations and, among other things, requires that drug compounding be done in a clean room environment by a licensed pharmacist. In many situations where no licensed pharmacist is available (for example, during late-night shifts), nurses and other healthcare providers are required to mix the drug themselves. 

Eagle's Solution: Kangio&#8482; (bivalirudin) injection, 5 mg/mL 

Kangio&#8482; has been developed as a bivalirudin RTU liquid formulation to resolve each of the current limitations of Angiomax identified above. If approved, our product formulation would be available for immediate patient administration with no reconstitution required. This would save time and reduce risks of dosing errors during reconstitution. Additionally, because no mixing of our drug is required, compliance with regulations such as USP 797 can be achieved regardless of the situation in which our drug is required to be administered. 

Kangio&#8482; (bivalirudin) injection, 5 mg/mL Development and Regulatory Status 

The 505(b)(2) NDA for Kangio&#8482; was accepted by the FDA in July 2015 with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of March 19, 2016. 

EP-1101 argatroban for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia 

Argatroban is an anti-coagulant originally developed for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ("HIT"). Our formulation of argatroban, EP-1101, is our first product approved by the FDA, and marketed by The Medicines Company and Sandoz under agreements with us. Through our agreement with The Medicines Company, we granted The Medicines Company exclusive rights to commercialize argatroban in the United States and Canada and a right of first negotiation to commercialize argatroban in other countries (except China). Through our settlement agreement and related supply and distribution agreement with Sandoz, we granted Sandoz the right to distribute an unbranded (generic) version of argatroban in 50mg/50mL vials in the 

United States. Through our contract manufacturer we supply The Medicines Company with argatroban in 50mg/50mL vials and we supply Sandoz with an unbranded (generic) version of argatroban in 50mg/50mL vials. Sandoz also markets argatroban in 125mg/125mL vials and pursuant to our agreements with Sandoz, Sandoz is obligated to pay us a majority of the net profits Sandoz receives for sales of such product in the United States. For more information regarding these agreements, see below under "- License Agreements." 

Currently-Marketed Argatroban Products 

Argatroban is currently sold by GSK, West-ward, The Medicines Company and Sandoz. It is sold in 250mL (GSK and West-ward), 125mL (Sandoz) and 50mL (The Medicines Company and Sandoz) presentations. According to IMS Health, argatroban had U.S. annual sales of $99 million in 2012. In June 2014, there were two new ANDA approvals granted to competitors, Par Sterile Products, LLC and Mylan Institutional LLC, increasing competition. 

Limitations of Argatroban 

The branded form of argatroban from GSK and West-ward is supplied in a 2.5 mL vial with 100 mg/mL of active pharmaceutical ingredient. In this formulation, the current product requires 100-fold dilution for infusion, requiring the use of a 250 mL intravenous bag, typically resulting in approximately 30% waste primarily driven by prophylactic administration while waiting for HIT testing results, common infection control policies requiring change of intravenous bags every 24 hours and patient release from hospital prior to complete administration. 

Eagle's Solution: EP-1101 Argatroban Injection 

EP-1101 our formulation of argatroban is supplied in a single-use vial, containing 50mg of drug in a 50mL aqueous solution, where only 1% of the drug is wasted. EP-1101 is ready to use and the vial label contains a ring sling for convenient IV pole administration. It was approved by the FDA on June 29, 2011, for treatment of HIT in patients. 

Additional Products in our Portfolio 

We are pursuing several potential products that address broad indications such as oncology, infectious diseases and others. We intend to use our novel and well-developed methods to identify ideal development candidates and to commercialize improved formulations of widely prescribed therapeutics. 

In addition to our internal efforts, in January 2016 we entered into an agreement with AMRI to jointly develop and manufacture several select and complex parenteral drug products for registration and subsequent commercialization in the United States. 

Under the terms of the agreement, AMRI will develop and initially provide cGMP manufacturing and analytical support for the registration of the new product candidates. We will be responsible for advancing the product candidates through clinical trials and regulatory submissions. 

Sales and Marketing 

Historically, we have chosen to out-license the commercial rights for products we have developed, such as EP-1101 which launched in the United States in 2011 and is sold by The Medicines Company as argatroban in the United States and Canada under an exclusive license from us. Additionally, in 2013 our management decided to license certain rights to commercialize argatroban in the United States to Sandoz as part of a settlement of a paragraph IV dispute between the parties. Sandoz has developed strong relationships with the pharmaceutical group purchasing organizations and wholesalers, providing stronger commercial terms for argatroban with these important customers. 

On February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License, for U.S. and Canadian rights to our bendamustine rapid infusion product for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. 

For more information regarding these license agreements see below under "License Agreements". 

On November 4, 2015, we entered into the Spectrum Agreement under which the Spectrum 32-person Corporate Accounts Sales Team will dedicate 80% of its time to selling and marketing up to six of our products over a period of at least 18 months. We will pay Spectrum a base fee of $12.8 million over 18 months, and additional payments of up to $9 million if specified targets for 

annual net sales of our products are met during the initial term of the Spectrum Agreement, for a potential total payment of up to $22 million during the initial term. We may extend the initial term of this agreement by six months to December 31, 2017 at our sole election. Any extensions after December 31, 2017 require mutual consent and will be for six months per extension. As part of the co-promotion agreement and long-term strategy to build an internal commercial team, we will also hire approximately 20 direct sales representatives who will be a part of our independent commercial organization. These representatives will be managed under the Spectrum sales team infrastructure for the duration of the Spectrum Agreement. 

Other than with respect to the arrangement with Sandoz and The Medicines Company described below, we will commercialize our product portfolio in the United States with our commercial organization along with our co-promotion partner. Under the Cephalon License, Teva is commercializing EP-3102 Bendeka. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own any manufacturing facilities. The manufacture of sterile injectables is highly reliant on very complex sterile techniques and personnel aseptic techniques which present significant challenges and requires specialized expertise. Further, sterile processes have a high level of scrutiny by regulatory agencies. Consequently, we utilize a network of third party manufacturers for production of our products. All manufacturers are monitored and evaluated by our quality department to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks. 

Historically, sterile injectable manufacturers have, from time to time, had quality control difficulties. If non-conformances occur, remediation, such as temporary voluntary closure or renovations of major production facilities, could be costly and time consuming, resulting in cascading and persistent shortages. Moreover, high rates of capacity utilization may also limit the ability of manufacturers to perform routine maintenance and keep facilities in state of compliance which can lead to product recalls or other supply disruptions. 

We have a highly experienced quality group that works with and regularly inspects or meets with our manufacturers to review the manufacturing process for our products and to provide input on quality issues. We have recognized the risk of such supply chain disruptions and approached the situation through risk management strategies designed to mitigate the effects of such disruptions. These include having our products and product candidates manufactured at more than one site around the world. While this creates additional effort and requires maintaining dialog and traveling to and overseeing production at a number of facilities, we believe our manufacturing risks are better managed by utilizing a range of third party manufacturers at diverse locations. We seek to minimize the risk of catastrophic events that could occur if our products were manufactured in a single location. Currently, with the exception of one site, no contract manufacturer produces more than one product for us. We currently utilize two manufacturing sites in India and four manufacturing site in the United States. We plan to manufacture the additional products in our portfolio at additional sites in the United States. 

Intellectual Property and Exclusivity 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business. We seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our products or product candidates, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to our business model and maintaining a competitive advantage over generic competitors. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our products and product candidates. 

Patents and Patent Applications 

We are the exclusive licensee under our license with Lyotropic to a family of patents and applications that relate to low volume formulations of dantrolene, and methods of treatment using dantrolene. There are four issued U.S. patents, and two pending U.S. patent application, along with foreign counterparts that include both issued patents and pending applications. The issued U.S. patents (US 8,110,225, US 7,758,890 and US 8,604,072, US 8,685,460) cover low volume formulations of dantrolene in reconstitutable and in ready to use liquid form. We expect that the issued patents will expire no later than July 1, 2025, and the applications, if issued, will expire no later than June 13, 2022.

Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information 

Trade secrets play an important role in protecting our products and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. The scale-up and commercial manufacture of our products involves processes, custom equipment, and in-process and release analytical techniques that we believe are unique to us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these security measures, individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring third parties with whom we contract for services related to our products, including manufacturing services to agree to terms in our agreements with such third parties that protect our confidential and trade secret information. We also require our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials. 

License Agreements 

License Agreement with Lyotropic Therapeutics, Inc. 

In October 2008, we entered into a license and sublicense agreement with Lyotropic Therapeutics, Inc., or Lyotropic, under which we were granted an exclusive license under Lyotropic's intellectual property rights relating to dantrolene, and an exclusive worldwide sublicense under certain nanocrystal technology relating to a formulation of dantrolene licensed by Alkermes, Inc. (as successor in interest to Elan Pharma International Limited), or Alkermes, to Lyotropic under an August 2004 license agreement between Alkermes and Lyotropic. 

Under the terms of this license agreement with Lyotropic, we are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of all of the licensed patents that solely or predominantly cover the dantrolene product. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to progress the development of our dantrolene product in the United States, and after completion of required clinical trials, to file a 505(b)(2) application in the United States for such product. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval and make commercial sales of our dantrolene product in at least two countries in Europe, in Japan and in at least one of Korea, Australia, Canada or Brazil within certain specified time periods, or to enter into a bona fide sublicense agreement under which a third party would progress commercialization of the product in such country or countries. These time periods may be extended if additional clinical trials are required in any such country in order to obtain regulatory approval in such 

country. Each of Europe, Japan and the rest of the countries in the world, including Korea, Australia, Canada or Brazil are considered to be separate Ex-U.S. Regions for the purpose of our license with Lyotropic. If we fail to comply with these commercial and regulatory diligence obligations in, each of the Ex-U.S. Regions, our license in the applicable Ex-U.S. Region will be revoked, and we will be required to discontinue operations in relation to the product in the applicable countries, and to transfer to Lyotropic all materials and information developed by us in relation to our dantrolene product in the Ex-U.S. Regions. 

Under our license agreement with Lyotropic, we are not required to make any milestone payments but we are required to pay royalties on a country-by-country basis at a percentage in the mid-teens on net sales of our dantrolene product until the earlier of (i) the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale of our dantrolene product in such country and expiration of the last valid claim covering such product in such country and (ii) with respect to any country in which we or our affiliates (but not our sublicensees) are selling the dantrolene product, as of the beginning of the first fiscal quarter following the date of the first commercial sale of a generic version of our dantrolene product that results in a decrease in our net profits in such country by a specified percentage based on our average quarterly net profits for sales of our dantrolene product in such country over the 18 months immediately preceding the launch of such generic product. 

Our agreement with Lyotropic will continue in force until terminated. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party's insolvency or material uncured breach, and we have the right to terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice if, in our sole discretion, commercial development of the dantrolene product is no longer commercially reasonable. 

License and Development Agreement with The Medicines Company 

In September 2009, we entered into a license and development agreement with The Medicines Company under which we granted The Medicines Company an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights in argatroban to commercialize argatroban products in the United States and Canada, and a right of first negotiation to commercialize argatroban in other countries (except the right of first negotiation does not apply to China unless and until we regain rights to commercialize argatroban products in China). 

Under this agreement, we are responsible for development and obtaining regulatory approvals for argatroban in the United States, at our cost, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such activities. The Medicines Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such argatroban products. We are also responsible, at our cost, for prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents that cover the argatroban products, although The Medicines Company is required to reimburse us for half of our costs. 

Under this agreement, we received an upfront lump sum payment of $5.0 million. Additionally, we are obligated to share equally gross profits we receive from Sandoz pursuant to the Sandoz Supply and Distribution Agreement with The Medicines Company and The Medicines Company is obligated to share equally with us the gross profits it receives from sales of argatroban product in the United States. 

Our agreement with The Medicines Company will continue in force until terminated. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party's material uncured breach, and The Medicines Company has the right to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis upon 60 days written notice to us. In November 2011, we initiated a voluntary product recall of the argatroban product which was reintroduced on the market in May 2012. Under a 2012 amendment to this agreement we agreed to and received net payment of $471,077 from The Medicines Company. In 2009, we and The Medicines Company also entered into a related supply agreement under which we are the exclusive supplier of argatroban product to The Medicines Company for sales in the United States and Canada. This agreement will remain in force for a period of ten years, unless our license to The Medicines Company is terminated, in which case the supply agreement will automatically terminate. Either we or The Medicines Company may also terminate this supply agreement for uncured material breach. 

Settlement Agreement and Related Supply and Distribution Agreement with Sandoz 

In January 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sandoz Inc., ("Sandoz") to resolve the suit we brought against Sandoz claiming infringement of our issued U.S. patents 7,589,106 and 7,687,516, based on Sandoz's filing of ANDA No. 203743, in which Sandoz requested approval from the FDA for distribution of argatroban prior to the expiration of such patents. In connection with, and at the same time as the settlement agreement, we also entered into a Supply and Distribution Agreement with Sandoz, under which we agreed to supply unbranded (generic) argatroban in 50mg/50mL vials, which we define as an Authorized Generic Product, to Sandoz through our contract manufacturer for exclusive distribution to Sandoz's customers in the United States. 

Under the terms of the Supply and Distribution Agreement, Sandoz is obligated to pay us a percentage in the range of 85 to 

95 percent of the net profits for all Authorized Generic Product sold by Sandoz. Also, under the terms of the Supply and Distribution Agreement, Sandoz will continue to market argatroban in 125mg/125mL vials, which we define as a Sandoz Product, and Sandoz is obligated to pay us a percentage in the range of 60 to 70 percent of the net profits of all Sandoz Product sold by Sandoz. 

Sandoz was authorized to begin commercial sales of our argatroban 50mg/50mL product in the United States upon execution of this agreement and the agreement will continue in force for three years from the date of signing. The agreement will automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives notice to the other of non-renewal at least six months prior to each renewal date. Either we or Sandoz may terminate this agreement earlier for the other party's uncured material breach, insolvency or force majeure. In addition, either we or Sandoz may terminate the agreement earlier if the agreement violates or could violate applicable laws, or if a party is subjected to increased risk due to a change in laws or regulations after the effective date of the agreement, in each case based on the opinion of governmental agencies and/or the advice of legal counsel, or if it is no longer commercially viable to continue sales of argatroban in the 50mg/50mL preparation in the United States, which is defined as the point at which net sales fall below a specified percentage of the cost argatroban product is sold to Sandoz under the agreement. 

Development and License Agreement with SciDose (argatroban and bivalirudin) 

In June 2007 we entered into a development and license agreement with SciDose, LLC ("SciDose") in which SciDose assigned us certain patents relating to argatroban, bivalirudin, and two additional products under development or ("the SciDose Subject Products") and granted us an exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide (excluding China for all products except ANDA products containing bivalirudin), license under SciDose's intellectual property rights to develop, make, use, sell and import parenteral formulations of the SciDose Subject Products (and including all other formulations for one of the additional products under development). 

Our collaboration with SciDose is guided by a joint development committee. SciDose is responsible, at its cost, for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents that cover the SciDose Subject Products. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain marketing authorization for and commercialize the SciDose Subject Products under this agreement. 

Under the terms of this Agreement, no further milestone payments are due to SciDose. We are required to make royalty payments based on gross profits of sales of the SciDose Subject Products by us and our affiliates (i) at 15% for Bivalirudin products, as amended in 2015, and at 50% for other SciDose Subject Products that achieve regulatory approval and are commercialized on the basis of a 505(b)(2) application (provided that we are entitled to recoup all of our expenses related to the development of a product commercialized under a 505(b)(2) application prior to splitting the profits we receive from such product), and (ii) at a percentage in the range of 20 to 30 percent with respect to SciDose Subject Products that are commercialized on the basis of an ANDA application. Our royalty obligations continue on a product-by-product basis until the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of each SciDose Subject Product and the expiration of the last valid claim covering such SciDose Subject Product, subject to certain customary reductions in the event that there is no valid patent claim covering the manufacture, use, import or sale of such SciDose Subject Product in a country in the territory. In the event we grant a license to any third party under the patents assigned to us or the intellectual property rights licensed to us with respect to any SciDose Subject Product, we are required to pay to SciDose 100% of all milestone payments we receive with respect to commercialization of any such SciDose Subject Products outside the United States, and a percentage in the range of 45 to 55 percent of any milestone payments we receive with respect to commercialization of any such SciDose Subject Products in the United States. 

This agreement expires upon the expiration of our royalty obligations. The agreement may be terminated earlier by either us or SciDose, for the other party's material uncured breach and we may terminate this agreement on a product-by-product basis if the costs and expenses related to clinical trials for a SciDose Subject Product exceed a specified threshold. 

Development and License Agreement with Robert One, LLC (bendamustine) 

In March 2008 we entered into a development and license agreement with Robert One, LLC ("Robert One") in which Robert One assigned to us certain patents relating to bendamustine and four additional 505(b)(2) products and/or ANDA products under development ("the Robert One (bendamustine) Subject Products") and granted us an exclusive, sub-licensable, license under Robert One's intellectual property rights to develop make, use, sell and import Robert One (bendamustine) Subject Products worldwide (excluding China) with respect to bendamustine and other 505(b)(2) product applications and in North America with respect to ANDA product applications.

Bendamustine License Agreement 

On February 13, 2015, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for EP-3102 Bendeka which was approved by the FDA on December 8, 2015. Also, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon License with Cephalon, for U.S. and Canadian rights to EP-3102 Bendeka for treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL. Pursuant to the terms of the Cephalon License, Cephalon is responsible for all U.S. commercial activities for the product including promotion and distribution, and we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all regulatory approvals and conducting post-approval clinical studies. Additionally, under the terms of the Cephalon License, we received an upfront cash payment of $30 million, received a $15 million milestone in January 2016 on the FDA approval of EP-3102 Bendeka in December 2015 and are currently eligible to receive up to $65 million in additional milestone payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments of 20% of net sales of the product. In connection with the Cephalon License, we have entered into a supply agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supplying product to Cephalon for a specified period. 

Cephalon Settlement and License Agreement 

In connection with the Cephalon License, on February 13, 2015, we entered into the Cephalon Settlement Agreement with Cephalon, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the pending patent infringement claims against each other regarding Cephalon's US Patent No. 8,791,270, under which we agreed to enter into a Consent Judgment regarding the &#8216;270 patent. As part of the Cephalon Settlement Agreement, Cephalon has agreed to waive its orphan drug exclusivities for the treatment of patients with CLL and patients with NHL with EP-3102. 

Teikoku License Agreement 

On October 13, 2015, we entered into the Teikoku Agreement, whereby Teikoku granted to us a royalty-bearing, exclusive right and license under and to Teikoku's patent rights and know how to make, use, market, commercialize, and offer for sale Non-Alcohol Docetaxel Injection described in NDA 205934. Pursuant to the agreement, and after the FDA&#8217;s approval of NDA 205934 which happened on December 22, 2015, Teikoku also assigned NDA 205934 to us. In consideration for the license and assignment, we made an upfront payment to Teikoku upon signing and an additional milestone payment of $4.85 million upon Teikoku&#8217;s submission of the NDA transfer letter to the FDA in February 2016. In addition, commencing with the first commercial sale of the product, we will pay to Teikoku a royalty based on the gross margin generated by the product. The royalty owed to Teikoku will be reduced by a double-digit percentage for any sales in a period during which the product is not covered by a valid claim within the Teikoku patent rights. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. 

Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently selling through partners or developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product portfolio in our target commercial markets. 

Government Regulation 

FDA Approval Process 

I n the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#8226; 

completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's current good laboratory practice ("cGLP") regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 

&#8226; 

approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices ("cGCP") to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA's cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted. 

The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, 

early evidence on effectiveness. 

Phase 2: Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. 

Phase 3: Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA's goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. 

The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") program to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS program is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug's risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS program can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. 

Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy, 

and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms. 

Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA") which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. A growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. 

The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 

ANDA Approval Process 

The Hatch-Waxman Act, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and 

effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials. 

505(b)(2) NDAs 

As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Orange Book Listing 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 

If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 

Non-Patent Exclusivity 

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An "active moiety" is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacological action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. 

A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. 

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 

The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. 

International Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

In the European Union ("EU"), we may seek marketing authorization under either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency ("EMA") implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of marketing exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS and its various enforcement divisions, such as CMS, the Office of Inspector General ("OIG"), the Office for Human Research Protections ("OHRP"), and the Office of Research Integrity ("ORI"), state Attorneys General, state Medicaid Fraud Control Units, or MFCUs, and other state and local government agencies. Healthcare laws and regulations that may govern our business include the following. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing, ordering or furnishing of a good, facility, item, or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term "remuneration" expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA"), among other things, amended the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The ACA also provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Further, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. 

Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The " qui tam " provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and potentially to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the federal civil False Claims Act. Many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. There are many potential bases for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, and improper promotion of off-label uses 

not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug's label. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity that is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person or entity knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. 

Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPPAA") created several additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, ACA amended certain of these federal criminal statutes to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain "covered entities," which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), which expanded certain of HIPAA's privacy and security standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to "payments or other transfers of value" made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally, applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to the CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. 

There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to health care professionals and health care entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of identifiable data. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, the U.S. 

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

The commercial success of our product portfolio, if and when approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product portfolio will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product portfolio will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and/or similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. The market for our product portfolio will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. 

Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Further, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. The cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience continued pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and administrative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative and administrative reforms. 

Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product portfolio and to operate profitably. 

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payors' reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 

Healthcare Reform 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that will likely affect our future operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve access, and improve quality. 

By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which is significantly changing health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry include, among others, the following: 

&#8226; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 

&#8226; 

an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively; 

&#8226; 

new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and for drugs that are line extension products; 

&#8226; 

a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#8226; 

extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program; 

&#8226; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#8226; 

expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 

&#8226; 

expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; 

&#8226; 

a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; 

&#8226; 

a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#8226; 

new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and, 

&#8226; 

a new requirement to annually report certain drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners, or to pharmacies of hospitals or other healthcare entities. 

We are still unsure of the full impact that the ACA will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect that there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future. 

Other healthcare legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 

In addition, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers subject to this federal law will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, in January 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the manner in which the &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. Any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business and/or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product portfolio or additional pricing pressures. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability 

to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 41 full-time employees in the United States, two part-time employees in the United States, and two full-time consultants in India. Of these 41 full-time employees, twelve were in research and development, eleven were in regulatory affairs and quality control compliance, three were in sales and marketing, seven were in administration and eight were in finance. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
