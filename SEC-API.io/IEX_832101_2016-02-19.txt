 Item 1. 

Business. 

IDEX Corporation (&#8220;IDEX,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on September 24, 1987. The Company is an applied solutions business that sells an extensive array of pumps, flow meters and other fluidics systems and components and engineered products to customers in a variety of markets around the world. All of the Company&#8217;s business activities are carried out through wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

The Company has three reportable business segments: Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies (&#8220;FMT&#8221;), Health &#38; Science Technologies (&#8220;HST&#8221;) and Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products (&#8220;FSDP&#8221;). Within our three reportable segments, the Company maintains fifteen platforms, where we focus on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Each of our fifteen platforms is also a reporting unit, where we annually test for goodwill impairment. 

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company announced the appointment of Eric Ashleman as Chief Operating Officer. While there were no changes to the reportable segments or movement of businesses between the reportable segments, the Company no longer delineates between &#8220;platforms&#8221; and &#8220;groups&#8221; and made the following changes to how certain businesses are managed internally: 

&#8226; 

Created the Valves platform as a result of the Alfa Valvole acquisition in June 2015. 

&#8226; 

Eliminated the Diaphragm and Dosing Pump Technology (&#8220;DDPT&#8221;) platform. 

&#8226; 

Created the Industrial platform from the businesses previously reported within Chemical, Food &#38; Process (Richter, Viking, and Aegis) plus the Warren Rupp and Trebor businesses from DDPT. 

&#8226; 

Created the Water platform from the businesses previously reported within Water Services &#38; Technology (ADS, IETG, and iPEK) plus the Pulsafeeder and Knight businesses from DDPT. 

The Fluid &#38; Metering Technologies segment contains the Energy (comprised of Corken, Faure Herman, Liquid Controls, SAMPI and Toptech), Valves (comprised of Alfa Valvole), Water (comprised of Pulsafeeder, Knight, ADS, IETG, and iPEK), Industrial (comprised of Richter, Viking, Aegis, Warren Rupp, and Trebor), and Agriculture (comprised of Banjo) platforms. The Health &#38; Science Technologies segment contains the Scientific Fluidics (comprised of Eastern Plastics, Rheodyne, Sapphire Engineering, Upchurch Scientific, ERC, and CiDRA Precision Services), IDEX Optics &#38; Photonics (comprised of CVI Melles Griot, Semrock, and AT Films), Sealing Solutions (comprised of Precision Polymer Engineering, FTL Seals Technology, and Novotema), Gast, Micropump, and Material Processing Technologies (comprised of Quadro, Fitzpatrick, Microfluidics, and Matcon) platforms. The Fire &#38; Safety/Diversified Products segment is comprised of the Fire Suppression (comprised of Class 1, Hale and Godiva), Rescue (comprised of Dinglee, Hurst Jaws of Life, Lukas, and Vetter), Band-It, and Dispensing platforms.
