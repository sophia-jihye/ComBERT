Kaplan Higher Education 

Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) provides a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals. 

In 2015 , Kaplan&#8217;s U.S.-based KHE division included the following businesses: Kaplan University and KHE Campuses. On September 3, 2015, Kaplan sold substantially all of the assets of its KHE Campuses business to Education Corporation of America (ECA), consisting of 38 nationally accredited ground campuses and certain related assets, in exchange for a preferred equity interest in ECA. Kaplan&#8217;s Bauder College campus in Atlanta and Mount Washington College in New Hampshire were not part of this sale, however, these schools ceased enrollment in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and are expected to be fully closed in 2016, following the teach-out of current students. As a result, the KHE segment currently consists primarily of Kaplan University. 

Kaplan University. &#160; &#32; Kaplan University specializes in online education, is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (HLC), a regional accreditor approved by the U.S. Secretary of Education, and holds other programmatic accreditations. Most of Kaplan University&#8217;s programs are offered online, while some are offered in a traditional classroom format at 14 campuses in Iowa, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska and Wisconsin and a Kaplan University Learning Center in Maryland. Kaplan University also includes Concord Law School, a fully online law school. At year-end 2015 , Kaplan University had approximately 33,000 students enrolled in online programs and approximately 6,800 students enrolled in its classroom-based programs. 

Also residing within Kaplan University is the School of Professional and Continuing Education (PACE). PACE offers a wide range of education solutions to assist professionals in advancing their careers by obtaining professional licenses, designations and certifications. This includes solutions for insurance, securities, mortgage and appraisal licensing exams and for advanced designations, such as CFA &#174; &#32;and CPA exams. PACE serves more than 3,200 

business-to-business clients, including more than 66 Fortune 500 companies. In 2015 , close to 500,000 students used PACE&#8217;s exam preparation offerings.

Financial Aid Programs and Regulatory Environment 

Funds provided under the U.S. Federal student financial aid programs that have been created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Higher Education Act), historically have been responsible for a majority of KHE revenues. During 2015 , funds received under Title IV programs accounted for approximately $628 million, or approximately 74%, of total KHE revenues, and 32.6% of Kaplan, Inc. revenues. The Company estimates that funds received from students borrowing under third-party private loan programs comprised approximately 0.3% of KHE revenues. Direct student payments, funds received under various state and federal agency grant programs and corporate reimbursement under tuition assistance programs accounted for most of the remaining 2015 &#32;KHE revenues. The significant role of Title IV funding in the operations of KHE is expected to continue. 

Title IV programs encompass various forms of student loans and non-repayable grants. In some cases, the U.S. Federal government subsidizes a portion of the student interest expense of Title IV loans. Subsidized loans and grants are only available to students who can demonstrate financial need. During 2015 , about 81.5% of the approximate $628 million of Title IV funds received by KHE came from student loans, and approximately 18.5% of such funds came from grants. 

Title IV Eligibility and Compliance With Title IV Program Requirements. &#32;&#32; To maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, a school must comply with extensive statutory and regulatory requirements relating to its financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, administrative capability, compensation practices, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made to current and prospective students, and various other matters. In addition, the school must be licensed, or otherwise legally authorized, to offer postsecondary educational programs by the appropriate governmental body in the state or states in which it is physically located or is otherwise subject to state authorization requirements, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and be certified to participate in the Title IV programs by the ED. Schools are required periodically to apply for renewal of their authorization, accreditation or certification with the applicable state governmental bodies, accrediting agencies and the ED. In accordance with ED regulations, our campuses are grouped into institutions consisting of a main campus and, if applicable, additional campus locations. In turn, each overall institution is assigned its own identification number, known as an OPEID number for the purpose of determining compliance with certain Title IV requirements. As a result, as of the end of 2015, the schools in KHE consist of a total of three institutions or OPEID numbers. No assurance can be given that our institutions or their 

individual programs will maintain their Title IV eligibility, accreditation and state authorization in the future or that the ED might not successfully assert that one or more of the institutions has previously failed to comply with Title IV requirements. 

The ED may place a school on provisional certification status under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, failure to satisfy certain standards of financial responsibility or administrative capability, or upon a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. Provisional certification status carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, the ED may withdraw an institution&#8217;s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. In addition, the ED may subject an institution on provisional certification status to greater scrutiny in some instances, for example, when it applies for approval to add a new location or program or makes another substantive program change. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution. On December 17, 2015, Kaplan University received notice from the ED that it had been placed on provisional certification status until September 30, 2018, in connection with an open and ongoing ED program review. The ED has not notified Kaplan University of any negative findings. However, at this time we cannot predict the outcome of the program review. During the period of provisional certification, Kaplan University must obtain prior ED approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change. 

In addition, if the ED finds that a school has failed to comply with Title IV requirements or improperly disbursed or retained Title IV program funds, it may take one or more of a number of actions, including fining the school, requiring the school to repay Title IV program funds, limiting or terminating the school&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, initiating an emergency action to suspend the school&#8217;s participation in the Title IV programs without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing, transferring the school to a method of Title IV payment that would adversely affect the timing of the institution&#8217;s receipt of Title IV funds, requiring the submission of a letter of credit, denying or refusing to consider the school&#8217;s application for renewal of its certification to participate in the Title IV programs or for approval to add a new campus or educational program and referring the matter for possible civil or criminal investigation. There can be no assurance that the ED will not take any of these or other actions in the future, whether as a result of a lawsuit, program review or otherwise. This list is not exhaustive. There may be other actions the ED may take and other legal theories under which a school could be sued as a result of alleged irregularities in the administration of student financial aid. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including Failure to Comply With Statutory and Regulatory Requirements Could Result in Loss of Access to U.S. Federal Student Loans and Grants Under Title IV, a Requirement to Pay Fines or Monetary Liabilities or Other Sanctions. &#32; &#160; 

Student Default Rates. &#160; &#32; A school may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if student defaults on the repayment of Title IV loans exceed specified rates, referred to as &#8220;cohort default rates.&#8221; The ED calculates a cohort default rate for each OPEID number. Kaplan University will be the only OPEID unit that will be continuing operations through 2016. If a school &#8217; s cohort default rate exceeds 40% for any single year, it will lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan programs for at least two fiscal years, effective 30 days after notification from the ED. If a school &#8217; s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, it will lose its Title IV eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan and U.S. Federal Pell Grant programs effective 30 days after notification from the ED and will remain ineligible for at least two fiscal years. If a school &#8217; s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% in two of the three most recent fiscal years for which rates have been issued by the ED, it may be placed on provisional certification by the ED. 

The three-year cohort default rates for Kaplan University, the only OPEID unit that will be continuing operation through the end of 2016, for the U.S. Federal fiscal years ending September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, were 12.9%, 20.4% and 26.2%, respectively. 

Because KHE receives a significantly lower level of taxpayer-funded grants and subsidies than community colleges, state schools and not-for-profit schools, KHE&#8217;s schools are more dependent on tuition, and its students are more dependent on loans. 

Kaplan has dedicated resources to help students who are at risk of default. Kaplan personnel contact students and provide assistance, which includes providing students with specific loan repayment information, lender contact information and debt counseling. Kaplan has also implemented a financial literacy and counseling program for current students and provides career counseling services. In addition, Kaplan implemented the Kaplan Commitment program in 2010, which provides first-time undergraduate students with a risk-free trial period. Students who withdraw or are subject to dismissal during the risk-free trial period do not incur any significant financial obligation. However, no assurances can be given that these resources or programs will enable Kaplan&#8217;s schools to maintain cohort default rates below the thresholds for sanctions. 

Recent Federal Rulemaking 

New Regulatory Initiative. In August 2015, the ED announced its intent to begin a new regulatory initiative to determine the acts or omissions by a postsecondary institution that may be used by a borrower as a defense to repayment of certain Title IV loans and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the ED. In October 2015, the ED solicited nominees for negotiators to serve on a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations to address (1) the procedures to be used by a borrower to establish a defense to repayment; (2) the criteria that the ED will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment of Federal Direct Loans, including the creation of a Federal standard; (3) the standards and procedures that the ED will use to determine the liability of the institution for amounts based on borrower defenses; (4) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments; and (5) other loan discharges. In addition, the committee may also consider if and how these issues will affect loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The negotiated rulemaking committee began a series of meetings in January 2016 that are expected to conclude in the spring of 2016. The ED is expected to publish proposed regulations that would be subject to notice and public comment and to publish final regulations by November 2016 that would take effect the following year. The regulations could include provisions that result in standards and procedures for determining institutional liabilities for discharged loans and for imposing other sanctions on institutions. The Company cannot predict the ultimate scope and content of the regulations, nor can it predict their impact on KHE. 

Final Regulations. In 2015, the ED issued final regulations that focused on Program Integrity and Improvement requirements in the following areas: 

&#8226; 

Cash management of funds provided under the Title IV Federal student aid programs, including the use of debit cards and the handling of Title IV credit balances; 

&#8226; 

Clock to credit-hour conversion; 

&#8226; 

Books and supplies; and 

&#8226; 

The application of the repeat coursework provisions to graduate and undergraduate programs. 

Gainful Employment . Under the Higher Education Act, certain education programs are required to lead to gainful employment (GE) in a recognized occupation in order to be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs. In June 2011, the ED issued final regulations that tie an education program&#8217;s Title IV eligibility to whether the program leads to gainful employment. On June 30, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated most of these final regulations. 

The ED convened a negotiated rulemaking committee in September 2013 to develop new proposed GE regulations. The final regulations were released on October 31, 2014, and generally became effective July 1, 2015. Among other requirements, each program subject to the GE regulations must meet one of two debt-to-earnings rates, which compare Title IV-aided graduates&#8217; payments on debt incurred to attend the program to their annual earnings and discretionary income as defined and calculated in the regulations. The ED will calculate the debt-to-earnings rates using income information obtained from the Social Security Administration, federal Title IV loan debt information gathered from its own records and private loan and institutional debt data provided by schools. If a program&#8217;s graduates&#8217; median debt payments exceed 8% of the graduates&#8217; mean and median annual earnings and 20% of the graduates&#8217; mean and median discretionary income, the program will be placed on a warning status (referred to by the ED as &#8220;zone&#8221; status). If a program&#8217;s graduates&#8217; median debt payments exceed 12% of the graduates&#8217; mean and median annual earnings and 30% of the graduates&#8217; mean and median discretionary income, the program will fail the debt-to-earnings rates metric. If a program fails the test two times within three years, it will become ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs for a period of three years. If a program fails the test or is in the zone for four consecutive years, it will become ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs for a period of three years. In addition, the regulation requires an institution to provide to current and prospective students prescribed warnings of the potential ineligibility of the program in any year for which the program could become ineligible based on a rate for the next year that is in the zone or failing. 

The regulations also include revised requirements for public disclosure of program information and certain outcomes (including graduation, placement, and repayment rates, and other consumer information); these new disclosure requirements take effect on January 1, 2017. Until such time, schools must continue to make disclosures pursuant to the disclosure provisions of the June 2011 final regulations, which remain in effect. The regulations also contain reporting requirements under which schools must annually provide the ED with certain information needed to compute the debt-to-earnings rates and several of the other disclosure elements. On October 9, 2015, Kaplan University received a letter from the ED indicating that it had failed to report data on a significant number of programs that were listed as active in the ED&#8217;s system. The letter stated that until the issue is resolved, Kaplan University cannot start any new programs and failure to resolve the issue could result in material administrative actions. Kaplan University has corrected the issue, but no assurances can be made that the ED will accept those corrections, will not find additional issues or will not take further action against Kaplan University. 

In addition, the regulations include a &#8220;certification&#8221; requirement that each program subject to the regulations (i) be approved by an accrediting agency recognized by the ED, (ii) have programmatic accreditation if required by a governmental entity in a state in which the school is located or otherwise required to obtain state authorization under ED&#8217;s regulations, and (iii) for each state in which the school is located or otherwise required to obtain state authorization under the ED&#8217;s regulations, meet applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in such state(s) so that graduates qualify to take any licensure or certification exam that is needed for such graduates to practice or find employment in such state(s) in an occupation that the program prepares graduates to enter. In addition, a school will be required to certify that any new Title IV-eligible education program it establishes is not &#8220;substantially similar&#8221; (as defined in the GE regulations) to a program that is ineligible under the regulations. This &#8220;certification&#8221; requirement has had a material negative impact on Kaplan University&#8217;s Concord Law School&#8217;s Juris Doctor program, which accounted for less than 1% of KHE&#8217;s 2015 revenue. Because it is completely online, that program does not have accreditation necessary to allow graduates to become licensed to practice law upon graduation and qualify to take the bar exam in any state other than California. Accordingly, because the ED has not provided guidance that narrows the rule as written, in 2015 Concord Law School was required to cease enrollments in multiple states. Changes in the state authorization law, discussed below, may extend the certification requirement to other states and further impact our schools. 

Some of the data needed to compute the debt-to-earnings rates and project their impact on program eligibility under the GE regulations are not accessible to the Company, including graduate earnings information that will be compiled by the Social Security Administration. In addition, the continuing eligibility of programs for Title IV funding may be affected by factors beyond Kaplan&#8217;s control, such as changes in the actual or deemed earnings level of its graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the U.S. Federal poverty income level relevant for calculating one of the proposed debt-to-earnings rates and other factors. As a result, the ultimate outcome of the GE regulations and their impact on Kaplan&#8217;s operations are still uncertain. Kaplan is continuing efforts to mitigate the potential negative impact of GE. These efforts include increasing career services support, implementing financial literacy counseling, creating program-specific tuition reductions and scholarships and revising the pricing model to implement a tuition cap for at-risk programs. Although Kaplan is taking these and other steps to address compliance with GE regulations, there can be no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to prevent a material number of programs from either failing the debt-to-earnings rates or being put on warning status. This has caused Kaplan to eliminate or limit enrollments in certain educational programs at some or all of its schools; may result in the loss of student access to Title IV programs; and has had a material adverse effect on KHE &#8217; s revenues, operating income, cash flows and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The ED has indicated that the first debt-to-earnings rates to be calculated under the new regulations are expected to be issued first in draft form later in 2016 and then in final form later in 2016 or in early 2017. 

Incentive Compensation . Under the incentive compensation rules as revised in 2011, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds. Kaplan has taken steps to comply fully with these rules and the related guidance. Among the actions taken, Kaplan revised its compensation plans for admissions personnel and eliminated enrollment results as a component in the determination of compensation. Kaplan believes that this change in its approach to recruiting has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, its enrollment rates, operating costs, business and results of operation. Kaplan cannot predict how the ED will interpret and enforce all aspects of the revised incentive compensation rule in the future. 

The 90/10 Rule. &#160; Under regulations referred to as the 90/10 rule, an institution would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs for a period of at least two fiscal years if the institution derives more than 90% of its receipts from Title IV programs, as calculated on a cash basis in accordance with the Higher Education Act and applicable ED regulations, in each of two consecutive fiscal years. An institution with Title IV receipts exceeding 90% for a single fiscal year would be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. Kaplan University derived less than 79% and less than 81% of its receipts from Title IV programs in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

KHE is taking various measures to reduce the percentage of its receipts attributable to Title IV funds, including modifying student payment options; emphasizing direct-pay and employer-paid education programs; encouraging students to evaluate carefully the amount of their Title IV borrowing; eliminating some programs; cash-matching; and developing and offering additional non-Title IV-eligible certificate preparation, professional development and continuing education programs. Kaplan has taken steps to ensure that revenue from programs acquired by Kaplan University is eligible to be counted in that campus&#8217;s 90/10 calculation. However, there can be no guarantee that the ED will not challenge the inclusion of revenue from any acquired program in KHE&#8217;s 90/10 calculations or will not issue an interpretation of the 90/10 rule that would exclude such revenue from the calculation. There can be no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to prevent the 90/10 ratio at Kaplan University from exceeding 90% in the future. In addition, certain legislators have proposed amendments to the Higher Education Act that would lower the threshold percentage in the 90/10 rule to 85%, treat non-Title IV federal funds as Title IV funds in 

the 90/10 calculation and make other refinements to the calculation. If these proposals or similar laws or regulations are adopted, they would make it more difficult for KHE institutions to comply with the 90/10 rule. 

Change of Control. If an institution experiences a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies, accrediting agencies or the ED, the institution must seek the approval of the relevant agencies. An institution that undergoes a change of control, which may include a change of control of the institution&#8217;s parent corporation or other owners, must be reviewed and recertified by the ED and obtain approvals from certain state agencies and accrediting bodies, in some cases prior to the change of control. The standards pertaining to a change of control are not uniform and are subject to interpretation by the respective agencies. Certifications obtained from the ED following a change in control are granted on a provisional basis that permits the institution to continue participating in Title IV programs, but provides fewer procedural protections than full certifications. As a result, the ED may withdraw an institution&#8217;s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. In addition, the ED may subject an institution on provisional certification status to greater scrutiny in some instances, for example, when it applies for approval to add a new location or program or makes another substantive change. 

Standards of Financial Responsibility. An institution participating in Title IV programs must maintain a certain level of financial responsibility as determined under the Higher Education Act and under ED regulations. The ED measures an institution&#8217;s financial responsibility by compiling a composite score, ranging from -0.1 to 3.0, pursuant to a formula that incorporates various financial data from annual financial statements submitted to the ED. If an institution fails to achieve a composite score of at least 1.5 or fails to comply with other financial responsibility standards, the ED may place conditions on the institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs, impose monitoring and reporting requirements, transfer the institution from the advance system of Title IV payment to a heightened cash-monitoring or reimbursement system of payment, and may require the institution to submit to the ED a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of the institution&#8217;s annual Title IV program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year, although the ED could require a letter of credit based on a higher percentage than 50% of the total Title IV program funds. The ED historically has evaluated the financial responsibility of the KHE institutions based on the financial results of KHE. For the 2015 fiscal year, Kaplan expects KHE to have a composite score of 2.97, based on its own assessment using ED methodology. However, the ED will make its determination once it receives and reviews KHE&#8217;s audited financial statements for the 2015 &#32;fiscal year. 

Administrative Capability. The Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, directs the ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause the ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and subject the institution to additional scrutiny, deny eligibility for Title IV programs or impose other sanctions. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements; 

&#8226; 

Have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs; 

&#8226; 

Have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; 

&#8226; 

Have procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records; 

&#8226; 

Administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal control over financial reporting; 

&#8226; 

Not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from U.S. Federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; 

&#8226; 

Provide adequate financial aid counseling to its students; 

&#8226; 

Refer to the ED&#8217;s Office of the Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; 

&#8226; 

Submit in a timely way all required reports and financial statements; and 

&#8226; 

Not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. 

Although Kaplan endeavors to comply with the administrative capability requirements, Kaplan cannot guarantee that it will continue to comply with the administrative capability requirements or that its interpretation or application of the relevant rules will be upheld by the ED or other agencies or upon judicial review. 

State Authorization. Kaplan&#8217;s institutions and programs are subject to state-level regulation and oversight by state licensing agencies, whose approval is necessary to allow an institution to operate and grant degrees or diplomas in the state. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, financial policies and responsibility and other operational matters. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be legally authorized to operate in the state in which the institution is physically located or is otherwise subject to state authorization requirements. 

Some states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that offer education services to residents in the state or to institutions that advertise or recruit in the state, notwithstanding the lack of a physical location in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. If KHE is found not to be in compliance with an applicable state regulation and a state seeks to restrict one or more of KHE&#8217;s business activities within its boundaries, KHE may not be able to recruit or enroll students in that state and may have to cease providing services in that state. 

The ED regulations that became effective on July 1, 2011, expanded the requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized in the state in which it is physically located for Title IV purposes. In some cases, the regulations required states to revise their current requirements and/or to license schools in order for institutions to be deemed legally authorized in those states and, in turn, to participate in the Title IV programs. If a state&#8217;s requirements are found not to be in compliance with these ED regulations or if KHE institutions do not receive state approvals where necessary, the institutions could be deemed to lack the state authorization necessary to participate in the Title IV programs and be subject to loss of Title IV eligibility, repayment obligations and other sanctions. Due to an exemption, Kaplan University&#8217;s home state of Iowa does not require Kaplan University to be registered in Iowa. However, to comply with the law, Kaplan University was granted affirmative registration in Iowa. Kaplan believes that all of Kaplan University&#8217;s campuses currently meet the ED requirements to be considered legally authorized to provide the programs they offer in the states in which the campuses are located. The ED has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the state authorization requirements, and it is uncertain how the ED will interpret these requirements in each state. 

In addition, the ED regulations that took effect on July 1, 2011, required institutions offering postsecondary education to students through distance education in a state in which the institution is not physically located, or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, to meet any applicable state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state. In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the regulations with respect to distance education. Between February and May 2014, the ED convened a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations on a variety of topics that included state authorization for programs offered through distance education or correspondence education. The ED paused the negotiated rulemaking process without publishing new regulations on this topic. The ED may resume this process in the future and publish new distance-education state authorization requirements that may require Kaplan University to be registered in additional states. If Kaplan is unable to obtain the required approvals for distance-education programs, then Kaplan students residing in the state for which approval was not obtained may be unable to receive Title IV funds, which could have a material adverse effect on Kaplan&#8217;s business and operations. 

Congressional Reauthorization of Title IV Programs. &#32;All of the Title IV programs are subject to periodic legislative review and reauthorization. In addition, while Congress historically has not limited the amount of funding available for the various Title IV student loan programs, the availability of funding for the Title IV programs that provide for the payment of grants is primarily contingent upon the outcome of the annual U.S. Federal appropriations process. Congress also can make changes in the laws affecting Title IV programs in those annual appropriations bills and in other laws it enacts between Higher Education Act reauthorizations. The Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014 and has continued to receive annual appropriations. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP) and the House Education and the Workforce Committee have held a series of hearings on reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, but it is not known when Congress will make changes to that statute or to other laws affecting U.S. Federal student aid. 

Whether as a result of changes in the laws and regulations governing Title IV programs, a reduction in Title IV program funding levels or a failure of schools within KHE to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, a material reduction in the amount of Title IV financial assistance available to the students attending those schools could have a material adverse effect on Kaplan&#8217;s business and operations. In addition, any development that has the effect of making the terms on which Title IV financial assistance is made available materially less attractive could also have a material adverse effect on Kaplan&#8217;s business and operations. 

U.S. Senate Committee Review. &#160; In the summer of 2010, the Chairman of the HELP Committee commenced an industry-wide review of for-profit higher education institutions. The institutions owned and operated by KHE were included in the scope of this industry-wide review. In July 2012, the majority staff of the Committee issued a final report to conclude the review that included observations and recommendations for federal policy, but did not include or endorse any specific proposed legislation or regulations. 

Other committees of Congress have also held hearings addressing, among other things, the standards and procedures of accrediting agencies, credit hours and program length and the portion of U.S. Federal student financial aid going to for-profit institutions, and enrollment of active-duty military personnel and veterans. In addition, concerns generated by congressional or other activity or media reports may adversely affect enrollment in for-profit educational institutions. 

Kaplan cannot predict the extent to which these activities could result in further investigations, legislation or rulemaking affecting its participation in Title IV programs, other governmental actions and/or actions by state agencies or legislators or by accreditors. If any laws or regulations are adopted that significantly limit Kaplan&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs or the amount of student financial aid for which Kaplan&#8217;s students are eligible, Kaplan&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely and materially impacted. 

Program Reviews, Audits and Investigations. &#160; Kaplan&#8217;s schools are subject to audits or program compliance reviews by various external agencies, including the ED, its Office of the Inspector General, other federal agencies including the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and state accrediting agencies. While program reviews may be undertaken for a variety of reasons, they are performed routinely as part of regulatory oversight of institutions that participate in Title IV or federal or state student funding programs. If the ED or another regulatory agency determines that an institution has improperly disbursed Title IV or other federal or state program funds or violated a provision of the Higher Education Act or other federal or state law or regulations, the affected institution may be required to repay funds to the ED or the appropriate federal or state agency or lender and may be assessed an administrative fine and be subject to other sanctions. Although Kaplan endeavors to comply with all U.S. Federal and state laws and regulations, Kaplan cannot guarantee that its interpretation of the relevant rules will be upheld by the ED or other agencies or upon judicial review. 

On February 23, 2015, the ED began a review of Kaplan University. The review will assess Kaplan&#8217;s administration of its Title IV and Higher Education Act programs and will initially focus on the 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 award years. On December 17, 2015, Kaplan University received a notice from the ED that it had been placed on provisional certification status until September 30, 2018, in connection with the open and ongoing ED program review. The ED has not notified Kaplan University of any negative findings. However, at this time, Kaplan cannot predict the outcome of this review, when it will be completed or any liability or other limitations that the ED may place on Kaplan University as a result of this review. During the period of provisional certification, Kaplan University must obtain prior ED approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change. 

In addition, there are four open program reviews at campuses that were part of the KHE Campuses business, including the ED&#8217;s final reports on the program reviews at KHE&#8217;s Broomall, PA, and Pittsburgh, PA, locations. Kaplan retains responsibility for any financial obligation resulting from the ED program reviews at the KHE Campuses business that were open at the time of sale of the campuses to ECA. 

Institutional and Programmatic Accreditation. &#160; Accreditation is a process through which an institution submits itself to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Pursuant to the Higher Education Act, the ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether the academic quality of an institution&#8217;s educational programs is sufficient to qualify the institution to participate in Title IV programs. As noted previously, to remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain its institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ED. Kaplan&#8217;s schools are subject to reviews by the accrediting agencies that accredit them and their educational programs. Kaplan University&#8217;s regional accreditation by the HLC is required to be reaffirmed in 2016. As part of this process, in the second quarter of 2016, the HLC will conduct reaffirmation site visits at multiple Kaplan University campuses as well as a broad review of Kaplan University&#8217;s academics and policies. Although we cannot at this time predict the outcome of this process, Kaplan University expects this process to be complete by the end of 2016. 

Programmatic accreditation is the process through which specific programs are reviewed and approved by industry-specific and program-specific accrediting entities. Although programmatic accreditation is not generally necessary for Title IV eligibility, such accreditation may be required to allow students to sit for certain licensure exams or to work in a particular profession or career or to meet other requirements. Kaplan University programs maintain a variety of programmatic accreditations that KHE believes are appropriate to ensure the quality of the programs or to enable students to seek necessary credentials upon graduation. 

Return of Title IV Funds. &#160; ED regulations require schools participating in Title IV programs to calculate correctly and return on a timely basis unearned Title IV funds disbursed to students who withdraw from a program of study prior to completion. These funds must be returned in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under ED regulations, failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in a school&#8217;s annual compliance audit, or in a program review or Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audit, could result in a requirement that the school post a letter of credit in an amount equal to 25% of its prior-year returns of Title IV program funds. Currently, none of KHE&#8217;s schools is required to post a letter of credit. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution is subject to monetary liabilities, fines or other sanctions. 

Test Preparation 

In 2015 , Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) included test preparation businesses in pre-college, graduate, health and bar review, as well as new businesses in new economy skills training (NEST) and in career advising. KTP also published test preparation and other books through its Kaplan Publishing business. Each of these businesses is discussed below. 

Test Preparation. &#160; &#32; KTP&#8217;s pre-college and graduate businesses prepare students for a broad range of college and graduate school admissions examinations, including the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE. KTP&#8217;s health business prepares students for medical and nursing licensure exams, including the USMLE and NCLEX. Kaplan Bar Review offers full-service bar review in 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as review for the multistate portion of the bar exam nationwide. 

KTP delivers courses at numerous venues throughout the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico and London. These courses are taught at more than 70 KTP-branded locations and at numerous other locations such as hotels, high schools and universities. KTP also offers courses online, typically in a live online classroom or a self-study format. Private tutoring services are provided in person in select markets and online throughout the U.S. In addition, KTP licenses material for certain of its courses to third parties and to a Kaplan affiliate, which, during 2015, delivered courses at 31 locations in 50 countries outside the U.S. KTP also offers college admissions examination preparation courses and materials directly to high schools and school districts. 

During 2015, KTP enrolled over 360,000 students in its courses, including more than 155,000 enrolled in online programs. 

New Economy Skills Training. In 2015, KTP entered the NEST market in New York, California and Illinois with two offerings. The acquisition of Dev Bootcamp established KTP as a leader in software developer bootcamps, which are programs that provide students with job-ready computer coding skills. KTP also launched Metis, which offers data science and plans to offer marketing and other NEST programs . 

Publishing. &#160; &#32; Kaplan Publishing focuses on print test preparation resources sold through retail channels. At the end of 2015, Kaplan Publishing had close to 300 products available in print and digital formats, including more than 100 digital products. 

Kaplan International 

Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Each of these businesses is discussed below. 

Europe. &#160; &#32; In Europe, Kaplan International operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the U.K. and Ireland: Kaplan UK, Kaplan International Colleges (KIC) and a set of higher education institutions. 

The Kaplan UK business in Europe is a provider of training, test preparation services and degrees for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In addition, Kaplan UK provides professional training. In 2015 , Kaplan UK provided courses to over 48,500 students in accountancy and financial services. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 24 training centers located throughout the U.K. 

The KIC business comprises a university pathways business and an English-language training business. The university pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study in English-speaking countries. In 2015, university preparation programs were being delivered in Australia, China, Nigeria, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., serving 12,000 students in partnership with 44 universities. 

The English-language business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. KIC operates a total of 41 English-language schools, with 22 located in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and 19 located in the U.S., where they operate under the name Kaplan International Centers. During 2015 , the English-language business served approximately 53,500 students for in-class English-language instruction provided by Kaplan. 

Kaplan also operates two higher education institutions in Europe, located in the U.K. and Ireland. These institutions are Dublin Business School and Kaplan Open Learning. At the end of 2015 , these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 5,400 students. During 2015, Kaplan closed a higher education institution in Europe, Holborn College. 

Certain Kaplan International businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visa and Immigration Department (UKVI), KIC&#8217;s university pathways business and Kaplan Financial Limited are required to hold or operate Tier 4 sponsorship licenses to permit international students to come to the U.K. to study the courses they deliver. All of KIC&#8217;s UK English-language schools also have Tier 4 licenses to enable them to teach international students, although, in general, students studying the English language can choose to enter the U.K. on a student visitor visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa. 

Each Tier 4 license holder is also required to ensure that it has passed the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and holds Educational Oversight accreditation. Without these criteria being met, Kaplan International&#8217;s U.K. schools would not be permitted to issue a Confirmation for Acceptance of Studies (CAS) to potential incoming international students, which is a prerequisite to a student obtaining a Tier 4 student visa. The revised immigration rules also require all private institutions to obtain Educational Oversight accreditation. Educational Oversight requires a current and satisfactory full inspection, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. Failure to comply with these new rules has the potential to adversely impact the number of international students studying through Kaplan International. 

For Kaplan UK, Kaplan Financial Limited currently holds Tier 4 license status under a Kaplan master license enabling it to sponsor international students. Kaplan UK met the UKVI requirements throughout 2015. 

With respect to KIC&#8217;s businesses in the U.K., the pathways group of colleges continues to retain Tier 4 sponsor status and Educational Oversight accreditation, and all gained the status of &#8220;commendable progress&#8221; in the Quality Assurance Agency Educational Oversight Annual Monitoring. One of the most recent embedded pathways colleges within the University of the West of England, which obtained Educational Oversight in 2014, was granted a full Tier 4 sponsor license in 2015. The pathway colleges at the University of Brighton and Bournemouth University have also gained their own Tier 4 sponsor licenses. 

In April 2015, the UKVI replaced the previous requirement that each Tier 4 license holder have Highly Trusted Sponsor (HTS) status with one overall Tier 4 status requirement. Ten of the Kaplan colleges subsequently completed their Tier 4 renewal in 2015. With the restructuring of the Tier 4 licenses, the next Tier 4 renewal submissions will be due in July/August 2016, with one exception, the Pathway College in Brighton, whose renewal will be due in March 2016. 

All of the English-language schools presently have Tier 4 sponsor status and have completed annual monitoring achieving &#8220;extended expectations&#8221; from the Independent Schools Inspectorate. The Kaplan International English-language business is considering a consolidation of its Tier 4 licenses from June 2016 so that only four UK English-language schools will remain on the Kaplan Tier 4 master license. As noted above, students studying the English language can choose to enter the U.K. on a student visitor visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa. 

Changes continue to be made to U.K. immigration rules. The UKVI continues to tighten the regulations around sponsoring students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. Changes over the past three years have included the introduction of a rule that restricts to five years the time a sponsored student can spend studying at or above degree level in the U.K. The post-study work visa, which permitted postgraduate students to work in the U.K. without being sponsored, was closed to new applicants. In addition, sponsored students who do not attend an institution that qualifies as a Higher Educational Institution (HEI), which includes students attending Kaplan UK&#8217;s colleges, are no longer permitted to work part time while studying. In 2013, the biggest change was the introduction of a new screening process called a &#8220;Credibility Check&#8221; for potential students. This interview process can affect the number of visa refusals Kaplan International&#8217;s businesses receive, which is a risk factor for loss of the relevant license. However, Kaplan International has not experienced a significant increase in visa refusals. Since the introduction of the Points-Based System in 2009, all Tier 4 students are subject to strict checks pre and post arrival, including verification that their qualifications are genuine, confirmation that the students maintain a good attendance record and that they can be contacted at all times, and verification that they have academic progression and that their visa is valid at all times while they are present in the U.K. Failure to meet these requirements obliges Kaplan International to withdraw sponsorship and report these students to the UKVI. In 2014, there were additional changes to the UKVI rules, including a significant tightening of the core measurable with respect to visa refusals. Effective November 1, 2014, no more than 10% of the students to whom a CAS is issued by a Tier 4 license sponsor can have their visa refused. Formerly, the limit was set at 20%. In 2015, the Tier 4 licenses for Kaplan Financial, KIC&#8217;s London College and all of KI &#8217; s English-language colleges were consolidated into one single &#8220;master&#8221; license. If this license were lost, all of these colleges would lose the ability to sponsor international students. Furthermore, students applying to another education provider after completing their studies at these colleges are now required to return home to apply for a second visa. All of KI&#8217;s colleges dedicated to working with one university partner that held their own individual sponsor license before the introduction of the master license have retained their individual licenses. Academic service providers are required to have rigorous processes to verify 

all English-language test certificates. The introduction of revised immigration rules has negatively impacted Kaplan UK&#8217;s enrollment rate in relation to students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. 

No assurance can be given that each Kaplan International business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Tier 4 BCA status and Educational Oversight accreditation. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to attain. Loss of either Tier 4 BCA status or Educational Oversight accreditation would have a material adverse effect on Kaplan Europe&#8217;s operating results. 

In January 2016, Kaplan International acquired Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), a U.K. independent sixth-form college which prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that control admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. 

Asia Pacific. &#160; In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China. 

In Singapore, Kaplan operates three business units: Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional. During 2015, the Higher Education and Financial divisions served more than 20,000 students from Singapore and 4,000 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. Kaplan Professional provided short courses to approximately 21,000 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2015. 

Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn bachelor&#8217;s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs. 

Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Financial business provides preparatory courses for professional qualifications in accountancy and finance, such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Kaplan Singapore&#8217;s Professional business, which is an authorized Workforce Development Agency Continuing Education Training (CET) Centre, provides professionals with various skills training to help them rejoin the workforce, shift to new careers or catch up with changes that occur in the workplace. 

In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through master&#8217;s level together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, hospitality and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2015 , these businesses provided courses to approximately 11,000 students through classroom programs and to more than 31,000 students through online or distance-learning programs. 

Kaplan Australia&#8217;s English-language business is part of KIC, which operates across seven locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, teaching more than 7,000 students per year. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KIC. It consists of Murdoch Institute of Technology and Bradford College and offers pathways and foundational education to approximately 1,200 students wishing to enter Murdoch University in Perth and the University of Adelaide, respectively. 

In 2015, Kaplan sold its Franklyn Scholar business that offered a wide range of custom-developed programs to corporate clients at the vocational education level. 

In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving more than 9,000 students annually. 

Kaplan Hong Kong&#8217;s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to more than 7,000 students and business executives wishing to take professional qualifications in accountancy, including HKICPA, ACCA and CPA, and financial markets designations, including CFA, LE, FRM and CIAI. 

Hong Kong&#8217;s Language Training division offers both test preparation for overseas study and college applications including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 1,000 students. 

Kaplan Hong Kong Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to more than 1,000 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students gain doctorate, master&#8217;s and bachelor&#8217;s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through Kaplan Business and Accountancy School. 

In August 2014, Kaplan entered into an agreement in China to sell both its ACCA training programs business and four schools that deliver university preparation programs. Final local transfer mechanics were completed in January 2015. Kaplan continues to retain franchise arrangements with third parties in China to deliver programs. 

In June 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties have now incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan 

CITIC Education Co. Limited, which is 49% owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company will undertake training consultancy and related businesses in China. 

Each of Kaplan&#8217;s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate. The degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions, which can make compliance challenging. No assurance can be given that Kaplan will be able to comply with foreign regulations, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect Kaplan &#8217; s operating results.

(a) Source: 2015/2016 DMA Market Rankings, Nielsen Media Research, fall 2015, based on television homes in DMA (see note (b) below). 

(b) Designated Market Area (DMA) is a market designation of A.C. Nielsen that defines each television market exclusive of another, based on measured viewing patterns. 

Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2015 , advertising revenue accounted for 77% of the total for GMG&#8217;s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station&#8217;s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for air time; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends among others. 

Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters 

GMG&#8217;s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period. 

Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues. &#160; Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) now broadcasts only in digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming, multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting) and subchannels of programming designed for reception by mobile devices (mobile DTV). 

Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers&#8217; ability to receive television stations&#8217; signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC&#8217;s decision to allow electronic devices, known as &#8220;white space&#8221; devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. 

Congress has authorized reallocation of spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers, including substantial amounts of spectrum currently in the television broadcast band. Congress has authorized incentive auctions whereby the FCC would auction spectrum relinquished by broadcast television stations in exchange for a share of the auction revenues. The FCC has adopted rules, and is expected to continue adopting rules, addressing, among other things, how the incentive auction process will work and how the FCC will conduct a &#8220;repacking,&#8221; whereby the FCC will require certain stations to move to new channel allotments so as to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The repacking and incentive auction processes are subject to certain requirements established by Congress in legislation enacted in February 2012. The incentive auction is currently scheduled to begin in March 2016. On January 12, 2016, stations wishing to remain eligible to bid to relinquish some or all of their current spectrum rights must submit their initial applications to the FCC. On the same date, a &#8220;quiet period&#8221; established by the FCC &#8217; s auction anti-collusion rules goes into effect and continues until the FCC publicly announces the results of the incentive auction. During this quiet period, broadcast television licensees eligible to participate in the reverse-auction phase of the incentive auction may not directly or indirectly communicate with 

each other or with forward-auction applicants regarding licensees &#8217; &#32;bids or bidding strategies. The repacking and incentive auction processes could have an adverse effect on GMG. For example, a repacking could result in GMG stations having smaller service areas and/or receiving more interference than they do currently. Stations moving to new channels also could incur significant expense. The legislation requires that stations be compensated for the expenses of moving to a new channel from spectrum auction proceeds, from a $1.75 billion reimbursement fund. The Company cannot predict what effect a repacking will have on the GMG stations&#8217; coverage or whether the GMG stations will be fully compensated for expenses that they incur in connection with a repacking. 

Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals. &#160; The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station&#8217;s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forego must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a &#8220;retransmission consent&#8221; agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on DBS systems that choose to provide &#8220;local-into-local&#8221; service (i.e., to distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). 

Stations that elect retransmission consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG&#8217;s television stations is being carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station&#8217;s respective local market, pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. 

In March 2011, the FCC initiated a rulemaking seeking comments on changes to the FCC&#8217;s retransmission consent and exclusivity rules, many of which had been proposed by cable and DBS operators, such as authorization for &#8220;interim carriage&#8221; of a broadcaster&#8217;s signal by cable and DBS operators after the broadcaster&#8217;s grant of retransmission consent has expired. Broadcasters opposed many of the proposed rule changes. In March 2014, the FCC adopted a rule prohibiting certain practices in the negotiation of retransmission consent agreements and seeking additional comments on possible changes to the exclusivity rules. In the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), enacted in December 2014, Congress directed the FCC to undertake additional rulemakings concerning retransmission consent issues. For example, the FCC has adopted new rules required by STELAR prohibiting same-market television broadcast stations from coordinating or jointly negotiating for retransmission consent unless such stations are under common control. The FCC also has commenced a rulemaking required by STELAR reviewing the Commission &#8217; s &#8220;totality of the circumstances&#8221; test for good faith retransmission consent negotiations. In addition, the FCC has solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. If such a proposal were adopted, cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDS) might be permitted to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicating programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. Further changes to the retransmission consent and/or exclusivity rules could materially affect the GMG stations&#8217; bargaining leverage in future retransmission consent negotiations, and the Company cannot predict the net effect that such an order would have. Congress may also pass additional legislation that would affect the must-carry/retransmission consent regime. 

Under STELAR, the statutory copyright license for satellite carriage of distant broadcast television signals was extended through December 31, 2019. The Company cannot predict whether this distant signal copyright will be extended again, nor can it predict whether or how Congress may otherwise change the communications or copyright regimes. The net effect that changes to these regimes would have on the Company&#8217;s broadcast operations, or on the Company overall, cannot be predicted. 

Ownership Limits. &#160; The Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. Among other restrictions, the FCC&#8217;s local television ownership rule generally prohibits one company from owning two television stations in the same market unless there would remain at least eight independently owned full-power television stations in that market, and at least one of the commonly owned stations is not among the top-four-ranked television stations in that market. In addition, by statute, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as the interest complies with the FCC&#8217;s other ownership restrictions. In April 2014, the Commission released a report and order determining that certain television joint sales agreements (JSAs) are attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 through September 30, 2025, the new JSA attribution standard will not apply to JSAs that were in effect as of March 31, 2014, and any party to such a JSA will not be considered in violation of the FCC&#8217;s ownership rules by reason of the application of the new JSA attribution standard. GMG stations are not parties to JSAs, but the FCC &#8217; s rule change could limit GMG&#8217;s ability to enter into possible transactions in the future. 

The FCC also restricts so-called &#8220;cross-ownership&#8221; of newspapers and broadcast stations within a market. 

In April 2014, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking, proposing to retain the local television ownership rule, seeking comment on a possible waiver standard for smaller markets and proposing a modest relaxation of the 

newspaper/broadcast rule. The notice also addresses the FCC&#8217;s radio ownership and radio/television cross-ownership rules, and it asks whether the FCC should require disclosure of shared service agreements. The proceeding is pending, and it is not possible to predict its outcome or ramifications. 

Separately, in March 2014, the FCC released a Public Notice, characterized as &#8220;guidance,&#8221; that the FCC will &#8220;closely scrutinize&#8221; any transaction that involves both a sharing agreement and certain kinds of financial interests. 

Programming. &#160; Four of GMG&#8217;s five stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks, which provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of these affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of the Television Broadcasting section. GMG&#8217;s Jacksonville station, WJXT, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the Company&#8217;s stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG&#8217;s performance depends, in part, on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect GMG&#8217;s operations. 

Public Interest Obligations. &#160; To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children&#8217;s programming. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children&#8217;s programs. 

In April 2012, the FCC adopted a rule that requires television stations to submit electronically most of their public inspection files to the FCC for hosting on the FCC &#8217; s website. Compliance with the rule, which has taken effect, could affect GMG&#8217;s operations and regulatory compliance costs. 

The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the Internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG&#8217;s operations. 

Political Advertising. &#160; The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG&#8217;s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG&#8217;s television stations during the periods preceding elections. 

Broadcast Indecency. &#160; The FCC&#8217;s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC regularly imposes monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC&#8217;s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters&#8217; programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for &#8220;fleeting expletives&#8221; were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC&#8217;s authority to regulate broadcast decency. This ruling could result in additional regulatory risks. The FCC is currently reconsidering its indecency policies. 

The FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various matters in addition to those described in this section. The outcome of these proceedings and other matters described in this section could adversely affect the profitability of GMG&#8217;s television broadcasting operations.

Competition 

Kaplan&#8217;s businesses operate in fragmented and competitive markets. KHE competes with both facilities-based and other distance-learning providers of similar educational services, including not-for-profit colleges and universities 

and for-profit businesses. PACE competes in each of its professional lines with other companies that provide preparation for exams required for professional licenses, certifications and designations. KTP competes with a variety of regional and national test preparation businesses, with individual tutors and with in-school preparation for standardized tests. Overseas, each of Kaplan&#8217;s businesses competes with other for-profit companies and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Students choose among providers based on program offerings, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost. 

GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems and video services offered by telephone companies serving the same or nearby areas; with DBS services; and, to a lesser degree, with other media, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company&#8217;s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on a pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. The Company&#8217;s television stations may also become subject to increased competition from low-power television stations, wireless cable services and satellite master antenna systems, which can carry pay-cable and similar program material. In addition, movies and television programming are available free of charge on the websites of the major TV networks, as well as on the advertising-supported website &#32; Hulu . 

The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and non-profit companies. Celtic and Residential compete primarily with privately owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers.
