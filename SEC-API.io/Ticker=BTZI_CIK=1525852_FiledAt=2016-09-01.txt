 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

General Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010 originally under the name Lifetech Industries, Inc. All agreements related to the Lifetech business were terminated and closed as of April 30, 2014. Effective August 2, 2013, the name was changed from "Lifetech Industries, Inc." to "mCig, Inc." The Company&#8217;s common stock is traded under the symbol &#8220;MCIG.&#8221; The Company is based in Beverly Hills, California. 

&#160;

Since 2013, the Company manufactures, markets, and distributes electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and accessories under the mCig brand name in the United States. It offers electronic cigarettes and related products through its online store mcig.org, as well as through the company&#8217;s wholesale, distributor, and retail programs. In FY 2016 the Company expanded its products and services to include construction management. The Company continues to look at strategic acquisitions and product and service developments for future growth. 

mCig Construction Division 

We develop, design, engineer, and construct modular buildings with unique and proprietary elements that assist cannabis growers in the market. Each modular building is uniquely designed for each customer. The Company began construction on its first contract in April 2016. We will continue to expand our offering in the construction and modular facilities in multiple facets as the industry continues to seek better and improved ways of production. 

mCig Commercial Division 

We manufacture, distribute, and retail the mCig &#8211; an affordable loose-leaf eCig. Designed in the USA &#8211; the mCig provides a smoking experience by heating plant material, waxes, and oils delivering, in the Company&#8217;s opinion, a smoother inhalation experience. The Company also maintains an investment in Vapolution, Inc. which manufactures and retails home-use vaporizers such as the Vapolution 2.0. Through VitaCig, Inc., a Florida Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Company is engaged in the manufacturing and retailing of a nicotine-free eCig that delivers a water-vapor mixed with vitamins and natural flavors. DESCRIPTION OF SUBSIDIARIES 

Scalable Solutions, LLC 

The Company organized Scalable Solutions, LLC (&#8220;SS&#8221;) on March 7, 2016 under the laws of the state of Nevada. mCig has been issued 40 membership units and Zoha Development, LLC (&#8220;ZOHA&#8221;) has been issued 20 units. ZOHA has a ten year option to purchase 40 additional units which expires March 6, 2026. 

mCig Internet Sales, Inc. 

On June 1, 2016, subsequent to this reporting period, the Company incorporated mCig Internet Sales, Inc., (&#8220;mCig Internet&#8221;) in order to consolidate all online retail sales from various websites and to provide streamlining of administrative and documentation services, consolidation of inventories, and support economy of scale. 

&#160;

Vapolution, Inc. 

&#160;

On January 23, 2014, the Company signed a Stock Purchase Agreement with Vapolution, Inc. which manufactures and retails home-use vaporizers. In accordance with this agreement, mCig, Inc. acquired 100% of Vapolution, Inc. As part of this transaction, mCig, Inc. issued 5,000,000 shares to shareholders of Vapolution, Inc. The shareholders of Vapolution, Inc. retained the right to rescind the transaction, which expired on January 23, 2015 but was extended to May 23, 2015 based on an Amended Stock Purchase Agreement executed on May 23, 2014. Subsequently, on August 25, 2015, the final payment to the shareholders of Vapolution as extended to September 30, 2015 and the right to rescind the transaction was extended to June 30, 2017. On April 30, 2015 the Company impaired the $625,000 initial investment into Vapolution, Inc., but maintains the $67,500 investment on its balance sheet. 

&#160;

On January 23, 2014, Paul Rosenberg, CEO of mCig, Inc. cancelled an equal amount (2,500,000 shares) of common shares owned by him resulting in a net non-dilutive transaction to existing mCig, Inc. shareholders. The remaining 2,500,000 of common shares owned by Paul Rosenberg were cancelled to offset the 2,500,000 new shares issued from the treasury to complete the purchase of Vapolution, Inc. 

&#160;

Vapolution, Inc., is wholly owned by mCig, Inc., and is reported in the consolidated financial statements as an investment of the Company. The financial statements of Vapolution, Inc. are not consolidated with the consolidated financial performance of mCig as expressed in this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

VitaCig, Inc. 

&#160;

On February 24, 2014, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement with VitaCig, Inc. In accordance with this agreement, VitaCig, Inc. accepted the contribution by mCig, Inc. of specific assets consisting solely of pending trademarks for the term &#8220;VitaCig&#8221; filed with the USPTO and $500 in cash as contribution in exchange for 500,135,000 shares of common capital stock representing 100% of the shares outstanding of VitaCig, Inc. mCig now owns approximately 46% of VitaCig shares. 

&#160;

On November 28, 2014, mCig completed the spin-off of VitaCig, Inc. (the &#8220;Spin-off&#8221;). Effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on November 28, 2014 (the &#8220;Distribution Date&#8221;), the Company distributed 270,135,000 shares of common stock of VitaCig, Inc., par value $0.0001 per share (&#8220;VitaCig Common Stock&#8221;), to holders of mCig&#8217;s stockholders of record as a pro rata dividend. The record date for the dividend was November 28, 2014. The Ex-Dividend Date was set for November 25, 2014. mCig stockholders received one share of VitaCig Common Stock for every one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of mCig. The Spin-off was completed for the purpose of legally and structurally separating VitaCig, Inc. from mCig. MCig retained 230,000,000 shares of common stock and remains a shareholder. The shares of common stock to be received by mCig shareholders were registered on a Form S-1 filed by VitaCig and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 2014. 

&#160;

On June 2 2 , 2016, the Company and VitaCig, Inc., entered into a Separation and Share Transfer Agreement whereby VitaCig transferred the assets and operations of the business of VitaCig, Inc., to Company in exchange for the return of 172,500,000 shares of VitaCig Common Stock to the treasury of VitaCig, Inc., and for a reduction of the amount owed to the Company in excess of $95,000. 

&#160;

VitaCig, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, is a public company trading under VTCQ. 

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

mCig specializes in products and services within the cannabis and eCig markets. Since October 2013, mCig, Inc. has positioned itself as an industry leader and technology company focused on two long-term secular trends: 

&#160;

(1) The decriminalization and legalization of marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes. L egalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana usage is steadily on the rise not only domestically but also internationally. Marijuana has been decriminalized in over twenty countries, in over five continents. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form (See http://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html, which website is not incorporated into this filing). &#160; 

&#160;

(2) The adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as &#8220;eCigs&#8221;), as smokers move away from traditional cigarettes onto e-cigarettes. Smoking tobacco causes numerous health problems, including disease and death. Smoking is addictive, and the most difficult part is cessation. The Company contends that E-cigarettes offer a safer and healthier alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. E-cigarettes operate by heating a mixture of liquid nicotine and flavoring, which is then inhaled and exhaled in the same manner as a cigarette. However, e-cigarettes do not contain any tobacco or other dangerous additives. Scientific research has shown that the leading cause of cancer in smokers comes from the carcinogens in tobacco. As the movement towards personal health grows, smokers are trying to quit their harmful habits. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business model focuses on three specific divisions in the overall cannabis and eCig industries. It manufactures products that may be sold individually or as system components. We engineer and construct structural components of commercial buildings. We provide consultation in business development and financial strategies. 

&#160;

Employees and Consultants 

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, the Company had no employees and 14 consultants, of whom 9 are primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 3 in Scalable Solutions, and 11 in the operations of mCig. The Company has utilized consultants for non-recurring work. The Company intends to bring a number of the consultants on as employees in the near future. Management believes its relationship with our consultants is good. 

&#160;

Available Information 

&#160;

All reports of the Company filed with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC&#8217;s Web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the public may read and copy materials filed by the Company at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may also obtain additional information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330. 

&#160;

MCIG CONSTRUCTION DIVISION 

&#160;

Description 

&#160;

The Company Construction Division constructs commercial buildings and modular buildings according to plans supplied by the customer, or act as a design/build firm taking the customer from concept to full turnkey occupancy, typically utilizing modular technology and structural insulated panels. The Company has experienced project managers who can take single buildings or entire projects from infancy to occupancy for those customers who desire to have a comprehensive building solution without their actual day-to-day involvement. 

&#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

The Company has competitive strength in that it maintains the ability to take projects from concept to occupancy, to provide architectural and engineering designs for the construction of commercial buildings. This one stop full service line of comprehensive building solutions differentiates the Company within the marketplace. 

&#160;

Market 

&#160;

The Company maintains current construction arms in Las Vegas, Nevada. This market continues to see growth, even during this current time of economic downturn. The Company has licensed General Contractors on staff who build commercial structures in Nevada. The Company utilizes architects and engineers who are qualified in all 48 continental states. 

&#160;

Sales 

&#160;

The Company currently has 4 projects under contract, with 3 under construction prior to April 30, 2016. One of the contracts have been suspended until the customer obtains the necessary approvals to proceed. The focus of the construction division is on cultivation and grow facilities within the State of Nevada at this time. We will continue to look to expand our sales to other states in which cultivation and grow has been authorized, in a methodical approach to continue to keep in line with the Company&#8217;s desire of no toxic debt instruments. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company continues to compete for construction work with many different builders. The construction industry in the United States alone is more than $1 trillion annually. Approximately 2% of the market utilizes structural insulated panels in its construction. This industry is projected to grow 60% per year over the next five years. The potential for growth, even with strong competition, with effective marketing indirectly assists the Company in educating the public, and increasing sales opportunities. 

&#160;

MCIG COMMERCIAL DIVISION 

&#160;

We are engaged in the business of marketing and distributing electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and accessories under the mCig brands. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; mCig 2.0 is available for purchase through the mCig website (www.chillcbdoil.com) and through companies who've ordered them in bulk through the Company&#8217;s wholesale, distributor and retail programs; 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; mCig 3.0 is available for purchase through the mCig owned website (www.chillcbdoil.com) and through companies who've ordered them in bulk through the Company&#8217;s wholesale, distributor and retail programs; 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; mCig 4.0 is available for purchase through the mCig owned website (www.chillcbdoil.com) and through companies who've ordered them in bulk through the Company&#8217;s wholesale, distributor and retail programs; 

&#160;

In development: 

&#160;

mCig, Inc.is currently in the process of researching and developing a future line of products including the mCig 3.5 and the LiqCig, respectively. These products are still in the conceptual phase, as we hope to have these out sometime in 2016. 

&#160;

The Market for Electronic Cigarettes 

&#160;

We compete in a highly competitive market that includes other e-cigarette marketing companies, as well as traditional tobacco companies. In this highly fragmented market, we have focused on building brand awareness early through viral adoption and word of mouth. In the future, we expect to employ additional marketing strategies while continuing to develop our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities. 

&#160;

We market our electronic cigarettes and vaporizers as an alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. We offer our products in three flavor combinations. Because electronic cigarettes offer a &#8220;smoking&#8221; experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their traditional cigarette cravings without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases electronic cigarettes may be used where tobacco-burning cigarettes may not. Electronic cigarettes may be used in some instances where for regulatory or safety reasons tobacco burning cigarettes may not be used. However, we cannot provide any assurances that future regulations may not affect where electronic cigarettes may be used. 

&#160;

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, an estimated 45.3 million people, or 19.3% of adults, in the United States smoke cigarettes. According to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, an industry trade group, more than 3.5 million people currently use electronic cigarettes in the United States. In 2011, about 21% of adults who smoke traditional tobacco cigarettes had used electronic cigarettes, up from about 10% in 2010, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual sales of electronic cigarettes in the United States are estimated to increase to $1 billion in 2013 from $500 million in 2012. Annual sales of traditional tobacco cigarettes, according to industry estimates, were $80 billion in 2012. 

&#160;

Advertising 

&#160;

Currently, we advertise our products primarily through our direct marketing campaign, on the Internet. We also attempt to build brand awareness through social media marketing activities, web-site promotions, and pay-per-click advertising campaigns. 

&#160;

We intend to strategically expand our advertising activities in 2016 and also increase our public relations campaigns to gain editorial coverage for our brands. Some of our competitors promote their brands through print media and through celebrity endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. We believe that our and our competitors&#8217; efforts have helped increase our sales, our product acceptance and general industry awareness. 

&#160;

Distribution and Sales 

&#160;

We offer our electronic cigarettes and related products through our online store at www.mcig.org, which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing, and through a Wholesale Distributor Reseller (WDR) program for large bulk orders. Since their introduction to the U.S. market, electronic cigarettes have predominantly been sold online, while tobacco products, most notably cigarettes are currently sold in approximately 400,000 retail locations. 

&#160;

An online store of mCig, Inc. was officially launched on September 17, 2013 and our online store for VitaCig, Inc. was beta-launched on April 1, 2014, and officially launched on April 15, 2014. We believe that future growth of electronic cigarettes is dependent on higher volume, lower margin sales channels, such as the broad based distribution network through which traditional cigarettes are sold. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Based on the December 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit&#8217;s decision in Sottera, Inc. v. Food &#38; Drug Administration , 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the &#8220;Tobacco Control Act&#8221;). 

&#160;

Under this Court decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;drugs&#8221; or &#8220;devices&#8221; or a &#8220;combination product&#8221; under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. 

&#160;

Because we do not market our electronic cigarettes for therapeutic purposes, and our electronic cigarettes do not contain nicotine, we believe that our products should not fall under the regulatory oversight of the FDA. Nevertheless we believe it is important for any existing or potential investors to understand recent trends in government regulation relating to nicotine-based electronic cigarettes. 

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. 

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act also requires establishment, within the FDA&#8217;s new Center for Tobacco Products, of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. 

&#160;

The Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. For example, the law requires the FDA to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the FDA in 1996 (which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2000 as beyond the FDA&#8217;s authority). As written, these regulations would significantly limit the ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the use of color, graphics and sound effects in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the sale and distribution of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for non-tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. 

&#160;

It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes. 

&#160;

While the FDA has not yet mandated electronic cigarettes be regulated as tobacco products, during 2012, the FDA indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes under the Tobacco Control Act through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition of a &#8220;tobacco product&#8221; under the Tobacco Control Act subject to the FDA&#8217;s jurisdiction. The FDA initially announced that it would issue proposed deeming regulations by April 2013 and then extended the deadline to October 31, 2013. As of the date of this prospectus, the FDA had not taken such action. 

&#160;

The application of the Tobacco Control Act to electronic cigarettes could impose, among other things, restrictions on the content of nicotine in electronic cigarettes, the advertising, marketing and sale of electronic cigarettes, the use of certain flavorings and the introduction of new products. We cannot predict the scope of such regulations or the impact they may have on our company specifically or the electronic cigarette industry generally, though if enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

In this regard, total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell our products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact us to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position. 

&#160;

State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. Certain municipalities have enacted local ordinances which preclude the use of electronic cigarettes where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and certain states have proposed legislation that would categorize electronic cigarettes as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning counterparts. If these bills become laws, electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes; which may have the effect of reducing the demand for our products and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160;

The Tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization&#8217;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (&#8220;FCTC&#8221;). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: 

&#160;

&#160; n &#160; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; 

&#160; n &#160; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; 

&#160; n &#160; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; 

&#160; n &#160; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; 

&#160; n &#160; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; 

&#160; n &#160; &#160; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; 

&#160; n &#160; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; 

&#160; n increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; 

&#160; n &#160; elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and 

&#160; n &#160; encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. 

&#160;

If electronic cigarettes are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160;

Electronic cigarettes may become subject to regulation by the FDA. 

&#160;

The FDA did not appeal the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Sottera, Inc. v. Food &#38; Drug Administration (2010) which held that e-cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products are not drugs or devices unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. The Court held further that electronic cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products can be regulated as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Consequently, the FDA may choose to develop regulations governing the manufacture, marketing and sale of e-cigarettes. For example, pursuant to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the FDA has proposed rules that would extend the agency&#8217;s tobacco authority to cover additional tobacco products, including our products. Potential FDA regulations or significant costs to comply with potential FDA regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our company&#8217;s operations and profitability. 

&#160;

As part of its implementation of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act signed by the President in 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed a new rule that would extend the agency&#8217;s tobacco authority to cover additional tobacco products. Products that would be &#8220;deemed&#8221; to be subject to FDA regulation are those that meet the statutory definition of a tobacco product, including currently unregulated marketed products, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, waterpipe (or hookah) tobacco, and dissolvables not already under the FDA&#8217;s authority. The FDA currently regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco. 

Consistent with currently regulated tobacco products, under the proposed rule, makers of newly deemed tobacco products would, among other requirements: 

&#183; &#160; Register with the FDA and report product and ingredient listings; 

&#183; &#160; Only market new tobacco products after FDA review; 

&#183; &#160; Only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the product will benefit public health as a whole; and 

&#183; &#160; Not distribute free samples. 

In addition, under the proposed rule, the following provisions would apply to newly &#8220;deemed&#8221; tobacco products: 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to underage youth; 

&#183; &#160; Requirements to include health warnings; and 

&#183; &#160; Prohibition of vending machine sales, unless in a facility that never admits youth. 

The FDA proposes different compliance dates for various provisions so that all regulated entities, including small businesses, will have adequate time to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule. 

Products that are marketed for therapeutic purposes will continue to be regulated as medical products under the FDA&#8217;s existing drug and device authorities in the Food, Drug &#38;Cosmetic Act. 

While all comments, data, research, and other information submitted to the docket will be considered, the FDA is requesting comments in certain areas, including: 

&#183; &#160; The FDA recognizes that different tobacco products may have the potential for varying effects on public health and is proposing two options for the categories of cigars that would be covered by this rule. The FDA specifically seeks comment on whether all cigars should be subject to deeming, and which other provisions of the proposed rule may be appropriate or not appropriate for different kinds of cigars. 

&#183; &#160; The FDA seeks answers to the many public health questions posed by products, such as e-cigarettes, that do not involve the burning of tobacco and inhalation of its smoke, as the agency develops an appropriate level of regulatory oversight for these products. The FDA seeks comment in this proposed rule as to how such products should be regulated. 

Failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell our products. 

&#160;

Direct Competitors 

&#160;

We believe that our products afford us a competitive advantage which makes our product unique. Companies that are our closest competitors include OpenVAPE and Vaporbrands International, Inc. We view many of these companies as potential acquisition targets. 

&#160;
