 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

The Company is incorporated in the State of Nevada and was originally incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1967. The Company&#8217;s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#34;DRAM.&#34;

&#160;

On July 6, 2016, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock on a 1 for 3 basis. The reverse stock split was effective on July 11, 2016. Except where otherwise indicated, all per share amounts reflect the reverse stock split.

&#160;

The Company's principal executive office is located at 777 Alexander Road, Suite 100, Princeton, New Jersey, 08540, its telephone number is (609) 799-0071, its fax is (609) 799-6734, and its website is located at http://www.dataram.com.

&#160;

Since 1967, Dataram Corporation (&#8220;Dataram&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) has been an independent manufacturer of memory products and provider of performance solutions. The Company provides customized memory solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible memory for leading brands including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo and Oracle as well as a line of memory products for Intel and AMD motherboard based servers. Dataram manufactures its memory in-house to meet three key criteria - quality, compatibility, and selection - and tests its memory for performance and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) compatibility as part of the production process. With memory designed for over 50,000 systems and with products that range from energy-efficient DDR4 modules to legacy SDR offerings, Dataram offers one of the most complete portfolios in the industry. The Company is a CMTL Premier Participant and ISO 9001 (2008 Certified). Its products are fully compliant with JEDEC Specifications.

&#160;

Dataram&#8217;s customers include an international network of distributors, resellers, retailers, OEM customers and end users.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Dataram competes with several other large independent memory manufacturers and the OEMs noted above. The primary raw material used in producing memory boards is dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. The purchase cost of DRAMs is the largest single component of the total cost of a finished memory board. Consequently, average selling prices for computer memory boards are significantly dependent on the pricing and availability of DRAM chips.

&#160;

In addition to memory products, Dataram offers solutions that provide its customers significant and quantifiable cost savings (reduction in total cost of ownership) while helping them manage end-of-life transitions. These include:

&#8226; Design and engineering services &#8226; Contract and flexible manufacturing to accommodate special customer needs &#8226; Simulation labs for testing and validation &#8226; Financial programs and trade-in / trade-up programs to allow customers to optimize memory procurements &#8226; Software tools to assess memory needs and optimize memory deployment and application performance &#160;

Dataram has four business lines which provide complementary solutions to the market. Each has a different customer focus and &#8220;go to market&#8221; approach. They are:

&#160;

&#160;

Industry Background 

&#160;

The market for the Company's memory products is principally the buyers and owners of workstations, servers and the OEMs that manufacture workstations, servers and other products that use embedded computers. These systems have been important to the growth of the Internet.

`

The OEM market is also an important part of the Company's business. We believe that increasingly cost conscious OEMs are looking to independent memory suppliers such as the Company for the low-cost supply of memory modules.

&#160;

A workstation, like a PC, is designed to provide computer resources to individual users. A workstation differs from a PC by providing substantially greater computational performance, input/output capability and graphic display. Workstations are nearly always networked. As a result of this networking capability of both workstations and PCs, we believe the value of the network server has increased.

&#160;

Network servers are computer systems on a network which provide dedicated functions accessible by all workstations and other systems on the same network. Examples of different types of servers in use today are: file servers, communication servers, computation servers, database servers, print servers and storage servers.

&#160;

The Company designs, produces and markets memory products for workstations and computer servers sold by Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Lenovo, and Oracle. Additionally, the Company produces and markets memory for Intel and AMD processor based motherboards for use by OEMs and channel assemblers.

&#160;

The &#34;open system&#34; philosophy espoused by most of the general computer industry has played a part in enlarging the market for third party vendors. Under the &#34;open system&#34; philosophy, manufacturers adhere to industry design standards, enabling users to &#34;mix and match&#34; hardware and software products from a variety of vendors so that a system can be configured for the user's application in the most economical manner with reduced concern for compatibility and support. Memory products for workstations and servers have become commodities with substantial competition from OEMs and a number of independent memory manufacturer suppliers.

&#160; 

Products 

&#160;

The Company's principal business is the development, manufacture and marketing of memory modules which can be installed initially or, added to various enterprise servers and workstations to upgrade or expand the capabilities of such systems. When vendors produce computer systems adhering to open system industry standards, the development effort for the Company and other independent memory manufacturers is straightforward and allows for the use of many standard components.

&#160;

Our RAMDisk software product creates a virtual RAM drive, or block of memory, which a computer treats as if it were a disk drive. By storing files and programs into memory, a user can speed up internet load times, disk-to-disk activities, accelerate databases and reduce compile times. The product features a save and load option that allows RAMDisk to appear as persistent storage, even through reboots. RAMDisk has developed a strong presence in both the consumer and commercial marketplace. RAMDisk software has also been licensed and integrated into specialized commercial products. RAMDisk is also capable of extending the longevity of expensive solid state storage devices by housing writes which tend to wear out these devices. 

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, with the recommendation of the board of directors, the Company chose to terminate its agreement with AMD to manufacture and sell memory modules for the consumer market branded as AMD under the name Radeon to refocus on its core strength of memory products for the business market.

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

The Company sells its memory products to OEMs, distributors, value-added resellers and larger end-users. The Company also sells its memory products through various internet channels. The Company has sales and/or marketing support offices in the USA and Europe.

&#160;

&#160;

Product Warranty and Service 

&#160;

Management believes that the Company's reputation for the reliability of its memory products and the confidence of prospective purchasers in the Company's ability to provide service over the life of the product are important factors in making sales. As a consequence, the Company adopted a Limited Lifetime Warranty program for its memory products. The economic useful life of the computer systems to which the Company's memory modules are attached is almost always substantially less than the physical useful life of the Company's memory products. Thus, our memory products are unlikely to &#34;wear out.&#34; The Company's experience is that less than 1% of all the products it sells are returned under the Lifetime Warranty.

&#160; 

DRAM Prices 

&#160;

The memory product business is heavily dependent upon the price of DRAMs. Producers of DRAM are required to invest substantial capital resources to produce their end product. Their marginal cost is low as a percentage of the total cost of the product. As a result, the world-wide market for DRAMs has swung in the past from period to period from oversupply to shortage. During periods of substantial oversupply, the Company has seen falling prices for DRAMs and wide availability of DRAMs allowing the Company to maintain minimum inventories to meet the needs of customers. During periods of shortages, DRAMs are allocated to customers and the Company must invest heavily in inventory in order to continue to be assured of the supply of DRAMs from vendors. At the present time, the market for DRAMs is soft, but with spot shortages of certain DRAM configurations.

&#160;

Memory Product Complexity 

&#160;

DRAM memory products for workstations and enterprise servers have, for many years, been undergoing a process of simplification with a corresponding decline in profit margins for current generation memory products as competitors' entry into the market becomes easier. Memory products for prior generations of workstations and servers are sold with higher margins as few competitors continue to supply memory for those computers.

&#160;

Engineering 

&#160;

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends upon its ability to identify new memory needs of its customers. To achieve this goal, the Company's engineering group continually monitors computer system vendors new product developments, and the Company evaluates and tests major components as they become available. The Company designs prototype memory modules and subjects them to reliability testing procedures. The Company incurred engineering costs of $191,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 and $768,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. The engineering cost reduction was primarily the result of software development cost associated with a project that was suspended in January 2015.

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

The Company purchases industry standard DRAMs. The Company also purchases finished modules from DRAM manufacturers. In either case, the cost of DRAM chips is the largest single component of the total cost of our memory products. Fluctuations in the availability or prices of DRAMs can have a significant impact on the Company's profit.

&#160;

The Company has created close relationships with a number of primary suppliers while qualifying and developing alternate sources as backups. The qualification program consists of extensive evaluation of process capabilities, on-time delivery performance and the financial stability of each supplier. Alternative sources are used to assure supply in the event of a problem with the primary source or to handle surges in demand.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The Company assembles its memory boards at its manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania.

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

The Company expects that all of the backlog on hand will be filled during the current fiscal year and most in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017. The Company's backlog at April 30, 2016 was $274,000 and at April 30, 2015 was $98,000. Product backlog at any point in time may not translate into net revenue in any subsequent period, as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The intensely competitive computer industry is characterized by rapid technological change and constant pricing pressures. These characteristics are equally applicable to the third party memory market, where pricing is a major consideration in the buying decision. The Company competes with HP, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Dell, as well as with a number of third party memory suppliers, including Kingston Technology.

&#160;

Although many of the Company's competitors possess significantly greater financial, marketing and technological resources, the Company competes favorably based on the buying criteria of price/performance, time-to-market, product quality, reliability, service/support, breadth of product line and compatibility with computer system vendors' technology. The Company's objective is to continue to remain strong in all of these areas with particular focus on price/performance and time-to-market, which management believes are two of the more important criteria in the selection of third party memory product suppliers. Market research and analysis capability by the Company is necessary to ensure timely information on new products and technologies coming from the computer system vendors and from the overall memory market. The Company must continue low cost, high volume production while remaining flexible to satisfy the time-to-market requirement.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160;

The Company believes that its success depends primarily upon the price and performance of its products rather than on ownership of copyrights or patents.

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sale of memory products for systems that use proprietary memory design may from time to time give rise to claims of copyright or patent infringement. In most such instances the Company has products that either do not violate such patents or copyrights or obtained a license.

&#160;

Because of rapid technological development in the computer industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, questions of infringement may continue to arise in the future. If such patents or copyrights are issued in the future, the Company believes, based upon industry practice, that any necessary licenses would be obtainable upon the payment of reasonable royalties.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, the Company had 24 full-time salaried employees and 12 hourly employees. The Company believes it has satisfactory relationships with its employees. None of the Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

Environmental 

&#160;

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the protection of the environment does not have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company did not make any material expenditures for environmental control facilities in the current fiscal year, nor does the Company expect to make material expenditure in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017.

&#160;
