Overview 

&#160; 

We are a medical cannabis research and development company that applies conventional pharmaceutical research protocols and disciplines to the field of medical cannabis with the objective of establishing a leadership position in the research and development of medical cannabis therapies, products and delivery technologies. We are currently engaged in the research and development of cannabis-based medical products (the &#34;Product Prospects&#34;) for the treatment of multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia as well as development of a cannabis soluble tablet delivery system that may have applications for other indications. We also provide consulting services to governmental and private entities to assist them with developing and implementing tailor-made comprehensive medical cannabis programs. 

&#160; 

We engage in our research and development and consulting activities through our wholly owned Israeli subsidiary OWC. To date, we have executed binding agreements with respect to research and development related to the use of cannabis based products for the treatment of myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia, and for the development of a cannabis soluble tablet delivery system. We have also entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding for the development of a cannabis based topical psoriasis treatment. These agreements were entered into with Israeli research institutions and private corporations. We also provide consulting and advisory services and have entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with an American corporation to advise it on establishing a medical cannabis treatment program. These agreements are described in more detail below. 

&#160; 

In 2008 we acquired a patent relating to our electromagnetic percussion device (the &#34;Device&#34;). In March 2013 we entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with GUMI Tel Aviv Ltd. (&#34;GUMI&#34;), a technology company engaged in the manufacture and sale of industrial equipment, to develop, manufacture and market the Device. To date, we have not derived any revenues from GUMI's marketing efforts. We abandoned this line of business in 2015 and in February 2016 terminated our agreement with GUMI. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Delaware on March 7, 2008 under the name Dynamic Applications Corp. We changed our name to OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. on December 9, 2014. We formed our fully owned subsidiary OWC in Israel on July 6, 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 22 Shacham Street. P.O. Box 8324 Petach Tikva, Israel 4918103 and our telephone number is 972 (0) 3-758-2657. 

&#160; 

Our Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

Our current focus is on researching and developing cannabis based formulations for the treatment of multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia. We believe a significant need remains for novel oral and safe drugs for patients who do not respond to existing therapies or for whom these therapies are unsuitable. Our research and development is focused primarily on exploring several formulations containing active compounds from the cannabis plant, including (but not limited to) the cannabinoids CBD and THC, and identifying potential therapeutic applications of the synergistic effects of these active compounds. The synergistic contributions of our formulations have not yet been scientifically researched and demonstrated. We aim to standardize the formulations across the extracts as a whole, not simply by reference to their key active components (CBD and/or THC). Although there are existing reports and studies on CBD and THC, our formulations may contain several additional active compounds from the cannabis plant that have not been as well studied. Our formulations must be fully researched and documented in order to verify their effectiveness at treating indications, the appropriate dosage levels and the appropriate methods of administration. Following successful research and development, we intend to produce pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid-based products and treatments that will be standardized in composition, formulation and dose, administered by means of an appropriate and efficient delivery system, and tested in properly controlled pre-clinical and clinical studies. We spent $160,325 and $271,394 on research and development in the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

We plan to conduct our research, led by internationally renowned investigators, at the facilities of leading Israeli hospitals and scientific institutions. Dr. Yehuda Baruch, OWC's Director of Research and Regulatory Affairs, and Alon Sinai, OWC's Chief Operating Officer, will monitor the studies. Our team of experts also includes Dr. Asaf Toker, our Chief Science Officer, and Dr. Merav Leiba, our Senior Science Advisor. 

&#160; 

To date, OWC has signed three research collaboration and license agreements with Sheba Academic Medical Center located in Tel Hashomer, Israel (&#34;Sheba&#34;). Sheba is a university-affiliated hospital that serves as one of Israel's national medical centers and is one of the most advanced medical centers in the Middle East. Within the framework of the agreements with Sheba, OWC will initiate three studies at the Sheba facilities to explore the effect of three formulations, all based on active ingredients in the cannabis extracts, on multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia. Each formulation will be targeted at one of the three indications. Pursuant to the collaboration agreements, we expect to pay Sheba $330,000 for conducting the multiple myeloma trial between the 3rd quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016. In addition, we expect to commence pre-clinical studies on the treatment of fibromyalgia and psoriasis during the first quarter of 2016. Pursuant to the collaboration agreements, we are obliged to pay Sheba $300,000 throughout 2016 for conducting the psoriasis research, and $100,000 over a two year period for conducting the fibromyalgia research. We currently have the financial resources to fund our current obligations under these agreements, but anticipate that we will require additional funding during the next 12 months for our continuing and planned expanded operations. 

&#160; 

Dr. Leiba led our in vitro studies on the effect of a formulation comprised of Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on multiple myeloma cells studied outside their normal biological context. The results indicated a 100% mortality rate of myeloma cells in 60% of the cultured cells within a 24 to 48 hour period, and highlight the abilities of cannabis oil extract to successfully fight multiple myeloma cancer. We believe that the results of this study indicate a potential to develop a more effective treatment for multiple myeloma than standard therapies. Based on the results of this pre-clinical study, we proceeded with further pre-clinical studies (safety and toxicity, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic) of our formulation and submitted a clinical trial protocol to the Israeli Institutional Review Board. We have received its approval to commence a clinical study. We intend to commence this clinical study in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

In August 6, 2015, OWC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Emilia Cosmetics Ltd., a large Israeli private label manufacturer, for the development, manufacture and marketing of a cannabinoid-based topical cream to treat psoriasis. The Company intends to enter into a binding agreement with Emilia Cosmetics, which will set forth payment terms, in the first quarter of 2016 and to initiate the development of the topical cream by the end of the first quarter of 2016 at the Emilia Cosmetics labs located in Yerucham, Israel. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into a binding agreement with Emilia Cosmetics on terms favorable to us or at all. The Company expects to complete the development process in the second quarter of 2016 and then to initiate a phase I study at the Sheba facilities to explore the efficacy of the topical cream on psoriasis. However, we do not know if our expectations with respect to the development process will be fulfilled in a timely manner, if at all, or if the costs of development will exceed our anticipation. 

&#160; 

In April 2015 OWC engaged G.C. Group Ltd., an Israeli corporation specializing in pharmaceutical R&#38;D to provide formulation development services for OWC's new delivery system in the form of a cannabis soluble tablet. We see a soluble tablet as providing a superior method of delivery, allowing physicians and researchers to better control the dosage amounts. We believe that the most common usage/delivery methods of medical cannabis in practice today (smoking or ingesting edibles or oil extracts) do not provide an adequate means of dosage control. G.C. Group Ltd. successfully completed the first phase of development, a proof of concept (the R=Research phase) of the desired end product (the soluble tablet) to test the fabric, durability, solidification and other features of the cannabis soluble tablet. The agreement was terminated on December 31, 2015. However, the Company plans to continue the development process. The Company expects to start developing other delivery systems, designed for different indications, during the first quarter of 2016. 

Our Product Prospects Pipeline 

The table below sets forth our current pipeline of Product Prospects, including the target indication and status of each. 

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

According to the 2014 edition of the Marijuana Business Factbook, U.S. retail sales of medical cannabis are expected to rise significantly over the next five years from an estimated $2.2 billion in 2014 to $8.2 billion in 2018. We believe that cannabis based formulations have the potential to effectively treat multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia. 

&#160; 

Controlled substance legislation differs between countries and legislation in certain countries may restrict or limit our ability to distribute or sell our products. We believe that the United States will represent a major market for our cannabis-based Product Prospects due to, in large part, to state level legislation allowing comprehensive public medical cannabis programs. A total of 23 states, the District of Columbia and Guam now allow for comprehensive public medical cannabis programs. Recently approved efforts in 16 states allow use of &#34;low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)&#34; products for medical reasons in limited situations. 

&#160; 

In Europe, medical cannabis programs regulatory frameworks exist in several countries, such as the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Finland and the Czech Republic. It can also be expected that there will be policy changes in the member countries of the European Union concerning the medical use of cannabis and cannabis-based products. We believe that there will be rising demand for cannabis derived medical products and that future growth is expected to be driven by favorable changes in legislation and demographic factors. 

&#160; 

Multiple myeloma is a hematological (blood) cancer that develops in the plasma cells found in bone marrow. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies (immunoglobulins) which are critical for maintaining the body's immune system. Through a complex, multi-step process, healthy plasma cells transform into malignant myeloma cells. Myeloma cells result in the production of abnormal antibodies, or M proteins. The M proteins offer no benefit to the body, and as the amount of M protein increases, it crowds out normally functioning immunoglobulins. This ultimately causes multiple myeloma symptoms such as bone damage or kidney problems. Multiple myeloma is considered to be incurable but treatable. Remissions may be induced with steroids, chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide or lenalidomide, and stem cell transplants. Radiation therapy is sometimes used to reduce pain from bone lesions. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States the lifetime risk of getting multiple myeloma is 1 in 143 and it is estimated that 30,330 new cases will be diagnosed in 2016. 

&#160; 

Fibromyalgia is a chronic health problem that causes pain throughout the body and other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive (memory or thought) problems. According to the National Fibromyalgia Association the disorder affects an estimated ten million people in the United States and an estimated 3 to 6% of the world population. There is no known cure and a variety of prescription medications are often used to reduce pain levels and improve sleep. On June 21, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Lyrica (pregabalin) as the first drug to treat fibromyalgia. Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl) was approved in June 2008 and Savella (milnacipran HCl) was approved in January 2009. 

&#160; 

Psoriasis is a skin condition that affects 2% to 3% of the general population according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. The disease is manifested by scaly plaques on the skin and in the severe form has a major effect on the physical and emotional well-being of the patients. Topical agents are typically used for mild disease, phototherapy for moderate disease, and systemic agents for severe disease. For moderate to severe cases, systemic biologic drugs, delivered via IV, have dominated the market. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, common side effects of biologics include respiratory infections, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions while rare side effects include serious nervous system disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, seizures, or inflammation of the nerves of the eyes, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer. According to Global Data, the psoriasis treatment market was worth $3.6 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow to $6.7 billion by 2018. The current common treatments for psoriasis include topical and systemic drugs, steroids, immunosuppressive drugs such as Cyclosporine A by Novartis, MTX and biological drugs such as Enbrel, Amevive and Ustakinumab. 

&#160; 

Our Consulting Services 

&#160; 

We believe that the complexity of the medical cannabis industry has created a demand for consulting and advisory services in different aspects of the industry. Our employees have substantial experience designing training programs for physicians, caregivers, and researchers that are essential to the establishment of a successful, patient-focused medical cannabis program. Our services are designed to help government officials, policy-makers and regulatory agencies develop and implement tailor-made comprehensive medical cannabis programs. In addition, we also offer medical cannabis regulatory compliance services and patient-care consultancy services to private corporations. Our initial activities to secure consulting contracts will be in member states of the European Union and states of the United States that allow for public medical cannabis programs. 

&#160; 

To date, we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with MedMar LLC (&#34;MedMar&#34;), a U.S. based corporation with operations in Hawaii and Pennsylvania. We are working with MedMar to help it establish a medical cannabis treatment program and define its product and service offerings, train its staff and management and advise on compliance with applicable regulations. To date, MedMar has paid us $50,000 pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding. We intend to enter into a binding consulting and commercialization agreement with MedMar in the second quarter of 2016. We anticipate that we will be able to license some of our formulations and methodologies to MedMar under the terms of the binding agreement. We expect that we will receive monthly fees of $20,000 and royalties of 20% of MedMar's net sales of any products developed under this license for a period of two years. However, we have not yet entered into a binding agreement and there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into a binding agreement on terms favorable to us or at all. Further, there can be no guarantee that MedMar will be successful in establishing a medical cannabis treatment program or that we will be successful in developing any formulations. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

We do not currently have any marketing or sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the pharmaceutical business, which are equipped to market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing capabilities and distribution networks. We intend to out-license some or all of our patent rights to more than one party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop. 

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the fact that we have only commenced our cannabis-based medical research, we believe that we offer the following key characteristics in our approach to developing our cannabis-based Product Prospects: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Our leading medical professionals are recognized leaders in medical cannabis treatments &#160; &#9679; We received approval from the Israeli Institutional Review Board for an in vitro clinical study for the treatment of multiple myeloma &#160; &#9679; We have already filed eight provisional patent applications with the USPTO; &#160; &#9679; We have entered into three research and license agreements with Sheba to conduct research on multiple myeloma, psoriasis and fibromyalgia &#160; &#9679; Understanding governmental regulation is a prerequisite for success in our industry and our team has substantial knowledge and experience with respect to the rules of drug development and medical cannabis programs &#160; &#9679; OWC's expert team delivers years of experience in diverse but relevant disciplines, including medical research and regulatory affairs, as well as extensive cannabis-related issues experience &#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our Product Prospects, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to defend challenges and oppositions from others and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights, including our provisional patents described below. We have not acquired any intellectual property from Dr. Baruch or Mr. Sinai. Rather, they have brought to the Company their wealth of know-how in matters related to medical cannabis, based upon their many years of experience in the medical field as well as Dr. Baruch's service leading the Medical Cannabis Unit of the Israeli Ministry of Health. 

&#160; 

We plan to continue to seek patent protection in the United States and other countries for our proprietary technologies. To date, our intellectual property portfolio includes eight provisional patents, filed with the USPTO, all related to our line of activity (pharmaceutical formulations; drug delivery; therapeutic uses of cannabinoids and other cannabis compounds), as well as know-how and trade secrets. 

&#160; 

The table below depicts the Company's provisional patent applications: 

&#160; 

Application number &#160; Description of Provisional Patent &#160; Filing Date 62/084,568 &#160; Use of Cannabis to Treat Myeloma &#160; 11/26/2014 62/085,663 &#160; Use of Cannabis to Treat PTSD &#160; 12/01/2014 62/088,599 &#160; Use of Cannabis to Treat Migraine &#160; 12/07/2014 62/092,849 &#160; Novel Condom Comprising Cannabis Derived Compositions to Decrease of Erectile Dysfunction Symptoms &#160; 12/17/2014 62/095,020 &#160; Use of Cannabis to Treat Psoriasis &#160; 12/21/2014 62/135,185 &#160; Preparations of Cannabis Emulations and Methods Thereof &#160; 03/19/2015 62/160,609 &#160; Use of Cannabis to Treat Fibromyalgia, Methods of and Compositions Thereof &#160; 05/13/2015 62/173,992 &#160; Synergistic Use of Cannabis for Testing Multiple Myeloma &#160; 06/11/2015 &#160; 

We anticipate that we will file additional patent applications in conjunction with our research, testing, and development of our cannabis-based Product Prospects. 

&#160; 

Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face competition from larger companies that are or may be in the process of offering similar products to ours. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we may be expected to have. 

&#160; 

Competitors may include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and public and private research institutions. Management cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not seriously harm our business prospects. These competitors may be able to react to market changes, respond more rapidly to new regulations or allocate greater resources to the development and promotion of their products than we can. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, some of these competitors may make acquisitions or establish collaborative relationships among themselves to increase their ability to rapidly gain market share. Large pharmaceutical companies may eventually enter the market. 

&#160; 

Given the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies in general and cannabis-related medical research and development in particular, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Time-to-Market is an important factor and our success will depend on our ability to develop innovative products that will be accepted by patients. 

&#160; 

Our success will also depend on our ability to respond quickly to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and our operational performance. 

&#160; 

There can be given no assurance that any of our on cannabis-based medical products will obtain regulatory approval in the US or in other markets that we intent to market such products. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We presently have no full-time employees. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employed under services agreements with the Company. Our officers and directors are expected to dedicate approximately 60% of their professional time to our business until such time that we receive regulatory approval of any Product Prospect. OWC currently has four employees. OWC's employees conduct our medical research through collaboration agreements with third parties. 

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160; 

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

&#160; 

Government Laws and Regulations Relating to the Cannabis Industry 

&#160; 

Israel 

&#160; 

To date, our research and development activities have been conducted in and limited to Israel. The cannabis-based products we are developing contain controlled substance (cannabis) as defined in the Israeli Dangerous Drugs Ordinance [New Version], 5733 - 1973. In Israel, licenses to cultivate, possess and to use cannabis for medical research are granted by the Ministry of Health, IMCU - Israel Medical Cannabis Unit, on an ad-hoc basis. OWC obtained necessary IMCU licenses in order to carry out the research in collaboration with Sheba Academic Medical Center and with G.C. Group. OWC is acquiring the cannabis needed for its research activities from G.K. Medical Cannabis, a government-licensed Israeli medical cannabis grower. Because we do not have a license to possess cannabis, the cannabis that is required for the studies must be transported from the licensed grower directly to Sheba's laboratories, in compliance with our license to use cannabis for medical research. We have applied for additional licenses in order to continue our activities in collaboration with Sheba Academic Medical Center and with G.C. Group. 

&#160; 

Although we have been successful in obtaining a license to use cannabis for medical research, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain this license in the future. 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In the event that we seek to conduct any product-related activities in the United States in the future, the research and development, manufacturing, distribution and sale of our Product Prospects will become subject to the United States' Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulations promulgated thereunder. While cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the &#34;accepted medical use&#34; requirement. If approved by the FDA, we expect the products to be listed by the Drug Enforcement Agency or DEA as a Schedule II or III controlled substance. Consequently, the manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use of our future products will be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. In addition, individual states in the United States have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our products. To date, a total of 23 states, the District of Columbia and Guam allow for comprehensive public medical cannabis programs. In addition, 16 states allow use of &#34;low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)&#34; products for medical reasons in limited situations. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this filing, the Company has provided consulting services to a medical marijuana program with locations in Hawaii and Pennsylvania. We do not grow or distribute cannabis. However, our providing of ancillary products and services to state-approved programs could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see &#34;The Cole Memo&#34;), however, we cannot provide assurance that the Company is in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other federal laws or regulations. Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. 

&#160; 

The Cole Memo 

&#160; 

We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. As discussed above, the CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-related activity. 

&#160; 

In light of these developments, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (the &#34;Cole Memo&#34;) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of DOJ's federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states. 

&#160; 

The Cole Memo reiterates Congress's determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Preventing the distribution of cannabis to minors; &#160; &#9679; Preventing revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; &#160; &#9679; Preventing the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; &#160; &#9679; Preventing state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; &#160; &#9679; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; &#160; &#9679; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; &#160; &#9679; Preventing the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and &#160; &#9679; Preventing cannabis possession or use on federal property. &#160; 

Deputy Attorney General Cole is issuing supplemental guidance directing that prosecutors also consider the Enforcement Priorities with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter, and BSA offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. 

&#160; 

FinCEN 

&#160; 

Since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we or our consulting clients may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts in the United States. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#34;FinCEN&#34;) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations (&#34;BSA&#34;). In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment. 

&#160; 

In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available. 

&#160; 

Europe 

&#160; 

Even though we do not currently intend to distribute any future products or provide consulting services in Europe, we may do so in the future. Approximately 250 substances, including cannabis, are listed in the Schedules annexed to the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (New York, 1961, amended 1972), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 1971) and the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (introducing control on precursors) (Vienna, 1988). The purpose of these listings is to control and limit the use of these drugs according to a classification of their therapeutic value, risk of abuse and health dangers, and to minimize the diversion of precursor chemicals to illegal drug manufacturers. The 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended in 1972 classifies cannabis as Schedule I (&#34;substances with addictive properties, presenting a serious risk of abuse&#34;) and as Schedule IV (&#34;the most dangerous substances, already listed in Schedule I, which are particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value&#34;) narcotic drug. The 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances classifies tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the principal psychoactive cannabinoid of cannabis - as schedule I psychotropic substance (Substances presenting a high risk of abuse, posing a particularly, serious threat to public health which are of very little or no therapeutic value). 

&#160; 

Most countries in Europe are parties to these conventions, which govern international trade and domestic control of these substances, including cannabis. They may interpret and implement their obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining manufacturing and/or marketing approval for our products in those countries or to providing consulting services in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be manufactured and/or marketed, or for us to provide consulting services, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. While some countries in Europe such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Romania, and Finland have decriminalized cannabis or permit its use for medical purposes, no country has completely legalized it. 

&#160; 

Regulations Related to the Drug Regulatory Process 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly controlled regulatory environment. Stringent regulations establish requirements relating to analytical, toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of pharmaceuticals. Regulations also cover research, development, manufacturing and reporting procedures, both pre- and post-approval. Failure to comply with regulations can result in stringent sanctions, including product recalls, withdrawal of approvals, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. Further, may countries have stringent regulations relating to the possession and use of cannabis. 

&#160; 

Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our future product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective. Historically, the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials often have not accurately predicted results of later clinical trials. In addition, a number of pharmaceutical products have shown promising results in clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy results to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. We expect to incur substantial expense for, and devote a significant amount of time to, preclinical studies and clinical trials. Many factors can delay the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials, including the inability to recruit patients at the expected rate, the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment, the failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials, and the emergence of unforeseen safety issues and governmental and regulatory delays. If a product candidate fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, this failure may delay development of other product candidates and hinder our ability to conduct related preclinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, as a result of these failures, we may also be unable to obtain additional financing. 

&#160; 

Governmental authorities in all major markets require that a new pharmaceutical product be approved or exempted from approval before it is marketed, and have established high standards for technical appraisal, which can result in an expensive and lengthy approval process. The time to obtain approval varies by country and some products are never approved. The lengthy process of conducting clinical trials, seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, if approval is obtained, are very costly and require the expenditure of substantial resources. 

&#160; 

A summary of the Israeli, U.S. and EU regulatory processes follow below. 

&#160; 

Israel 

&#160; 

In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations also require authorization from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and similar trials, an additional authorization of the overseeing institutional ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since, at this time, we intend to perform all of the clinical studies in Israel, we will be required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health. 

&#160; 

Israel's Ministry of Health, which regulates medical testing, has adopted protocols that correspond, generally, to those of the FDA and the EMA, making it comparatively straightforward for studies conducted in Israel to satisfy FDA and the European Medicines Agency requirements, thereby enabling medical technologies subjected to clinical trials in Israel to reach U.S. and EU commercial markets in an expedited fashion. Many members of Israel's medical community have earned international prestige in their chosen fields of expertise and routinely collaborate, teach and lecture at leading medical centers throughout the world. Israel also has free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union. 

&#160; 

Currently we do not conduct any product-related activities such as research, development, manufacturing or marketing activities outside of Israel, nor do we expect to for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

In the United States, the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the safety and effectiveness standards for our products and the raw materials and components used in the production of, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of product candidates on a product-by-product basis. 

&#160; 

Preclinical tests include in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing, testing, a sponsor files an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to begin human testing. Typically, a manufacturer conducts a three-phase human clinical testing program which itself is subject to numerous laws and regulatory requirements, including adequate monitoring, reporting, record keeping and informed consent. In Phase I, small clinical trials are conducted to determine the safety and proper dose ranges of product candidates. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted to assess safety and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of product candidates. In Phase III, clinical trials are conducted to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. The time and expense that will be required for us to perform this clinical testing can vary and is substantial. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the Institutional Review Board responsible for approving and monitoring the clinical trials at a given site, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, where one is used, or we may suspend the clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

If the clinical data from these clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) are deemed to support the safety and effectiveness of the candidate product for its intended use, then we may proceed to seek to file with the FDA, a New Drug Application, or NDA, seeking approval to market a new drug for one or more specified intended uses. We have not completed our clinical trials for any candidate product for any intended use and therefore, we cannot ascertain whether the clinical data will support and justify filing an NDA. Nevertheless, if and when we are able to ascertain that the clinical data supports and justifies filing an NDA, we intend to make such appropriate filings. 

&#160; 

The purpose of the NDA is to provide the FDA with sufficient information so that it can assess whether it ought to approve the candidate product for marketing for specific intended uses. The fact that the FDA has designated a drug as an orphan drug for a particular intended use does not mean that the drug has been approved for marketing. Only after an NDA has been approved by the FDA is marketing appropriate. A request for orphan drug status must be filed before the NDA is filed. The orphan drug designation, though, provides certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity subject to certain exceptions. 

&#160; 

The NDA normally contains, among other things, sections describing the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology, human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, microbiology, the results of the clinical trials, and the proposed labeling which contains, among other things, the intended uses of the candidate product. 

&#160; 

We cannot take any action to market any new drug or biologic product in the United States until our appropriate marketing application has been approved by the FDA. The FDA has substantial discretion over the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted. The process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses and these limitations may adversely affect the commercial viability of the product. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals, would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Even after we obtain FDA approval, we may be required to conduct further clinical trials (i.e., Phase IV trials) and provide additional data on safety and effectiveness. We are also required to gain separate approval for the use of an approved product as a treatment for indications other than those initially approved. In addition, side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product's use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. Any adverse event, either before or after marketing approval, can result in product liability claims against us. 

As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a &#34;stand-alone&#34; or &#34;full&#34; NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC, was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA's conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the NDA. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2). 

&#160; 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA's conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized. 

&#160; 

In addition to regulating and auditing human clinical trials, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of such products prior to providing approval to market a product. We have currently received no approvals to market our products from the FDA or other foreign regulators. 

&#160; 

We may also be subject to various federal, state and international laws pertaining to health care &#34;fraud and abuse,&#34; including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-kickback law, which governs federal healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), makes it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Many states have similar laws that are not restricted to federal healthcare programs. Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursement, including claims for the sale of drugs or services, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. If the government or a whistleblower were to allege that we violated these laws there could be a material adverse effect on us, including our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A finding of liability under these laws can have significant adverse financial implications for us and can result in payment of large penalties and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given their broad reach and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we cannot assure you that some of our activities will not be challenged or deemed to violate some of these laws. 

&#160; 

European Economic Area 

&#160; 

Although we are not currently seeking regulatory approval in the EU, we or our potential future licensees may do so in the future. As such, a summary of the EU regulatory processes follows below. 

&#160; 

A medicinal product may only be placed on the market in the European Economic Area, or EEA, composed of the 27 EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, when a marketing authorization has been issued by the competent authority of a member state pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC (as recently amended by Directive 2004/27/EC), or an authorization has been granted under the centralized procedure in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 or its predecessor, Regulation 2309/93. There are essentially three community procedures created under prevailing European pharmaceutical legislation that, if successfully completed, allow an applicant to place a medicinal product on the market in the EEA. 

&#160; 

Centralized Procedure 

&#160; 

Regulation 726/2004/EC now governs the centralized procedure when a marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission, acting in its capacity as the European Licensing Authority on the advice of the EMA. That authorization is valid throughout the entire community and directly or (as to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) indirectly allows the applicant to place the product on the market in all member states of the EEA. The EMA is the administrative body responsible for coordinating the existing scientific resources available in the member states for evaluation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. Certain medicinal products, as described in the Annex to Regulation 726/2004, must be authorized centrally. These are products that are developed by means of a biotechnological process in accordance with Paragraph 1 to the Annex to the Regulation. Medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes must also be authorized centrally. Starting on May 20, 2008, the mandatory centralized procedure was extended to autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. Finally, all medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 must be authorized under the centralized procedure. An applicant may also opt for assessment through the centralized procedure if it can show that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization centrally is in the interests of patients at the community level. For each application submitted to the EMA for scientific assessment, the EMA is required to ensure that the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is given within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. This 210 days period does not include the time that the applicant to answer any questions raised during the application procedure, the so-called 'clock stop' period. If the opinion is positive, the EMA is required to send the opinion to the European Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft decision granting a marketing authorization. This draft decision may differ from the CHMP opinion, stating reasons for diverging for the CHMP opinion. The draft decision is sent to the applicant and the member states, after which the European Commission takes a final decision. If the initial opinion of the CHMP is negative, the applicant is afforded an opportunity to seek a re-examination of the opinion. The CHMP is required to re-examine its opinion within 60 days following receipt of the request by the applicant. All CHMP refusals and the reasons for refusal are made public on the EMA website. Without a centralized marketing authorization it is prohibited to place a medicinal product that must be authorized centrally on the market in the EU. 

&#160; 

Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures 

&#160; 

With the exception of products that are authorized centrally, the competent authorities of the member states are responsible for granting marketing authorizations for medicinal products placed on their national markets. If the applicant for a marketing authorization intends to market the same medicinal product in more than one member state, the applicant may seek an authorization progressively in the community under the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure. Mutual recognition is used if the medicinal product has already been authorized in a member state. In this case, the holder of this marketing authorization requests the member state where the authorization has been granted to act as reference member state by preparing an updated assessment report that is then used to facilitate mutual recognition of the existing authorization in the other member states in which approval is sought (the so-called concerned member state(s)). The reference member state must prepare an updated assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. This report together with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC (which sets out the conditions of use of the product), and a labeling and package leaflet are sent to the concerned member states for their consideration. The concerned member states are required to approve the assessment report, the SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet within 90 days of receipt of these documents. The total procedural time is 180 days. 

&#160; 

The decentralized procedure is used in cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorization in the EU at the time of application. The applicant requests a member state of its choice to act as reference member state to prepare an assessment report that is then used to facilitate agreement with the concerned member states and the grant of a national marketing authorization in all of these member states. In this procedure, the reference member state must prepare, for consideration by the concerned member states, the draft assessment report, a draft SmPC and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. As in the case of mutual recognition, the concerned member states are required to approve these documents within 90 days of their receipt. 

&#160; 

For both mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, if a concerned member state objects to the grant of a marketing authorization on the grounds of a potential serious risk to public health, it may raise a reasoned objection with the reference member state. The points of disagreement are in the first instance referred to the Co-ordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures, or CMD, to reach an agreement within 60 days of the communication of the points of disagreement. If member states fail to reach an agreement, then the matter is referred to the EMA and CHMP for arbitration. The CHMP is required to deliver a reasoned opinion within 60 days of the date on which the matter is referred. The scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP forms the basis for a binding European Commission decision. 

&#160; 

Irrespective of whether the medicinal product is assessed centrally, de-centrally or through a process of mutual recognition, the medicinal product must be manufactured in accordance with the principles of good manufacturing practice as set out in Directive 2003/94/EC and Volume 4 of the rules governing medicinal products in the European community. Moreover, community law requires the clinical results in support of clinical safety and efficacy based upon clinical trials conducted in the European community to be in compliance with the requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC, which implements good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. Clinical trials conducted outside the European community and used to support applications for marketing within the EU must have been conducted in a way consistent with the principles set out in Directive 2001/20/EC. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU requires, pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC, authorization by the relevant national competent authority where a trial takes place, and an ethics committee to have issued a favorable opinion in relation to the arrangements for the trial. It also requires that the sponsor of the trial, or a person authorized to act on his behalf in relation to the trial, be established in the community. 

&#160; 

National Procedure 

&#160; 

This procedure is available for medicinal products that do not fall within the scope of mandatory centralized authorization and are intended for use in only one EU member state. Specific procedures and timelines differ between member states, but the duration of the procedure is generally 210 days and based on a risk/efficacy assessment by the competent authority of the member state concerned, followed by determination of SmPC, package leaflet and label text/layout and subsequently grant of the marketing authorization. Marketing authorizations granted on this basis are not mutually recognized by other member states. 

&#160; 

There are various types of applications for marketing authorizations: 

&#160; 

Full Applications . A full application is one that is made under any of the community procedures described above and &#34;stands alone&#34; in the sense that it contains all of the particulars and information required by Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83 (as amended) to allow the competent authority to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of the product and in particular the balance between benefit and risk. Article 8(3)(l) in particular refers to the need to present the results of the applicant's research on (i) pharmaceutical (physical-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, (ii) preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) studies and (iii) clinical trials in humans. The nature of these tests, studies and trials is explained in more detail in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. Full applications would be required for products containing new active substances not previously approved by the competent authority, but may also be made for other products. 

&#160; 

Abridged Applications . Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC contains exemptions from the requirement that the applicant provide the results of its own preclinical and clinical research. There are three regulatory routes for an applicant to seek an exemption from providing such results, namely (i) cross-referral to an innovator's results without consent of the innovator, (ii) well established use according to published literature and (iii) consent to refer to an existing dossier of research results filed by a previous applicant. 

&#160; 

Cross-referral to Innovator's Data 

&#160; 

Articles 10(1) and 10(2)(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC provide the legal basis for an applicant to seek a marketing authorization on the basis that its product is a generic medicinal product (a copy) of a reference medicinal product that has already been authorized, in accordance with community provisions. A reference product is, in principle, an original product granted an authorization on the basis of a full dossier of particulars and information. This is the main exemption used by generic manufacturers for obtaining a marketing authorization for a copy product. The generic applicant is not required to provide the results of preclinical studies and of clinical trials if its product meets the definition of a generic medicinal product and the applicable regulatory results protection period for the results submitted by the innovator has expired. A generic medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance as the reference medicinal product; &#160; &#9679; having the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product; and &#160; &#9679; whose bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. &#160; 

Applications in respect of a generic medicinal product cannot be made before the expiry of the protection period. Where the reference product was granted a national marketing authorization pursuant to an application made before October 30, 2005, the protection period is either 6 years or 10 years, depending upon the election of the particular member state concerned. Where the reference product was granted a marketing authorization centrally, pursuant to an application made before November 20, 2005, the protection period is 10 years. For applications made after these dates, Regulation 726/2004 and amendments to Directive 2001/83/EC provide for a harmonized protection period regardless of the approval route utilized. The harmonized protection period is in total 10 years, including eight years of research data protection and two years of marketing protection. The effect is that the originator's results can be the subject of a cross-referral application after eight years, but any resulting authorization cannot be exploited for a further two years. The rationale of this procedure is not that the competent authority does not have before it relevant tests and trials upon which to assess the efficacy and safety of the generic product, but that the relevant particulars can, if the research data protection period has expired, be found on the originator's file and used for assessment of the generic medicinal product. The 10-year protection period can be extended to 11 years where, in the first eight years post-authorization, the holder of the authorization obtains approval for a new indication assessed as offering a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing products. 

&#160; 

If the copy product does not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product or if certain types of changes occur in the active substance(s) or in the therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration in relation to the reference medicinal product, Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC provides that the results of the appropriate preclinical studies or clinical trials must be provided by the applicant. 

&#160; 

Well-Established Medicinal Use 

&#160; 

Under Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, an applicant may, in substitution for the results of its own preclinical and clinical research, present detailed references to published literature demonstrating that the active substance(s) of a product have a well-established medicinal use within the community with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. The applicant is entitled to refer to a variety of different types of literature, including reports of clinical trials with the same active substance(s) and epidemiological studies that indicate that the constituent or constituents of the product have an acceptable safety/efficacy profile for a particular indication. However, use of the published literature exemption is restricted by stating that in no circumstances will constituents be treated as having a well-established use if they have been used for less than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use of the substance as a medicinal product in the EU. Even after 10 years' systematic use, the threshold for well-established medicinal use might not be met. European pharmaceutical law requires the competent authorities to consider among other factors the period over which a substance has been used, the amount of patient use of the substance, the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (as reflected in the scientific literature) and the coherence (consistency) of all the scientific assessments made in the literature. For this reason, different substances may reach the threshold for well-established use after different periods, but the minimum period is 10 years. If the applicant seeks approval of an entirely new therapeutic use compared with that to which the published literature refers, additional preclinical and/or clinical results would have to be provided. 

&#160; 

Informed Consent 

&#160; 

Under Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, following the grant of a marketing authorization the holder of such authorization may consent to a competent authority utilizing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical documentation that it submitted to obtain approval for a medicinal product to assess a subsequent application relating to a medicinal product possessing the same qualitative and quantitative composition with respect to the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form. 

&#160; 

Law Relating to Pediatric Research 

&#160; 

Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 (as amended by Regulation (EC) 1902/2006) was adopted on December 12, 2006. This Regulation governs the development of medicinal products for human use in order to meet the specific therapeutic needs of the pediatric population. It requires any application for marketing authorization made after July 26, 2008 in respect of a product not authorized in the European Community on January 26, 2007 (the time the Regulation entered into force), to include the results of all studies performed and details of all information collected in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan agreed by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, unless the product is subject to an agreed waiver or deferral or unless the product is excluded from the scope of Regulation 1902/2006 (generics, hybrid medicinal products, biosimilars, homeopathic and traditional (herbal) medicinal products and medicinal products containing one or more active substances of well-established medicinal use). Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances where pediatric studies are not required or desirable. Deferrals can be granted in certain circumstances where the initiation or completion of pediatric studies should be deferred until appropriate studies in adults have been performed. Moreover, this regulation imposes the same obligation from January 26, 2009 on an applicant seeking approval of a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a product already authorized and still protected by a supplementary protection certificate granted under Regulation EC 469/2009 and its precursor (EEC) 1768/92 or by a patent that qualifies for the granting of such a supplementary protection certificate. The pediatric Regulation 1901/2006 also provides, subject to certain conditions, a reward for performing such pediatric studies, regardless of whether the pediatric results provided resulted in the grant of a pediatric indication. This reward comes in the form of an extension of six months to the supplementary protection certificate granted in respect of the product, unless the product is subject to orphan drug designation, in which case the 10-year market exclusivity period for such orphan products is extended to 12 years. If any of the non-centralized procedures for marketing authorization have been used, the six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate is only granted if the medicinal product is authorized in all member states.

Post-authorization Obligations 

&#160; 

In the pre-authorization phase the applicant must provide a detailed pharmacovigilance plan that it intends to implement post-authorization. An authorization to market a medicinal product in the EU carries with it an obligation to comply with many post-authorization organizational and behavioral regulations relating to the marketing and other activities of authorization holders. These include requirements relating to post-authorization efficacy studies, post-authorization safety studies, adverse event reporting and other pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising, packaging and labeling, patient package leaflets, distribution and wholesale dealing. The regulations frequently operate within a criminal law framework and failure to comply with the requirements may not only affect the authorization, but also can lead to financial and other sanctions levied on the company in question and responsible officers. As a result of the currently on-going overhaul of EU pharmacovigilance legislation the financial and organizational burden on market authorization holders will increase significantly, such as the obligation to maintain a pharmacovigilance system master file that applies to all holders of marketing authorizations granted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Marketing authorization holders must furthermore collect data on adverse events associated with use of the authorized product outside the scope of the authorization. Pharmacovigilance for biological products and medicines with a new active substance will be strengthened by subjecting their authorization to additional monitoring activities. The EU is currently in the process of issuing implementing regulations for the new pharmacovigilance framework. 

&#160; 

Any authorization granted by member state authorities, which within three years of its granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorized product in the authorizing member state ceases to be valid. When an authorized product previously placed on the market in the authorizing member state is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three consecutive years, the authorization for that product shall cease to be valid. The same two three year periods apply to authorizations granted by the European Commission based on the centralized procedure.
