Background 

We were founded as Paravax, Inc. in 1988 and conducted research on vaccines to prevent infections by parasites. We changed our name to Heska Corporation in 1995, completed our initial public offering in 1997 and continued to be a research and development-focused company, devoting substantial resources to the research and development of innovative products for the companion animal health market. We subsequently took steps to lower our expense base, largely in internal research and development, and continued to concentrate our efforts on operating improvements, such as enhancing the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and pursuing cost efficiencies, as well as seeking new product opportunities with third parties. We acquired a 54.6% interest in Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC in February 2013 (the "Acquisition"), which marked our entry into the veterinary imaging market. In June 2013, we sold certain non-core assets useful for the production of both bovine and feline vaccines to Elanco Animal Health ("Elanco"), a division of Eli Lilly and Company. 

Products and Services 

Our business is composed of two reportable segments, Core Companion Animal Health and Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals and Products. The Core Companion Animal Health segment ("CCA") includes, primarily for canine and feline use, blood testing instruments and supplies, digital imaging products, software and services, and single use products and services such as heartworm diagnostic tests, heartworm preventive products, allergy immunotherapy products and allergy testing. These products are sold directly to veterinarians by us as well as through distribution relationships. The Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals and Products segment ("OVP") includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production, primarily for cattle but also for other animals including small mammals. All OVP products are sold by third parties under third party labels. 

Core Companion Animal Health Segment 

We presently sell a variety of companion animal health products and services, among the most significant of which are the following: 

Veterinary Blood Testing and Other Non-Imaging Instruments 

We offer a line of veterinary blood testing and other instruments, some of which are described below. We also market and sell consumable supplies for these instruments. Our line of veterinary instruments includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Blood Chemistry. The Element DC &#8482; &#32;Veterinary Chemistry Analyzer (the "Element DC") is an easy-to-use, robust system that uses dry slide technology for blood chemistry and electrolyte analysis and has the ability to run 22 tests at a time with a single blood sample. Test slides are available as both pre-packaged panels as well as individual slides. The DRI-CHEM 7000 Veterinary Chemistry Analyzer (the "DRI-CHEM 7000") is a complementary chemistry offering, co-branded with FUJIFILM Corporation ("FUJIFILM"), with higher throughput, multiple patient staging and a "STAT" feature which provides emergency sample flexibility in critical cases. The Element DC and DRI-CHEM 7000 utilize the same test slides. We are supplied with the Element DC, the DRI-CHEM 7000 and affiliated test slides and supplies under a contractual agreement with FUJIFILM. 

&#8226; 

Hematology. The Element HT &#8482; 5 Hematology Analyzer (the "HT5") is a true 5-part hematology analyzer which uses laser, impedance and colorimetric technologies to measure key parameters such as white blood cell count, red blood cell count, platelet count and hemoglobin levels in 

- 2 - 

animals. The HT5 can generate results in less than a minute with 15 &#181;L of sample. We began to ship HT5 units in January 2015. We are supplied with the HT5 and affiliated reagents and supplies under a contractual agreement with Shenzen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Mindray"). The HEMATRUE Veterinary Hematology Analyzer (the "HEMATRUE") is an easy-to-use and reliable 3-part hematology blood analyzer that we continue to offer to our customers. We are supplied HEMATRUE instruments and affiliated reagents and supplies for the HEMATRUE under a contractual agreement with Boule Medical AB ("Boule"). 

&#8226; 

Blood Gases and Electrolytes. &#32;&#32;The Element POC&#8482; Blood Gas &#38; Electrolyte Analyzer ("EPOC") is a handheld, wireless analyzer which delivers rapid blood gas, electrolyte, metabolite, and basic blood chemistry testing. EPOC features test cards with room temperature storage which can offer results with less than 100 &#181;L of sample as well as WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. We began to ship EPOC units to customers in October 2013. EPOC and affiliated consumables and supplies are supplied to us under a contractual agreement with Alere North America, LLC, a unit of Alere Inc. 

&#8226; 

Immunodiagnostics . The Element i Immunodiagnostic Analyzer ("Element i") utilizes &#160; fluorescence immunoassay technology to ensure sensitivity for accurate in-clinic detection of Total T4, TSH and Cortisol. The Element i is a benchtop technology with a test time of 10 minutes or less per analyte. Along with confidence in results, this measurement principle allows for simplified reagents and testing protocols. Element i units, which we began shipping in December 2015, are supplied to us under a contractual agreement with FUJIFILM. 

&#8226; 

IV Pumps. The VET/IV 2.2 infusion pump is a compact, affordable IV pump that allows veterinarians to easily provide regulated infusion of fluids for their patients. 

Veterinary Imaging Instruments and Services 

On February 24, 2013, we acquired a 54.6% interest in Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC, which was subsequently renamed Heska Imaging US, LLC ("Heska Imaging") and operates only in the United States. This transaction marked our entry into the veterinary imaging market. Heska Imaging's offerings in this area include: 

Digital Radiography Solutions. &#32;&#32;Our digital radiography solutions are marketed and sold under the "Cuattro" brand name. We sell hardware including digital radiography detectors, acquisition workstation equipment, positioning aides such as tunnels and tables, viewing computers and other accessories along with embedded software and support, data hosting and other services. CloudDR TM &#32;solutions combine flat panel digital radiography acquisition with web-based image storage. Cloudbank TM &#32;is an automatic, secure, web-based image storage solution designed to interface with the software we sell. ViewCloud TM &#32;is a PACS (Picture Archival and Communications System) for Cloudbank for web or local viewing, reporting, planning and email sharing of studies on internet devices, including personal computers, tablet devices and smartphones.

Ultrasound Systems. &#32;&#32;Our ultrasound products, including affiliated probes and peripherals, are provided to us under an exclusive agreement with Esaote USA ("Esaote"). We sell several different ultrasound products with varying features and corresponding price points, all under Esaote's trade names or logos. These offerings include the MyLab family of high performance systems and probes, for use in abdominal, cardiac and small parts applications in companion animal and equine patients as well as other species. The ultrasound products we sell generally seamlessly integrate with our Cloudbank and ViewCloud offerings for image storing and viewing. 

Point-of-Care Heartworm Diagnostic Tests 

Heartworm infections of dogs and cats are caused by the parasite Dirofilaria immitis . This parasitic worm is transmitted in larval form to dogs and cats through the bite of an infected mosquito. Larvae develop into adult worms that live in the pulmonary arteries and heart of the host, where they can cause serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease. Our canine and feline heartworm diagnostic tests use monoclonal antibodies or a recombinant heartworm antigen, respectively, to detect heartworm antigens or antibodies circulating in the blood of an infected animal. 

We currently market and sell heartworm diagnostic tests for both dogs and cats. SOLO STEP CH for dogs and SOLO STEP FH for cats are available in point-of-care, single use formats that can be used by veterinarians on site. We also offer SOLO STEP CH Batch Test Strips, a rapid and simple point-of-care antigen detection test for dogs that allows veterinarians in larger practices to run multiple samples at the same time. We obtain SOLO STEP CH, SOLO STEP FH and SOLO STEP Batch Test Strips under a contractual agreement with Quidel Corporation ("Quidel"). 

Heartworm Preventive Products 

We have an agreement with Merck Animal Health, a unit of Merck &#38; Co., Inc., granting Merck Animal Health the exclusive distribution and marketing rights for our canine heartworm prevention product, TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets, ultimately sold to or through veterinarians in the United States and Canada. TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets (ivermectin/pyrantel) are indicated for use as a monthly preventive treatment of canine heartworm infection and for treatment and control of ascarid and hookworm infections. We manufacture TRI-HEART Plus Chewable Tablets at our Des Moines, Iowa production facility. 

Allergy Products and Services 

Allergy is common in companion animals, and it has been estimated to affect approximately 10% to 15% of dogs. Clinical symptoms of allergy are variable, but are often manifested as persistent and serious skin disease in dogs and cats. Clinical management of allergic disease is problematic, as there are a large number of allergens that may give rise to these conditions. Although skin testing is often regarded as the most accurate diagnostic procedure, such tests can be painful, subjective and inconvenient. The effectiveness of the immunotherapy that is prescribed to treat allergic disease is inherently limited by inaccuracies in the diagnostic process. 

We believe that our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels provide the most accurate determination of which we are aware of the specific allergens to which an animal, such as a dog, cat or horse, is reacting. The panels use a highly specific recombinant version of the natural IgE receptor to test the serum of potentially allergic animals for IgE directed against a panel of known allergens. A typical test panel consists primarily of various pollen, grass, mold, insect and mite allergens. The test results serve as the basis for 

- 4 - 

prescription ALLERCEPT Therapy Shots and ALLERCEPT Therapy Drops. We operate veterinary laboratories in Loveland, Colorado and Fribourg, Switzerland which both offer blood testing using our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels. 

We sell kits to conduct blood testing using our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels to third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories outside of the United States. We also sell products to screen for the presence of allergen-specific IgE to these customers - we sell kits to conduct preliminary blood testing using products based on our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels as well as a similar test requiring less technical sophistication, our E-SCREEN Test. Animals testing positive for allergen-specific IgE using these screening tests are candidates for further evaluation using our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels. 

Veterinarians who use our ALLERCEPT Definitive Allergen Panels often purchase our ALLERCEPT Therapy Shots or ALLERCEPT Therapy Drops for those animals with positive test results. These prescription immunotherapy treatment sets are formulated specifically for each allergic animal and contain only the allergens to which the animal has significant levels of IgE antibodies. The prescription formulations are administered in a series of subcutaneous injections (Shots) or by daily sublingual (under the tongue) administration (Drops), with doses increasing over several months, to ameliorate the allergic condition of the animal. Immunotherapy is generally continued for an extended time. We offer canine, feline and equine subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy treatment products. We believe our ALLERCEPT Therapy Drops offer a convenient alternative to subcutaneous injection, thereby increasing the likelihood of pet owner compliance. 

Other Core Companion Animal Health Single Use Products. We also sell other products in our Core Companion Animal Health segment. 

Other Vaccines, Pharmaceuticals and Products Segment 

We developed a line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"). Historically, the largest distributor of these vaccines was Agri Laboratories, Ltd. ("AgriLabs"), who sold these vaccines primarily under the Titanium&#174; and MasterGuard&#174; brands. In November 2013, AgriLabs assigned the long-term agreement with us related to these vaccines to, and the agreement was assumed by, Eli Lilly and Company ("Eli Lilly") acting through Elanco. In January 2015, we signed a long-term Master Supply Agreement related to these vaccines with Eli Lilly acting through Elanco, thereby terminating the AgriLabs agreement previously assumed by Eli Lilly in November 2013. 

We manufacture biological and pharmaceutical products for a number of other animal health companies. We manufacture products for animals other than cattle including horses and small mammals. Our offerings range from providing complete turnkey services which include research, licensing, production, labeling and packaging of products to providing any one of these services as needed by our customers as well as validation support and distribution services. 

Marketing, Sales and Customer Support 

We estimate that there are approximately 53,000 veterinarians in the United States whose practices are devoted principally to small animal medicine and these veterinarians practice in approximately 24,000 clinics in the United States. Veterinarians may obtain our products directly from us or indirectly through others. All our Core Companion Animal Health products ultimately are sold primarily to or through veterinarians. In many cases, veterinarians will markup their costs to the end user. The acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success. 

- 5 - 

We currently market our Core Companion Animal Health products in the United States to veterinarians through an outside field organization, a telephone sales force, independent third-party distributors, as well as through trade shows and print advertising and through other distribution relationships, such as Merck Animal Health in the case of our heartworm preventive. As of December 31, 2015, our outside field organization consisted of 36 individuals in various parts of the United States and our inside sales force consisted of 26 individuals. 

We have a staff dedicated to customer and product support in our Core Companion Animal Health segment including veterinarians, technical support specialists and service technicians. Individuals from our product development group may also be used as a resource in responding to certain product inquiries. 

Internationally, we market our Core Companion Animal Health products to veterinarians primarily through third-party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third-party distributors. 

All OVP products are marketed and sold by third parties under third-party labels. 

We grant third parties rights to our intellectual property as well as our products, with our compensation often taking the form of royalties and/or milestone payments. 

Manufacturing 

The majority of our revenue is from proprietary products manufactured by third parties. Third parties manufacture our veterinary instruments, including affiliated consumables and supplies, as well as other products including key components of our heartworm point-of-care diagnostic tests. Our chemistry and immunodiagnostic instruments and affiliated supplies are manufactured under contracts with FUJIFILM. Our hematology instruments and affiliated supplies are manufactured under contracts with Mindray and Boule. Our blood gas and electrolyte analyzers and affiliated supplies are supplied under a contract with Alere North America, LLC. Our digital radiography products are supplied under a contract with Cuattro, LLC, which typically buys its hardware products and components from third parties. Our ultrasound products are supplied under a contract with Esaote USA. Key components of our heartworm point-of-care diagnostic tests are manufactured under a contract with Quidel. We manufacture and supply Quidel with certain critical raw materials and perform the final packaging operations for these products. 

Our facility in Des Moines, Iowa is a USDA, Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), and Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA") licensed biological and pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. This facility currently has the capacity to manufacture more than 50 million doses of vaccine each year. We expect that we will, for the foreseeable future, manufacture most or all of our pharmaceutical and biological products at this facility, as well as most or all of our recombinant proteins and other proprietary reagents for our diagnostic tests. We currently manufacture our canine heartworm prevention product, our allergy treatment products and all our OVP segment products at this facility. Our OVP segment's customers purchase products in both finished and bulk format, and we perform all phases of manufacturing, including growth of the active bacterial and viral agents, sterile filling, lyophilization and packaging at this facility. We manufacture our various allergy products at our Des Moines facility, our Loveland facility and our Fribourg facility. We believe the raw materials for products we manufacture are available from more than one source.

Product Development 

We are committed to providing innovative products to address health needs of companion animals. We may obtain such products from external sources, external collaboration or internal research and development. 

We are committed to identifying external product opportunities and creating business and technical collaborations that lead to high value veterinary products. We believe that our active participation in scientific networks and our reputation for investing in research enhances our ability to acquire external product opportunities. We have collaborated, and intend to continue to do so, with a number of companies and universities. Examples of such collaborations include: 

&#8226; 

Quidel for the development of SOLO STEP CH Cassettes, SOLO STEP CH Batch Test Strips and SOLO STEP FH Cassettes; 

&#8226; 

Mindray for the development of veterinary applications for the ELEMENT HT5 Veterinary Hematology Analyzer and associated reagents; and 

&#8226; 

FUJIFILM for the development of veterinary applications for the Element DC Veterinary Chemistry Analyzer and associated slides and supplies. 

Internal research and development is managed on a case-by-case basis. We employ individuals with expertise in various applicable areas and will form multidisciplinary product-associated teams as appropriate. We incurred expenses of $ 1.5 million , $ 1.4 million &#32;and $1.7 million &#32;in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, in support of our research and development activities. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights represent opportunities to grow our business and maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. The proprietary technologies of our OVP segment are primarily protected through trade secret protection of, for example, our manufacturing processes in this area. 

We actively seek patent protection both in the United States and abroad. Our issued patent portfolios primarily relate to heartworm control, flea control, allergy, infectious disease vaccines, diagnostic and detection tests, immunomodulators, instrumentation, nutrition, pain control and vaccine delivery technologies. As of December 31, 2015, we owned, co-owned or had rights to 139 issued U.S. patents expiring at various dates from January 2016 to May 2028 and had no pending U.S. patent applications. Our corresponding foreign patent portfolio as of December 31, 2015 included 116 issued patents in various foreign countries expiring at various dates from March 2016 to August 2024 and had no pending applications. 

We also have obtained exclusive and non-exclusive licenses for numerous other patents held by academic institutions and for profit companies. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

In 2013, 2014 and 2015, our fourth quarter results were significantly stronger than those for any other quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the future as it is a historical trend within our digital imaging business. 

Government Regulation 

Although the majority of our revenue is from the sale of unregulated items, many of our products or products that we may develop are, or may be, subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, including the USDA and the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. These regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. Satisfaction of these requirements can take several years to achieve and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approval or clearances, if required, before it may be marketed in a particular country. The following summarizes the major U.S. government agencies that regulate animal health products: 

&#8226; 

USDA . Vaccines and certain single use, point-of-care diagnostics are considered veterinary biologics and are therefore regulated by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CVB, of the USDA. Industry data indicates that it takes approximately four years and in excess of $1.0 million to license a conventional vaccine for animals from basic research through licensing. In contrast to vaccines, single use, point-of-care diagnostics can typically be licensed by the USDA in about two years, at considerably less cost. However, vaccines or diagnostics that use innovative materials, such as those resulting from recombinant DNA technology, usually require additional time to license. The USDA licensing process involves the submission of several data packages. These packages include information on how the product will be manufactured, information on the efficacy and safety of the product in laboratory and target animal studies and information on performance of the product in field conditions. 

&#8226; 

FDA . Pharmaceutical products, which typically include synthetic compounds, are approved and monitored by the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the same statutory standard for FDA approval applies to both human and animal drugs: demonstrated safety, efficacy and compliance with FDA manufacturing standards. However, unlike human drugs, neither preclinical studies nor a sequential phase system of studies are required. Rather, for animal drugs, studies for safety and efficacy may be conducted immediately in the species for which the drug is intended. Thus, there is no required phased evaluation of drug performance, and the Center for Veterinary Medicine will review data at appropriate times in the drug development process. The process can be costly and time consuming, requiring up to $100 million and seven to ten years to sell an animal drug in the market. In addition, the time and cost for developing companion animal drugs may be significantly less than for drugs for livestock animals, which generally have enhanced standards designed to ensure safety in the food chain. 

&#8226; 

EPA . Products that are applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. 

- 8 - 

After we have received regulatory licensing or approval for our products, numerous regulatory requirements typically apply. Among the conditions for certain regulatory approvals is the requirement that our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices or other manufacturing regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as maintenance of records and documentation. The USDA, FDA and foreign regulatory authorities strictly enforce manufacturing regulatory requirements through periodic inspections and/or reports. 

A number of our animal health products are not regulated. For example, certain products such as our ALLERCEPT panels are not regulated by either the USDA or FDA. Similarly, none of our veterinary instruments requires regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the United States. 

We have pursued regulatory approval outside the United States based on market demographics of foreign countries. For marketing outside the United States, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing regulatory licensing and approval for many of our products. Licensing and approval by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before we can market products in those countries. Product licensing approval processes and requirements vary from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required in the United States. We cannot be certain that approval of any of our products in one country will result in approvals in any other country. 

To date, we or our distributors have sought regulatory approval for certain of our products in Canada, which is governed by the Canadian Center for Veterinary Biologics, or CCVB; in Japan, which is governed by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, or MAFF; in Australia, which is governed by the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, or ADAFF; in South Africa, which is governed by the Republic of South Africa Department of Agriculture, or RSADA; and in certain other countries requiring such approval.

Competition 

Our market is intensely competitive. Our competitors include independent animal health companies and major pharmaceutical companies that have animal health divisions. We also compete with independent, third-party distributors, including distributors who sell products under their own private labels. In the point-of-care diagnostic testing market, our major competitors include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX"), Abaxis, Inc. ("Abaxis") and Zoetis Inc. ("Zoetis"). The products manufactured by our OVP segment for sale by third parties compete with similar products offered by a number of other companies, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources than us and may have more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than our OVP segment's customers. Companies with a significant presence in the animal health market such as Bayer AG, CEVA Sant&#233; Animale, Eli Lilly, Merck, Sanofi, V&#233;toquinol S.A., Virbac S.A. and Zoetis may be marketing or developing products that compete with our products or would compete with them if successfully developed. These and other competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, research and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we do. Our competitors may offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we do. 

Environmental Regulation 

In connection with our product development activities and manufacturing of our biological, pharmaceutical and diagnostic and detection products, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we and our subsidiaries employed 310 people, of whom 135 were focused in production and technical and logistical services, including instrumentation service, 115 in sales, marketing and customer support, 55 in general and administrative services, such as finance, and 5 in product development. We believe that our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel is critical to our success. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.
