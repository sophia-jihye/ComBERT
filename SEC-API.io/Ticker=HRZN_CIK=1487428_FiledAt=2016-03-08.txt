 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

We are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in development-stage companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech industries, which we refer to collectively as our &#8220;Target Industries.&#8221; Our investment objective is to generate current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making secured debt investments, which we refer to as &#8220;Venture Loans,&#8221; to venture capital backed companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to as &#8220;Venture Lending.&#8221; We also selectively provide Venture Loans to publicly traded companies in our Target Industries. Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a revolving line of credit, or &#8220;Senior Term Loans.&#8221; Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company&#8217;s debt service obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the relatively rapid amortization of the Venture Loan and (4) the lender&#8217;s receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan.

&#160;

We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on our investment company taxable income and our net capital gain that we distribute to our stockholders as long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements.

&#160;

Compass Horizon Funding Company LLC, or Compass Horizon, our predecessor company, commenced operations in March 2008. We were formed in March 2010 for the purpose of acquiring Compass Horizon and continuing its business as a public entity.

&#160;

From our inception through December 31, 2015, we funded 138 portfolio companies and invested $780.0 million in debt investments. As of December 31, 2015, our debt investment portfolio consisted of 52 debt investments with an aggregate fair value balance of $242.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, 97.8%, or $236.9 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans. As of December 31, 2015, 18.6%, or $45.1 million, of our total debt investment portfolio at fair value was held through our 2013-1 Securitization. As of December 31, 2015, our net assets were $159.8 million and all of our debt investments were secured by all or a portion of the tangible and intangible assets of the applicable portfolio company. The debt investments in our portfolio are generally not rated by any rating agency. If the individual debt investments in our portfolio were rated, they would be rated below &#8220;investment grade&#8221; because they are subject to many risks, including volatility, intense competition, short product life cycles and periodic downturns.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted annualized yield of 14.2% (excluding any yield from warrants). The warrants we receive from time to time when making loans to portfolio companies are excluded from the calculation of our dollar-weighted annualized yield because such warrants do not generate any yield since we do not receive dividends or other payments in respect of our outstanding warrants. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. As of December 31, 2015, our debt investments had a dollar-weighted average term of 44 months from inception and a dollar-weighted average remaining term of 32 months. As of December 31, 2015, substantially all of our debt investments had an original committed principal amount of between $2 million and $12 million, repayment terms of between 11 and 48 months and bore current pay interest at annual interest rates of between 9% and 13%.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our total return based on market value was (6.3)%. Total return based on market value is calculated as (x) the sum of (i) the closing sales price of our common stock on the last day of the period plus (ii) distributions paid per share during the period, less (iii) the closing sales price of our common stock on the first day of the period, divided by (y) the closing sales price of our common stock on the first day of the period.

&#160;

In addition to our debt investments, as of December 31, 2015, we held warrants to purchase stock in 83 portfolio companies, equity positions in six portfolio companies and success fee arrangements in ten portfolio companies.

&#160;

Our investment activities, and our day-to-day operations, are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, or the Board, of which a majority of the members are independent of us. Under an amended and restated investment management agreement, or the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its advisory services to us. We have also entered into an administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with our Advisor under which we have agreed to reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.

&#160;

Our common stock began trading October 29, 2010 and is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;HRZN&#8221;.

Our advisor 

&#160;

Our investment activities are managed by our Advisor, and we expect to continue to benefit from our Advisor&#8217;s ability to identify attractive investment opportunities, conduct diligence on and value prospective investments, negotiate investments and manage our diversified portfolio of investments. In addition to the experience gained from the years that they have worked together both at our Advisor and prior to the formation of our Advisor, the members of our investment team have broad lending backgrounds, with substantial experience at a variety of commercial finance companies, technology banks and private debt funds, and have developed a broad network of contacts within the venture capital and private equity community. This network of contacts provides a principal source of investment opportunities.

&#160;

Our Advisor is led by five senior managers including Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, Gerald A. Michaud, our President, Christopher M. Mathieu, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John C. Bombara, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, and Daniel S. Devorsetz, our Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer.

&#160; 

Our strategy 

&#160;

Our investment objective is to maximize our investment portfolio&#8217;s total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. To further implement our business strategy, we expect our Advisor to continue to employ the following core strategies:

&#160;

&#8226; Structured investments in the venture capital and private equity markets. We make loans to development-stage companies within our Target Industries typically in the form of secured loans. The secured debt structure provides a lower risk strategy, as compared to equity investments, to participate in the emerging technology markets because the debt structures we typically utilize provide collateral against the downside risk of loss, provide return of capital in a much shorter timeframe through current-pay interest and amortization of principal and have a senior position to equity in the borrower&#8217;s capital structure in the case of insolvency, wind down or bankruptcy. Unlike venture capital and private equity investments, our investment returns and return of our capital do not require equity investment exits such as mergers and acquisitions or initial public offerings. Instead, we receive returns on our debt investments primarily through regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest and, if necessary, liquidation of the collateral supporting the debt investment upon a default. Only the potential gains from warrants depend upon equity investments exits. &#160;

&#8226; &#8220;Enterprise value&#8221; lending. We and our Advisor take an enterprise value approach to the loan structuring and underwriting process. Enterprise value includes the implied valuation based upon recent equity capital invested as well as the intrinsic value of the applicable portfolio company&#8217;s particular technology, service or customer base. We secure our lien position against the enterprise value of each portfolio company. &#160;

&#8226; Creative products with attractive risk-adjusted pricing. Each of our existing and prospective portfolio companies has its own unique funding needs for the capital provided from the proceeds of our Venture Loans. These funding needs include funds for additional development &#8220;runways,&#8221; funds to hire or retain sales staff or funds to invest in research and development in order to reach important technical milestones in advance of raising additional equity. Our loans include current-pay interest, commitment fees, end-of-term payments, or ETPs, pre-payment fees, success fees and non-utilization fees. We believe we have developed pricing tools, structuring techniques and valuation metrics that satisfy our portfolio companies&#8217; financing requirements while mitigating risk and maximizing returns on our investments. &#160;

&#8226; Opportunity for enhanced returns. To enhance our debt investment portfolio returns, in addition to interest and fees, we obtain warrants to purchase the equity of our portfolio companies as additional consideration for making debt investments. The warrants we obtain generally include a &#8220;cashless exercise&#8221; provision to allow us to exercise these rights without requiring us to make any additional cash investment. Obtaining warrants in our portfolio companies has allowed us to participate in the equity appreciation of our portfolio companies, which we expect will enable us to generate higher returns for our investors. &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Direct origination. We originate transactions directly with technology, life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech companies. These transactions are referred to our Advisor from a number of sources, including referrals from, or direct solicitation of, venture capital and private equity firms, portfolio company management teams, legal firms, accounting firms, investment banks and other lenders that represent companies within our Target Industries. Our Advisor has been the sole or lead originator in substantially all transactions in which the funds it manages have invested. &#160;

&#8226; Disciplined and balanced underwriting and portfolio management. We use a disciplined underwriting process that includes obtaining information validation from multiple sources, extensive knowledge of our Target Industries, comparable industry valuation metrics and sophisticated financial analysis related to development-stage companies. Our Advisor&#8217;s due diligence on investment prospects includes obtaining and evaluating information on the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s technology, market opportunity, management team, fund raising history, investor support, valuation considerations, financial condition and projections. We seek to balance our investment portfolio to reduce the risk of down market cycles associated with any particular industry or sector, development-stage or geographic area. Our Advisor employs a &#8220;hands on&#8221; approach to portfolio management requiring private portfolio companies to provide monthly financial information and to participate in regular updates on performance and future plans. &#160;

&#8226; Use of leverage. We use leverage to increase returns on equity through our Key Facility, our 2019 Notes and our 2013-1 Securitization. See &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and capital resources&#8221; for additional information about our use of leverage. In addition, we may issue additional debt securities or preferred stock in one or more series in the future. &#160; 

Market opportunity 

&#160;

We focus our investments primarily in four key industries of the emerging technology market: technology, life science, healthcare information and services and cleantech. The technology sectors we focus on include communications, networking, data storage, software, cloud computing, semiconductor, power management, internet and media and consumer-related technologies. The life science sectors we focus on include biotechnology, drug delivery, bioinformatics and medical devices. The healthcare information and services sectors we focus on include diagnostics, medical record services and software and other healthcare related services and technologies that improve efficiency and quality of administered healthcare. The cleantech sectors we focus on include alternative energy, water purification, energy efficiency, green building materials and waste recycling. We refer to all of these companies as &#8220;technology-related&#8221; companies and intend, under normal market conditions, to invest at least 80% of the value of our total assets in such businesses.

&#160;

We believe that Venture Lending has the potential to achieve enhanced returns that are attractive notwithstanding the high degree of risk associated with lending to development-stage companies. Potential benefits include:

&#160;

&#8226; interest rates that typically exceed rates that would be available to portfolio companies if they could borrow in traditional commercial financing transactions; &#160;

&#8226; the debt investment support provided by cash proceeds from equity capital invested by venture capital and private equity firms; &#160;

&#8226; relatively rapid amortization of principal; &#160;

&#8226; senior ranking to equity and collateralization of debt investments to minimize potential loss of capital; and &#160;

&#8226; potential equity appreciation through warrants. &#160;

We believe that Venture Lending also provides an attractive financing source for portfolio companies, their management teams and their equity capital investors, as it:

&#160;

&#8226; is typically less dilutive to the equity holders than additional equity financing; &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; extends the time period during which a portfolio company can operate before seeking additional equity capital or pursuing a sale transaction or other liquidity event; and &#160;

&#8226; allows portfolio companies to better match cash sources with uses. &#160; 

Competitive strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we, together with our Advisor, possess significant competitive strengths, including:

&#160; 

Consistently execute commitments and close transactions. Our Advisor and its senior management and investment professionals have an extensive track record of originating, underwriting and managing Venture Loans. Our Advisor and its predecessor have directly originated, underwritten and managed Venture Loans with an aggregate original principal amount over $1.2 billion to more than 200 companies since operations commenced in 2004.

&#160; 

Robust direct origination capabilities. Our Advisor&#8217;s managing directors each has significant experience originating Venture Loans in our Target Industries. This experience has given each managing director a deep knowledge of our Target Industries and an extensive base of transaction sources and references.

&#160; 

Highly experienced and cohesive management team. Our Advisor has had the same senior management team of experienced professionals since its inception. This consistency allows companies, their management teams and their investors to rely on consistent and predictable service, loan products and terms and underwriting standards.

&#160; 

Relationships with venture capital and private equity investors. Our Advisor has developed strong relationships with venture capital and private equity firms and their partners.

&#160; 

Well-known brand name. Our Advisor has originated Venture Loans to more than 200 companies in our Target Industries under the &#8220;Horizon Technology Finance&#8221; brand.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We compete to provide financing to development-stage companies in our Target Industries with a number of investment funds and other BDCs, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other financing sources. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe we compete effectively with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience, industry knowledge and contacts of our Advisor&#8217;s investment professionals, its responsiveness and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, its creative financing products and its customized investment terms. We do not intend to compete primarily on the interest rates we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable or lower than our rates. For additional information concerning our competitive position and competitive risks, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks related to our business and structure &#8212; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected and the value of your investment in us could decline.&#8221;

&#160; 

Investment criteria 

&#160;

We seek to invest in companies that are diversified by their stage of development, their Target Industries and sectors of Target Industries and their geographical location, as well as by the venture capital and private equity sponsors that support our portfolio companies. While we invest in companies at various stages of development, we require that prospective portfolio companies be beyond the seed stage of development and have received at least their first round of venture capital or private equity financing before we will consider making an investment. We expect a prospective portfolio company to demonstrate its ability to advance technology and increase its value over time.

&#160;

We have identified several criteria that we believe have proven, and will prove, important in achieving our investment objective. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, we caution you that not all of these criteria are met by each portfolio company in which we choose to invest.

&#160; 

Management. Our portfolio companies are generally led by experienced management that has in-market expertise in the Target Industry in which the company operates, as well as extensive experience with development-stage companies. The adequacy and completeness of the management team is assessed relative to the stage of development and the challenges facing the potential portfolio company.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Continuing support from one or more venture capital and private equity investors. We typically invest in companies in which one or more established venture capital and private equity investors have previously invested and continue to make a contribution to the management of the business. We believe that established venture capital and private equity investors can serve as a committed partner and will assist their portfolio companies and their management teams in creating value. We take into consideration the total amount raised by the company, the valuation history, investor reserves for future investment and the expected timing and milestones to the next equity round financing.

&#160; 

Operating plan and cash resources. We generally require that a prospective portfolio company, in addition to having sufficient access to capital to support leverage, demonstrate an operating plan capable of generating cash flows or the ability to raise the additional capital necessary to cover its operating expenses and service its debt. Our review of the operating plan will take into consideration existing cash, cash burn, cash runway and the milestones necessary for the company to achieve cash flow positive operations or to access additional equity from the investors.

&#160; 

Enterprise and technology value. We expect that the enterprise value of a prospective portfolio company should substantially exceed the principal balance of debt borrowed by the company. Enterprise value includes the implied valuation based upon recent equity capital invested as well as the intrinsic value of the company&#8217;s particular technology, service or customer base.

&#160; 

Market opportunity and exit strategy. We seek portfolio companies that are addressing large market opportunities that capitalize on their competitive advantages. Competitive advantages may include unique technology, protected intellectual property, superior clinical results or significant market traction. As part of our investment analysis, we typically also consider potential realization of our warrants through merger, acquisition or initial public offering based upon comparable exits in the company&#8217;s Target Industry.

&#160; 

Investment process 

&#160;

Our Board has delegated authority for all investment decisions to our Advisor. Our Advisor, in turn, has created an integrated approach to the loan origination, underwriting, approval and documentation process that we believe effectively combines the skills of our Advisor&#8217;s professionals. This process allows our Advisor to achieve an efficient and timely closing of an investment from the initial contact with a prospective portfolio company through the investment decision, close of documentation and funding of the investment, while ensuring that our Advisor&#8217;s rigorous underwriting standards are consistently maintained. We believe that the high level of involvement by our Advisor&#8217;s staff in the various phases of the investment process allows us to minimize the credit risk while delivering superior service to our portfolio companies.

&#160; 

Origination. Our Advisor&#8217;s loan origination process begins with its industry-focused regional managing directors who are responsible for identifying, contacting and screening prospects. These managing directors meet with key decision makers and deal referral sources such as venture capital and private equity firms and management teams, legal firms, accounting firms, investment banks and other lenders to source prospective portfolio companies. We believe our brand name and management team are well known within the Venture Lending community, as well as by many repeat entrepreneurs and board members of prospective portfolio companies. These broad relationships, which reach across the Venture Lending industry, give rise to a significant portion of our Advisor&#8217;s deal origination.

&#160;

The responsible managing director of our Advisor obtains review materials from the prospective portfolio company and from those materials, as well as other available information, determines whether it is appropriate for our Advisor to issue a non-binding term sheet. The managing director bases this decision to proceed on his or her experience, the competitive environment and the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s needs and also seeks the counsel of our Advisor&#8217;s senior management and investment team.

&#160; 

Term sheet. If the managing director determines, after review and consultation with senior management, that the potential transaction meets our Advisor&#8217;s initial credit standards, our Advisor will issue a non-binding term sheet to the prospective portfolio company.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The terms of the transaction are tailored to a prospective portfolio company&#8217;s specific funding needs while taking into consideration market dynamics, the quality of the management team, the venture capital and private equity investors involved and applicable credit criteria, which may include the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s existing cash resources, the development of its technology and the anticipated timing for the next round of equity financing.

&#160; 

Underwriting. Once the term sheet has been negotiated and executed and the prospective portfolio company has remitted a good faith deposit, we request additional due diligence materials from the prospective portfolio company and arrange for a due diligence visit.

&#160; 

Due diligence. The due diligence process includes a formal visit to the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s location and interviews with the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s senior management team. The process includes obtaining and analyzing information from independent third parties that have knowledge of the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s business, including, to the extent available analysts that follow the technology market, thought leaders in our Target Industries and important customers or partners, if any. Outside sources of information are reviewed, including industry publications, scientific and market articles, Internet publications, publicly available information on competitors or competing technologies and information known to our Advisor&#8217;s investment team from their experience in the technology markets.

&#160;

A key element of the due diligence process is interviewing key existing investors in the prospective portfolio company, who are often also members of the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s board of directors. While these board members and/or investors are not independent sources of information, their support for management and willingness to support the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s further development are critical elements of our decision making process.

&#160; 

Investment memorandum. Upon completion of the due diligence process and review and analysis of all of the information provided by the prospective portfolio company and obtained externally, our Advisor&#8217;s assigned credit officer prepares an investment memorandum for review and approval. The investment memorandum is reviewed by our Advisor&#8217;s Chief Investment Officer and submitted to our Advisor&#8217;s investment committee for approval.

&#160; 

Investment committee. Our Advisor&#8217;s investment committee is responsible for overall credit policy, portfolio management, approval of all investments, portfolio monitoring and reporting and managing of problem accounts. The committee interacts with the entire staff of our Advisor to review potential transactions and deal flow. This interaction of cross-functional members of our Advisor&#8217;s staff assures efficient transaction sourcing, negotiating and underwriting throughout the transaction process. Portfolio performance and current market conditions are reviewed and discussed by the investment committee on a regular basis to assure that transaction structures and terms are consistent and current.

&#160; 

Loan closing and funding. Approved investments are documented and closed by our Advisor&#8217;s in-house legal and loan administration staff. Loan documentation is based upon standard templates created by our Advisor and is customized for each transaction to reflect the specific deal terms. The transaction documents typically include a loan and security agreement, warrant agreement and applicable perfection documents, including applicable Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC, financing statements and, as applicable, may also include a landlord agreement, patent and trademark security grants, a subordination agreement and other standard agreements for commercial loans in the Venture Lending industry. Funding requires final approval by our Advisor&#8217;s General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer or President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer.

&#160;

&#160; Portfolio management and reporting. Our Advisor maintains a &#8220;hands on&#8221; approach to maintain communication with our portfolio companies. At least quarterly, our Advisor contacts our portfolio companies for operational and financial updates by phone and performs reviews. Our Advisor may contact portfolio companies deemed to have greater credit risk on a monthly basis. Our Advisor requires all private companies to provide financial statements. For public companies, our Advisor typically relies on publicly reported quarterly financials. This allows our Advisor to identify any unexpected developments in the financial performance or condition of our portfolio company . 

&#160;

Our Advisor has developed a proprietary internal credit rating system to analyze the quality of our debt investments. Using this system, our Advisor analyzes and then rates the credit risk within the portfolio on a monthly basis. Each portfolio company is rated on a 1 through 4 scale, with 3 representing the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 4 represents an improved and better credit quality. A rating of 2 or 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and increasing risk. Newly funded investments are typically assigned a rating of 3, unless extraordinary circumstances require otherwise. These investment ratings are generated internally by our Advisor, and we cannot guarantee that others would assign the same ratings to our portfolio investments or similar portfolio investments.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Advisor closely monitors portfolio companies rated a 1 or 2 for adverse developments. In addition, our Advisor maintains regular contact with the management, board of directors and major equity holders of these portfolio companies in order to discuss strategic initiatives to correct the deterioration of the portfolio company.

&#160;

The following table describes each rating level: 

&#160;

Rating &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; The portfolio company has performed in excess of our expectations at the time of initial underwriting as demonstrated by exceeding revenue milestones, clinical milestones or other operating metrics or as a result of raising capital well in excess of our underwriting assumptions. Generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following: its enterprise value greatly exceeds our loan balance; it has achieved cash flow positive operations or has sufficient cash resources to cover the remaining balance of the loan; there is strong potential for warrant gains from our warrants; and there is a high likelihood that the borrower will receive favorable future financing to support operations. Loans rated 4 are the lowest risk profile in our portfolio, and there is no expected risk of principal loss. 3 &#160; &#160; The portfolio company has performed to our expectations at the time of initial underwriting as demonstrated by meeting revenue milestones, clinical milestones or other operating metrics. It has raised, or is expected to raise, capital consistent with our underwriting assumptions. Generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following: its enterprise value comfortably exceeds our loan balance; it has sufficient cash resources to operate according to its plan; it is expected to raise additional capital as needed; and there continues to be potential for warrant gains from our warrants. New loans are typically rated 3 when approved and thereafter 3-rated loans represent a standard risk profile, with no loss currently expected. 2 &#160; &#160; The portfolio company has performed below our expectations at underwriting as demonstrated by missing revenue milestones, delayed clinical progress or otherwise failing to meet projected operating metrics. It may have raised capital in support of the poorer performance but generally on less favorable terms than originally contemplated at the time of underwriting. Generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following: its enterprise value exceeds our loan balance but at a lower multiple than originally expected; it has sufficient cash to operate according to its plan but liquidity may be tight; and it is planning to raise additional capital but there is uncertainty and the potential for warrant gains from our warrants are possible, but unlikely. Loans rated 2 represent an increased level of risk. While no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated loan, there is potential for future loss of principal. 1 &#160; &#160; The portfolio company has performed well below plan as demonstrated by materially missing revenue milestones, delayed or failed clinical progress or otherwise failing to meet operating metrics. The portfolio company has not raised sufficient capital to operate effectively or retire its debt obligation to us. Generally the portfolio company displays one or more of the following: its enterprise value may not exceed our loan balance; it has insufficient cash to operate according to its plan and liquidity may be tight; and there are uncertain plans to raise additional capital or the portfolio company is being sold under distressed conditions. There is no potential for warrant gains from our warrants. Loans rated 1 are generally put on non-accrual status and represent a high degree of risk of loss. &#160;

&#160; 

Managerial assistance 

&#160;

As a BDC, we offer, through our Advisor, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance may involve monitoring the operations of the portfolio companies, participating in board of directors and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Although we may receive fees for these services, pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we will reimburse our Advisor for its expenses related to providing such services on our behalf.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We do not have any employees. Each of our executive officers is an employee of our Advisor. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Advisor. We reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, as our Administrator, including our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs.

&#160; 

Investment Management Agreement 

&#160;

Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, our Advisor:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights. &#160;

Our Advisor&#8217;s services under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.

&#160; 

Investment advisory fees 

&#160;

Pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement, we pay our Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of a base management fee and an incentive fee.

&#160; 

Base management fee. The base management fee, payable monthly in arrears, is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of (i) our gross assets less (ii) cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, the term &#8220;gross assets&#8221; includes any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage.

&#160;

The Advisor agreed to waive the base management fee relating to the proceeds raised in a public offering of our common stock that closed on March 24, 2015, to the extent such fee is not otherwise waived and regardless of the application of the proceeds raised, until the earlier to occur of (i) March 31, 2016 or (ii) the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which our net investment income exceeds distributions declared on shares of our common stock for the applicable quarter. As of December 31, 2015, condition (ii) above has been met, as our net investment income exceeded distributions declared for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, and our Advisor is not obligated to waive the base management fee with respect to such offering proceeds for any future quarter.

&#160; 

Incentive fee. The incentive fee has two parts, as follows:

&#160;

The first part, which is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, as defined below, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, &#8220;Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#8221; means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income we have not yet received in cash. The incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is 20.00% of the amount, if any, by which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of such quarter, exceeds a 1.75% (which is 7.00% annualized) hurdle rate and a &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, the Advisor receives no incentive fee until the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals the hurdle rate of 1.75%, but then receives, as a &#8220;catch-up,&#8221; 100.00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%. The effect of this &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is that, if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, the Advisor will receive 20.00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the hurdle rate did not apply.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter in which we incur a loss. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee up to the Incentive Fee Cap, defined below, even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2.00% base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter.

&#160;

Commencing with the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2014, the incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a fee cap and deferral mechanism which is determined based upon a look-back period of up to three years and is expensed when incurred. For this purpose, the Incentive Fee Look-back Period commenced on July 1, 2014 and increases by one quarter in length at the end of each calendar quarter until June 30, 2017, after which time, the Incentive Fee Look-back Period will include the relevant calendar quarter and the 11 preceding full calendar quarters. Each quarterly incentive fee payable on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a cap (the &#8220;Incentive Fee Cap&#8221;) and a deferral mechanism through which the Advisor may recoup a portion of such deferred incentive fees (collectively, the &#8220;Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism&#8221;). The Incentive Fee Cap is equal to (a) 20.00% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to the Advisor during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any calendar quarter, we will not pay an incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to the Advisor in that quarter. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap, the payment of such fees will be deferred and paid in subsequent calendar quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to certain limitations, which are set forth in the Investment Management Agreement. We only pay incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. &#8220;Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return&#8221; during any Incentive Fee Look-back Period means the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and the base management fee for each calendar quarter during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains and losses, cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and cumulative unrealized capital depreciation during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period.

&#160;

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

&#160;

&#160; 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income allocated to first part of incentive fee 

&#160;

The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of our election to be a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less all previous amounts paid in respect of the capital gain incentive fee.

Examples of incentive fee calculation 

&#160; 

Example 1: Income related portion of incentive fee before total return requirement calculation for each fiscal quarter 

&#160; 

Alternative 1 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 1.25%

&#160;

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.50%

&#160;

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate; therefore, there is no income-related incentive fee.

&#160; 

Alternative 2 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 2.80%

&#160;

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.50%

&#160;

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.10%

&#160;

Incentive fee = 100.00% &#215; Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221;) (4) 

&#160;

= 100.00% &#215; (2.10% - 1.75%)

&#160;

= 0.35%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision; therefore, the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.35%.

&#160; 

Alternative 3 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 3.00%

&#160;

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.50%

&#160;

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.30%

&#160;

Incentive fee = 100.00% &#215; Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to &#8220;catch-up&#8221;) (4) 

&#160;

Incentive fee = 100.00% &#215; &#8220;catch-up&#8221; + (20.00% &#215; (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - 2.1875%))

&#160;

Catch up = 2.1875% - 1.75%

&#160;

= 0.4375%

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Incentive fee = (100.00% &#215; 0.4375%) + (20.00% &#215; (2.30% - 2.1875%))

&#160;

= 0.4375% + (20.00% &#215; 0.1125%)

&#160;

= 0.4375% + 0.0225%

&#160;

= 0.46%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate and fully satisfies the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision; therefore, the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.46%.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (1) Represents 7.00% annualized hurdle rate. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) Represents 2.00% annualized base management fee. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (4) The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide our Advisor with an incentive fee of 20.00% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any fiscal quarter. &#160; 

Example 2: Income related portion of incentive fee after total return requirement calculation for each fiscal quarter 

&#160; 

Alternative 1 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 1.25%

&#160;

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.50%

&#160;

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate; therefore, there is no income-related incentive fee.

&#160;

Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid since July 1, 2014 = $9,000,000

&#160;

20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since July 1, 2014 = $8,000,000

&#160;

Although our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% (as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above), no incentive fee is payable because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since July 1, 2014 did not exceed the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid since July 1, 2014.

&#160; 

Alternative 2 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 2.80%

&#160;

Hurdle rate (1) = 1.75%

&#160;

Management fee (2) = 0.50%

&#160;

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.10%

&#160;

Incentive fee = 100.00% &#215; Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to &#8216;&#8216;catch-up&#8217;&#8217;) (4) 

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

=100.00% &#215; (2.10% - 1.75%)

&#160;

= 0.35%

&#160;

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#8216;&#8216;catch-up&#8217;&#8217; provision; therefore, the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.35%.

&#160;

Cumulative incentive compensation accrued and/or paid since July 1, 2014 = $9,000,000

&#160;

20.0% of cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since July 1, 2014 = $10,000,000

&#160;

Because our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% and because 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations since July 1, 2014 exceeds the cumulative income and capital gains incentive fees accrued and/or paid since July 1, 2014, an incentive fee would be payable, as shown in Alternative 3 of Example 1 above.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (1) Represents 7.00% annualized hurdle rate. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) Represents 2.00% annualized base management fee. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (4) The &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is intended to provide our Advisor with an incentive fee of 20.00% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any fiscal quarter. &#160; 

Example 3: Capital gains portion of incentive fee 

&#160; 

Alternative 1 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;)

&#160;

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million

&#160;

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million

&#160;

Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million

&#160;

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee, if any, would be:

&#160;

Year 1: None (No sales transaction)

&#160;

Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%)

&#160;

Year 3: None; $5 million ((20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2))

&#160;

Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million (($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2))

&#160; 

Alternative 2 

&#160;

Assumptions :

&#160;

Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#8220;Investment C&#8221;)

&#160;

Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million

&#160;

Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million

&#160;

Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million

&#160;

The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be:

&#160;

Year 1: None (no sales transaction)

&#160;

Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee (20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B))

&#160;

Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) ($6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2

&#160;

Year 4: None (no sales transaction)

&#160;

Year 5: None ($5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3 (2) 

&#160;

The hypothetical amounts of returns shown are based on a percentage of our total net assets and assume no leverage. There is no guarantee that positive returns will be realized and actual returns may vary from those shown in this example.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if we were to be wound up on a date other than our fiscal year end of any year, we may have paid aggregate capital gains incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if we had been wound up on its fiscal year end of such year. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (2) As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by our Advisor ($6.4 million) is effectively greater than $5 million (20.00% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($25 million)). &#160; 

Payment of our expenses 

&#160;

All investment professionals and staff of our Advisor, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of its personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by our Advisor. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:

&#160;

Generally, our expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. To the extent we incur costs that should be capitalized and amortized into expense we also do so in accordance with GAAP, which may include amortizing such amount on a straight line basis over the life of the asset or the life of the services or product being performed or provided.

&#160; 

Limitation of liability and indemnification 

&#160;

The Investment Management Agreement provides that our Advisor and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with our Advisor are not liable to us for any act or omission by it in the supervision or management of our investment activities or for any loss sustained by us except for acts or omissions constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations under the Investment Management Agreement. The Investment Management Agreement also provides for indemnification by us of our Advisor and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with our Advisor for liabilities incurred by them in connection with their services to us (including any liabilities associated with an action or suit by or in the right of us or our stockholders), but excluding liabilities for acts or omissions constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties under the Investment Management Agreement subject to certain conditions.

&#160; 

Board approval of the Investment Management Agreement 

&#160;

Our Board held an in-person meeting on July 29, 2015, at which it considered and reapproved our Investment Management Agreement for an additional 12-month period. In its consideration of the Investment Management Agreement, our Board focused on information it had received relating to (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our Advisor; (b) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; (c) our projected expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our Advisor or the Administrator from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Management Agreement; (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of our Advisor and its affiliates; (g) our Advisor&#8217;s practices regarding the selection and compensation of brokers that may execute our portfolio transactions and the brokers&#8217; provision of brokerage and research services to our Advisor; and (h) the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third party service providers or through an internally managed structure.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Based on the information reviewed and its discussions related thereto, our Board, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of us, concluded that the investment management fee rates were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided.

&#160; 

Duration and termination 

&#160;

The Investment Management Agreement was reapproved by our Board on July 29, 2015. Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will continue in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our Board including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty by delivering notice of termination upon not more than 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks related to our business and structure &#8212; Our Advisor can resign on 60 days&#8217; notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.&#8221;

&#160; 

Administration Agreement 

&#160;

The Administration Agreement was considered and reapproved by our Board on July 29, 2015. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs.

&#160; 

License agreement 

&#160;

We have entered into a license agreement with Horizon Technology Finance, LLC, or HTF, pursuant to which we were granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the service mark &#8220;Horizon Technology Finance.&#8221; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the &#8220;Horizon Technology Finance&#8221; service mark for so long as the Investment Management Agreement with our Advisor is in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the &#8220;Horizon Technology Finance&#8221; service mark.

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160;

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by &#8220;a majority of our outstanding voting securities&#8221; as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of such company&#8217;s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company. Our bylaws provide for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders at which such action could be considered upon written notice of not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting.

&#160;

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without stockholder approval.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. For example, under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates may be precluded from co-investing in private placements of securities. As a result of one or more of these situations, we may not be able to invest as much as we otherwise would in certain investments or may not be able to liquidate a position as quickly.

&#160;

We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

&#160;

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office.

&#160;

We and our Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We and our Advisor have designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.

&#160; 

Qualifying assets 

&#160;

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: &#160;

&#8226; is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; &#160;

&#8226; is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and &#160;

&#8226; satisfies any of the following: &#160;

&#8226; has a market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; &#160;

&#8226; is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result thereof, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or &#160;

&#8226; is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million. &#160;

&#8226; Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. &#160;

&#8226; Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. &#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. &#160;

&#8226; Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160;

&#8226; Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. &#160;

The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.

&#160; 

Managerial assistance to portfolio companies 

&#160;

A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in &#8220;&#8212; Qualifying assets.&#8221; However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.

&#160; 

Issuance of additional shares 

&#160;

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or issue and sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities. Our stockholder approval to sell shares of our common stock below its net asset value expired on January 21, 2016. We intend to seek approval from our stockholders to offer shares of our common stock below its net asset value in the future.

&#160; 

Temporary investments 

&#160;

Pending investment in other types of &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, subject to certain exceptions, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we generally would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Advisor monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Senior securities; derivative securities 

&#160;

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities are outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage requirement at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8212; Risks related to our business and structure &#8212; We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.&#8221;

&#160;

The 1940 Act also limits the amount of warrants, options and rights to common stock that we may issue and the terms of such securities.

&#160; 

Code of ethics 

&#160;

We and our Advisor have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#8217;s requirements. You may read and copy the code of ethics at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 942-8090. In addition, each code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to our Pre-effective Amendment No. 3 to the registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-165570 filed with the SEC on July 19, 2010 as Exhibits (r)(1) and (r)(2)), which is available on the SEC&#8217;s Internet site at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov , or by writing the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.

&#160; 

Proxy voting policies and procedures 

&#160;

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Advisor and our independent directors and, accordingly, are subject to change.

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160;

Our Advisor is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Advisor has fiduciary duties to us. As part of this duty, our Advisor recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Our Advisor&#8217;s proxy voting policies and procedures have been formulated to ensure decision-making is consistent with these fiduciary duties.

&#160;

These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.

&#160; 

Proxy policies 

&#160;

Our Advisor votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what our Advisor perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Advisor reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our Advisor generally votes against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, our Advisor may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.

&#160;

Our Advisor&#8217;s proxy voting decisions are made by those senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that a vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Advisor requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Proxy voting records 

&#160;

You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, Horizon Technology Finance Corporation, 312 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, Connecticut 06032 or by calling (860) 676-8654.

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

&#160;

&#8226; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#160;

&#8226; pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#160;

&#8226; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm; and &#160;

&#8226; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. &#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and intend to take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

&#160; 

NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance regulations 

&#160;

NASDAQ has adopted corporate governance regulations with which listed companies must comply. We intend to be in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards. We intend to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.

&#160; 

Privacy principles 

&#160;

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of stockholders and to safeguarding our non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.

&#160;

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).

&#160;

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to our Advisor&#8217;s employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders.

&#160; 

Election to be taxed as a RIC 

&#160;

We have elected to be taxed, and intend to qualify annually to maintain our election to be taxed, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must, among other requirements, meet certain source-of-income and quarterly asset diversification requirements (as described below). We also must distribute dividends each tax year of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains (i.e. net short-term capital gains in excess of net long term losses), or investment company taxable income, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution, which we refer to as the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement.&#8221; Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we are required to distribute dividends in respect of each calendar year of an amount generally at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess of our capital gains over our capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we previously did not pay U.S. federal corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. In addition, although we may distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may decide to retain such net capital gains or ordinary income to provide us with additional liquidity. In order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes under Section 851(a) of the Code, we must:

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; maintain an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each tax year; &#160;

&#8226; meet any applicable securities law requirements, including capital structure requirements; &#160;

&#8226; derive in each tax year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the Qualifying Income Test; and &#160;

&#8226; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the tax year: &#160;

&#8226; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer neither represent more than 5% of the value of our assets nor more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#160;

&#8226; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in certain qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the Diversification Tests. &#160; 

Taxation as a RIC 

&#160;

If we qualify as a RIC under Section 851(a) of the Code, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we are not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income as well as any net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we distribute as dividends to stockholders. We may retain for investment all or a portion of our net capital gain. However, if we retain any investment company taxable income or net capital gains, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on any amounts retained. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive tax years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent tax year, we may be subject to regular corporate rates on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the tax year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five tax years.

&#160;

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment in kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each tax year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same tax year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the tax year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.

&#160;

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.

&#160; 

Failure to qualify as a RIC 

&#160;

If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or fail to qualify as a RIC in any tax year, assuming we do not qualify for or take advantage of certain remedial provisions, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of our income will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. In contrast, assuming we qualify as a RIC, our corporate-level federal income tax liability should be substantially reduced or eliminated. See &#8220;&#8212;Election to be taxed as a RIC&#8221; above.

&#160;

If we are unable to maintain our status as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary distribution income eligible for the 15% or 20% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, dividends paid by us to certain corporate distributes would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis in our common stock, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
