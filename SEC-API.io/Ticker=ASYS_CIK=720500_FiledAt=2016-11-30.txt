 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

OUR COMPANY 

We are a leading, global manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing, silicon wafer handling automation, and related consumables used in fabricating solar cells, LED and semiconductor devices. Semiconductors, or semiconductor chips, are fabricated on silicon wafer substrates, sliced from ingots, and are part of the circuitry, or electronic components, of many products including solar cells, computers, telecommunications devices, automotive products, consumer goods, and industrial automation and control systems. The Company's wafer handling, thermal processing and consumable products currently address the diffusion, oxidation, and deposition steps, including atomic layer deposition used in the fabrication of solar cells, LEDs, semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems (&#8220;MEMS&#8221;) and the polishing of newly sliced silicon wafers. 

Our major emphasis in the solar industry is the development of thermal processes, and deposition for solar cell manufacturing, which we believe, collectively, are key to driving higher cell efficiencies. The markets we serve are experiencing rapid technological advances and are, historically, cyclical. Therefore, future profitability and growth depend on our ability to develop or acquire and market profitable new technology products, and on our ability to adapt to cyclical trends. 

We believe our product portfolio, developed through a track record of technological innovation as well as the successful integration of key acquisitions, reduces the cost of solar cell manufacturing by increasing solar cell efficiency, increasing throughput and increasing yields. We have been providing manufacturing solutions to the semiconductor industry for over 30 years and have leveraged our semiconductor technology and industry presence to capitalize on growth opportunities in the solar industry. Our customers use our equipment to manufacture solar cells, semiconductors, silicon wafers and MEMS, which are used in end markets such as solar power, telecommunications, consumer electronics, computers, automotive and mobile hand-held devices. Through the acquisition of BTU International, Inc. ("BTU") in fiscal 2015, we expanded our thermal processing capability with the supply of solder reflow systems used for surface 

&#32;3 

mount and semiconductor packaging applications in the electronics assembly market, and custom equipment for multiple industrial markets. Also in fiscal 2015, we expanded our participation in the solar market through the acquisition of a controlling interest in SoLayTec B.V. ("SoLayTec"), which provides Atomic Layer Deposition ("ALD") systems used in high efficiency solar cells. To complement our research and development efforts, we also sell our equipment to, and coordinate certain development efforts with, research institutes, universities and customers. 

For fiscal 2016, we recognized net revenue of $120 million , which included $61 million &#32;of solar revenue or approximately 51% &#32;of our total revenue. These results compare to $105 &#32;million of net revenue for fiscal 2015, which included $57 million &#32;of solar revenue or approximately 54% &#32;of our total revenue. Our order backlog as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $49 million &#32;and $35 million , respectively, a 41% &#32;increase. Our backlog as of September 30, 2016 included approximately $34 million &#32;of orders and deferred revenue from our solar industry customers compared to $23 million &#32;from our solar industry customers as of September 30, 2015. Because our orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales in subsequent periods, nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from completing these orders. 

&#160; 

Orders from the solar industry totaled $76 million &#32;during fiscal 2016, compared to $61 million &#32;and $38 million &#32;in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The solar book to bill ratio for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 1.2:1 &#32;and 1.1:1 , respectively. 

&#160; 

Following the Company's acquisition of BTU, an evaluation was conducted of the Company's organizational structure. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company made changes to its reportable segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period segment reporting structure. The Company operates in three business segments: (i) solar, (ii) semiconductor and (iii) polishing. For information regarding net revenue, operating income and identifiable assets attributable to each of our three business segments for each of the past three fiscal years, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and "ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" in this Annual Report. For information on the products of each segment, see "Solar and Semiconductor Equipment Products" and "Polishing Supplies Products" within this "ITEM 1. BUSINESS" section. For information regarding risks to our business, see &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.&#8221; 

&#160; 

GROWTH STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Solar Industry by Leveraging Our Diffusion Furnace Market Share, Top-Tier Customer Relationships, and Track Record of Technological Innovation. We believe that long-term growth in the solar industry will be driven by several macro-economic factors, such as volatile energy prices, limited non-renewable energy resources, government incentives for solar generated electricity, increasing environmental awareness, energy security concerns and the expected decrease in the cost of solar energy. As the solar market continues to develop, advances in process technology will be vital to remaining competitive. We intend to continue leveraging our market position, relationships with leading global solar cell customers and demonstrated track record of technical innovation to maximize sales of our current and next-generation technology solutions. 

Develop Multi-Product Solutions to Expand Our Addressable Market. &#32;We are focused on acquiring, developing and licensing new products across our business in response to customer needs in the solar market. As we add to our product portfolio, we plan to continue expanding our offerings within the solar cell production process, thus capturing a greater percentage of capital spent on building global solar cell manufacturing capacity. Our successful development of PECVD (&#8220;Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition&#8221;) equipment is a recent example of meeting our customers' needs and expanding the size of our addressable market. 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions That Complement Our Strong Platform. &#32;Over the course of our history, we have developed an acquisition strategy consistent with our focus of maintaining market leadership and a technology roadmap leading to higher efficiency and lower cost solar cells. Based on our acquisition strategy, we continue to evaluate potential technology, product and business acquisitions or joint ventures that are intended to increase our existing market share in the solar, semiconductor and LED industries and expand our addressable market. In evaluating these opportunities, our objectives include: enhancing our earnings and cash flows, adding complementary product offerings, actively expanding our geographic footprint, improving our production efficiency and enhancing our customer base. 

Contribute to the Solar Industry's Mission of Reaching Grid Parity. We believe next-generation process technology for solar cell manufacturing is the driver to increasing efficiency and lowering manufacturing costs and is key to enabling 

&#32;4 

grid parity, where the cost of solar generated electricity is on parity with traditional, non-renewable sources of energy such as coal and natural gas. Our next-generation solar cell process technology has a demonstrated track record of increasing our customers' solar cell conversion efficiency. We will continue to develop next-generation solar cell manufacturing process technology that will enable our customers to displace non-renewable energy. 

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 

In December 2014, the Company expanded our participation in the solar market by acquiring a 51% controlling interest in SoLayTec, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which provides ALD systems used in high efficiency solar cells. The acquisition of the controlling interest in SoLayTec supports our business model of growth through strategic acquisition. 

In January 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of BTU, a Delaware corporation, pursuant to which BTU became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Amtech acquired all of the outstanding stock of BTU in an all-stock transaction. BTU stockholders received 0.3291 shares of Amtech common stock for every share of BTU stock. 

The addition of BTU supports our business model of growth through strategic acquisition and continuous innovation. The combination with BTU further positions the Company as a leading, global supplier of solar and semiconductor production and automation systems. The acquisition also further advances our strategy to expand our technology portfolio in adjacent markets and creates a strong platform to drive the growth of our solar business. With the addition of BTU, the Company has a more diversified and profitable revenue base, allowing the Company to better scale production and distribution of our solar technology to meet accelerating demand for next-generation technology solutions. 

In September 2015, we sold a portion of our interest in Kingstone Technology Hong Kong Limited (&#8220;Kingstone Hong Kong&#8221;) that is the parent company of Shanghai Kingstone (collectively with Kingstone Hong Kong, &#8220;Kingstone&#8221;), a Shanghai-based technology company specializing in ion implant solutions for the solar and semiconductor industries (in which we acquired a 55% ownership in February 2011), to a China-based venture capital firm. Proceeds from the sale of shares were paid to Amtech and used to support the company's core strategic initiatives. We now own 15% of the holding company, Kingstone Hong Kong, following consummation of the transaction, which effectively represents an 8% beneficial ownership interest in the Shanghai operating entity, Shanghai Kingstone. 

SOLAR INDUSTRY 

We provide process equipment and related cell manufacturing equipment to many of the world's leading solar cell manufacturers. 

Within process equipment, our primary focus is on our existing solar diffusion furnace and the development of next-generation diffusion furnaces, including our proprietary N-type, PECVD systems. Our N-type technology has been developed through a three-party research collaboration agreement with the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands, or ECN, a leading solar research center in Europe and Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited, or Yingli, one of the world's leading vertically integrated photovolataic (&#8220;PV&#8221;) product manufacturers. In 2012, we launched our PECVD system. Through our acquisition of SoLayTec, we produce, develop, and deliver and service worldwide machines for ultrafast ALD Equipment used in high efficiency solar cells. 

We also offer furnace automation and wafer handling systems used within the diffusion processing step of solar cell manufacturing. Our automation equipment includes mass wafer transfer systems, sorters, long-boat transfer systems, load station elevators, buffers and conveyers, which we sell both in connection with our diffusion furnaces and on a standalone basis. 

Most solar cell manufacturers sell their products to manufacturers of solar modules or solar panels. Others are vertically integrated and use their cells in the production of solar modules and panels. Solar cells are the critical component of solar modules and solar panels, which are sold to the end user and used in residential homes, industrial applications, remote pumping, lighting and heating uses and central power stations. 

&#32;5 

Although the solar market has experienced tremendous growth over the past five years, it is characterized by short-term periods of rapid capacity expansion followed by periods of rapid contraction in our customers' capital spending. When actual and expected end-user demand outstrips available capacity, this triggers the beginning of the next period of expansion. 

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY 

We provide diffusion equipment as well as handling, storage and automation equipment and related services to leading semiconductor manufacturers. Our products include horizontal and vertical diffusion furnaces used to produce semiconductors, silicon wafers and MEMS, as well as lapping equipment, polishing templates and wafer insert carriers, mass wafer transfer systems, loaders and sorters. 

Although the semiconductor market has experienced significant growth over the past fifteen years, it remains cyclical by nature. The market is characterized by short-term periods of under or over utilization of capacity for most semiconductors, including microprocessors, memory, power management chips and other logic devices. When capacity utilization decreases due to the addition of excess capacity, semiconductor manufacturers typically slow their purchasing of capital equipment. Conversely, when capacity utilization increases, so does capital spending. 

Most semiconductor chips are built on a silicon wafer, and include multiple layers of circuitry that connect a variety of circuit components, such as transistors, capacitors and other components. To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and remove selected film layers, including insulators. Similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer. These are all referred to as &#8220;front-end&#8221; processes. 

As demand for increasingly sophisticated electronic devices continues; new technologies such as wireless networks, next generation cellular phones and tablets will help to drive future growth. Electronic equipment continues to become more complex, yet end users are still demanding smaller, lighter and less expensive devices. This, in turn, requires increased performance and reduced cost, size, weight and power requirements of electronic assemblies, printed circuit boards and semiconductors. In response to these developments, manufacturers are increasingly employing more sophisticated production and assembly techniques requiring more advanced manufacturing equipment, such as that supplied by BTU. 

In the printed circuit board assembly process, semiconductor discrete-devices and various other components are attached to printed circuit boards. The attachment process, which creates a permanent physical and electrical bond, is called solder reflow or surface mount reflow. Manufacturers rely on high throughput and highly reliable equipment to get the maximum efficiency in their production process. Die level semiconductor packaging processes include precision thermal processing steps. Advancements in the semiconductor industry toward higher chip speeds, smaller form factors and reduced costs are driving the transition to wafer level packaging from the traditional wire bonding technique. 

SOLAR AND SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

Our furnace and automation equipment is manufactured in our facilities in The Netherlands, France, Massachusetts, and China. The following paragraphs describe the products that comprise our solar, semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment business: 

Horizontal Diffusion Furnaces. Through our subsidiaries, Tempress and Bruce Technologies, we produce and sell horizontal diffusion furnaces. Our horizontal furnaces currently address several steps in the solar and semiconductor manufacturing processes, including diffusion, phosphorus tetrachloride doping, or POCl 3 , boron tribromide, or BBR 3 , low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, or LPCVD, oxidation, and annealing. 

Our horizontal furnaces generally consist of three large modules: the load station where the loading of the wafers occurs; the furnace section, which is comprised of one to five thermal reactor chambers; and the gas distribution cabinet where the flow of gases into the reactor chambers is controlled, and often customized to meet the requirements of our customers' particular processes. The horizontal furnaces utilize a combination of existing industry and proprietary technologies and are sold primarily to solar customers and semiconductor customers who do not require the advanced automation of, or cannot justify the higher expense of, vertical furnaces for some or all of their diffusion processes. Our models are capable of processing all currently existing wafer sizes. 

&#32;6 

Automation Products - Solar &#38; Semiconductor. Our automation technology products are used in several of the diffusion steps and in the anneal processing step of solar cell manufacturing. Our R2D Automation equipment includes mass wafer transfer systems, sorters, long-boat transfer systems, load station elevators, buffers and conveyers. We use a vacuum technology in our Comet Standalone and our Comet Full Automation solar wafer transfer systems designed to ensure high throughput, reduced breakage and thereby increased yield. 

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). We have two applications in the solar device technology. Our solar PECVD product applies an anti-reflective coating to solar wafers; a coating critical to the efficiency of solar cells. PECVD layers are also used for passivation of the front and/or back side of the solar cell. We also offer the combination of tunnel oxide with a LPCVD of poly-layer, this is a new application in our solar roadmap towards efficiencies above 21%. These solar products add two solar cells processing step to Amtech's offerings. We are exploring next-generation high-efficiency technology and dedicating our efforts to that process development. 

Atomic Layer Deposition. We produce, develop, deliver and service worldwide machines for ultrafast, spatial (ALD)equipment, a promising technology for ultrathin Al2O3 passivation layers on solar cells. The ALD machines from SoLayTec are intended for industrial production in the solar market. As such, following the acquisition of the majority interest in SoLayTec, the Company is now able to use ALD in the industrial production and solar market due to technology that was previously unavailable to the Company prior to the acquisition due to the very low speed of ALD and the associated high cost. The unique feature of the SoLayTec machines is the breakthrough speed that enables industrial application. 

Automation Products - Semiconductor. Use of our automation products reduces human handling and, therefore, reduces exposure of wafers to particle sources during the loading and unloading of the process tubes and protects operators from heat and chemical fumes. The top reactor chamber of a horizontal furnace can be as much as eight feet from the floor on which the operator stands when manually loading wafer boats. Typical boats of 150mm to 300mm wafers weigh three to six pounds. Given these two factors, automating the wafer loading and unloading of a diffusion furnace improves employee safety and ergonomics in silicon wafer, solar cell and semiconductor manufacturing facilities. 

S-300. Our patented S-300 model provides a very efficient method of automatically transporting a full batch of up to 300 wafers to the designated tube level and automatically placing them directly onto the cantilever loader of a diffusion furnace at one time. This product is suitable for the production of nearly all semiconductors manufactured using a horizontal furnace. The S-300 can be used in conjunction with all current wafer sizes and is particularly well suited for manufacturers of 300mm wafers. 

Comet. Our Comet and Gemini series of wafer transfer systems include a wide range of throughputs and footprints to meet the needs of our customers who serve the semiconductor industry. Comet Sorter with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used in sorting, randomizing, compacting or tracking. The Comet Sorter is cassette to cassette with OCR front and back scribe functions, notch alignment and SECSII Gem communication. Comet ID Readers check tag carriers then read each wafer scribe. The Comet ID Reader sends the information to the host with SECSII Gem commands. 

Small Batch Vertical Furnace. Our small batch, two-tube vertical furnace was developed internally with the active support from a large semiconductor manufacturer and long-term customer. The specifications for this furnace include a two-tube vertical furnace for wafer sizes of up to 200mm, with each tube having a small flat zone capable of processing 25-50 wafers per run. We are targeting niche applications, including research and development, while we continue to develop additional processes, since the competition in the large batch vertical furnace market is intense and our competitors are much larger and have substantially greater financial resources, processing knowledge and advanced technology. 

Continuous Thermal Processing Systems. Through our BTU subsidiary, we produce and sell thermal processing systems used in the solder reflow and curing stages of printed circuit board assembly as well as systems for the thermal processes used in advanced semiconductor packaging. Our printed circuit board assembly products are used primarily in the advanced, high-density segments of the market that utilize surface mount technology. 

Flip-chip reflow provides the physical and electronic bond of the semiconductor device to its package. Our range of convection reflow systems, utilizing patented closed loop convection technology, rated at up to 400&#176;C and operate in air or nitrogen atmospheres. These products utilize forced impingement convection technology to transfer heat to the substrate. Using thermal power arrays of up to five-kilowatts, they can process substrates in dual lane, dual speed 

&#32;7 

configurations, thereby enabling our customers to double production without increasing the machine&#8217;s footprint. These products are available in four models based on the heated lengths of thermal processing chambers. Heated length is based on the required production rate and loading requirements. 

POLISHING SUPPLIES PRODUCTS 

O ur polishing supplies division provides solutions to the lapping and polishing marketplace. Lapping is the process of abrading components with a high degree of precision for flatness, parallelism and surface finish. Common applications for this technology are silicon wafers for semiconductor products, sapphire substrates for LED lighting and mobile devices, silicon carbide wafers for LED and power device applications, various glass and silica components for 3D image transmission, quartz and ceramic components for telecommunications devices, medical device components and computer hard disks. We manufacture the products described below in Pennsylvania and sell them under our PR Hoffman brand name. 

Wafer Carriers . &#32; Carriers are work holders into which silicon and sapphire wafers or other materials are inserted for the purpose of holding them securely in place during the lapping and polishing processes. We produce carriers for our line of lapping and polishing machines, as well as for those machines sold by our competitors. Substantially all of the carriers we produce are customized for specific applications. Insert carriers, our most significant category of carriers, contain plastic inserts molded onto the inside edge of the work-holes of the carrier, which hold the wafers in place during processing. Although our standard steel carriers are preferred in many applications because of their durability, rigidity and precise dimensions, they are typically not suited for applications involving softer materials or when metal contamination is an issue. Insert carriers, however, are well suited for processing large semiconductor wafers, up to 450mm in diameter, and other fragile materials or where contamination is an issue, because they provide the advantages of steel carriers while reducing the potential for damage to the edges of such sensitive materials. Our insert carriers are used for double-sided lapping or polishing of wafers up to 450mm in diameter. 

Semiconductor Polishing Templates . Our polishing templates are used to securely hold sapphire or other wafer materials in place during single-sided polishing processes. Polishing templates are customized for specific applications and are manufactured to exacting tolerances. We manufacture polishing templates for most brands of tools and various processes. In addition to silicon wafers, these products are used in polishing silicon carbide wafers and sapphire crystals used in LEDs, power devices as well as mobile communication applications. 

Double-Sided Planetary Lapping and Polishing Machines . Double-sided lapping and polishing machines are designed to process thin and fragile materials, such as semiconductor, sapphire and other wafer-like materials, precision optics, computer disk media and ceramic components for wireless communication devices, to exact tolerances of thickness, flatness, parallelism and surface finish. On average, we believe that we offer our surface processing systems with a lower cost of ownership than systems offered by our competitors. We target the LED, mobile device, semiconductor, optics, quartz, ceramics, medical, computer disk and metal working markets. 

MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES 

&#160; 

Our solar, semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of engineering design to meet specific and evolving customer needs, and procurement and assembly of various commercial and proprietary components into finished thermal processing systems and related automation in Vaassen, The Netherlands, Clapiers, France, North Billerica, Massachusetts, and Shanghai, China. 

Our manufacturing activities in the polishing supplies and equipment business include laser-cutting and other fabrication steps in producing lapping and polishing consumables, including carriers, templates, gears, wear items and spare parts in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from raw materials manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers. These products are engineered and designed for specific applications and to meet the increasingly tight tolerances required by our customers. Many items, such as proprietary components for our solar and semiconductor equipment and lapping plates, are also purchased from suppliers who manufacture these items to our specifications. 

Final assembly and tests of our equipment and machines are performed within our manufacturing facilities. Quality control is maintained through inspection of incoming materials and components, in-process inspection during equipment 

&#32;8 

assembly, testing of assemblies and final inspection and, when practical, operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment. 

Since much of our polishing supplies know-how relates to the manufacture of its products, this business' facility is equipped to perform a significantly higher percentage of the fabrication steps required in the production of its products. However, injection molding for our insert carriers and the manufacture of raw cast iron plates are subcontracted out to various third parties. Our polishing supplies business relies on key suppliers for certain materials, including two steel mills in Germany and Japan, an injection molder, a single-sourced pad supplier from Japan and an adhesive manufacturer. To minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts, we maintain appropriate inventories of key raw materials and parts. If for any reason we were unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet our production requirements, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

&#160; 

The markets we serve are characterized by evolving industry standards and rapid technological change. To compete effectively in our markets, we must continually maintain or exceed the pace of such change by improving our products and our process technologies and by developing new technologies and products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance. To assure that these technologies and products address current and future customer requirements, we obtain as much customer cooperation and input as possible, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our research and development efforts. In addition, we look for strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of SoLayTec, which will provide us with new technologies to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. 

From time to time we add functionality to our products or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer's order, in which case the cost of development, along with other costs of the order, are charged to cost of sales. We periodically receive research grants for research and development of products, which are netted against our research, development and engineering costs. Our expenditures (net of grants earned) that have been accounted for as research and development were $8.0 million (7% of net revenue) for fiscal 2016, $6.9 million (7% of net revenue) for fiscal 2015, and $6.3 million (11% of net revenue) for fiscal 2014.

&#160; 

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160; 

Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we market our products primarily by direct customer contact through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors that specialize in solar and semiconductor equipment and supplies. Our promotional activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows, an internet website, advertising in trade magazines and the distribution of product brochures. 

Through the acquisition of BTU, we have expanded our global sales and support infrastructure contributing to our competitive position. 

Sales to distributors are generally on terms comparable to sales to end user customers, as our distributors generally quote their customers after first obtaining a quote from us and have an order from the end-user before placing an order with us. Our sales to distributors are not contingent on their future sales and do not include a general right of return. Historically, returns have been rare. Distributors of our solar and semiconductor equipment do not stock a significant amount of our products, as the inventory they do hold is primarily limited to parts needed to provide timely repairs to the customer. 

&#32;10 

Payment terms of our parts, service and retrofit sales are generally net 30 days. The payment terms of equipment or systems sales vary depending on the size of the order and the size, reputation and creditworthiness of the customer. As a result, the financial terms of equipment sales can range from 80% due 30 days after shipment and 20% due 30 days after acceptance, to requiring a customer deposit 30 days after order placement, a portion due 30 days after shipment and the balance due 30 days after acceptance. Letters of credit are required of certain customers depending on the size of the order, creditworthiness of the customer and the customer's country of domicile. 

During fiscal 2016, 80% of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America. This group represented 74% of revenues in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, net revenue was distributed among customers in different geographic regions as follows: North/South America 20% (17% of which is in the United States), Asia 68% (including 28% to China 18% to Malaysia and 15% to Taiwan) and Europe 12%. In fiscal 2016, one customer individually accounted for 11% of net revenue. In fiscal 2015, two customers individually accounted for 15% and 11% of net revenue, respectively. In fiscal 2014, two customers individually accounted for 18% and 11% of net revenue, respectively. Our business is not seasonal in nature, but is cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of solar cell and semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on many factors, including capacity utilization, anticipated demand, the development of new technologies and global and regional economic conditions. See "Part 1 Financial Information, Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements, Footnote 8 Geographic Regions" for information regarding our net long-lived assets. 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

We compete in several distinct equipment markets for solar cells, semiconductor devices, semiconductor wafers, MEMS, electronics assembly, and the market for lapping and polishing machines and supplies used in the LED, mobile devices and semiconductor markets. Each of these markets is highly competitive. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to continually improve our products, processes and services, as well as our ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in these markets include the product's technical capability, productivity and cost-effectiveness, overall reliability, ease of use and maintenance, contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support. 

The Solar Cell, Semiconductor Device, and MEMS Markets . Our thermal processing equipment and automation primarily compete with those produced by other original equipment manufacturers, some of which are well-established firms that are much larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we have. Some of our competitors have a diversified product line, making it difficult to quantify their sales of products that compete directly with our products. Competitors of our horizontal diffusion furnaces include Centrotherm GmbH, Koyo Systems Co. Ltd., Sandvik Thermal Process, Inc., a subsidiary of Sandvik AB, 48th Institute, Sevenstar Electronics, CVD Equipment, Inc., Semco Engineering S.A., S.C New Energy, Meyer Burger, Ltd. and Expertech, Inc. We are experiencing increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers, including 48th Institute, S.C New Energy and Sevenstar Electronics, which may receive varying levels of financial support from the Chinese government. Our primary competitive advantages over such local manufacturers include our automation and higher-efficiency solar cell production technologies which we develop in collaboration with customers and research institutes. Also, our furnaces and lapping and polishing machines face, to a limited extent, competition from equipment on the low-end of the price spectrum. 

Our principal competitors for printed circuit board assembly equipment and advanced semiconductor packaging vary by product application. The principal competitors for solder reflow systems are Vitronics-Soltec, Heller, Folungwin, ERSA, and Rehm. The principal competitors for advanced semiconductor packaging are Vitronics-Soltec and Heller. Our in-line, controlled atmosphere furnaces compete primarily against products offered by Centrotherm, and SierraTherm/Schmid Thermal Systems. We also face competition from emerging low cost Asian manufacturers and other established European manufacturers. 

Although price is a factor in buying decisions, we believe that technological leadership, process capability, throughput, environmental safeguards, uptime, mean time-to-repair, cost of ownership and after-sale support have become increasingly important factors. We compete primarily on the basis of these criteria, rather than on the basis of price alone. 

&#32;11 

General Industrial Lapping and Polishing Machines, Supplies and Semiconductor Wafer Markets . We experience price competition for wafer carriers produced by foreign manufacturers for which there is very little publicly available information. As a result, we are intensifying our efforts to reduce the cost of our carriers and will continue to compete with other manufacturers of carriers by continuing to update our product line to keep pace with the rapid changes in our customers' requirements and by providing a high level of quality and customer service.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

EPA Accrual &#32;- As a result of the acquisition of BTU, the Company assumed BTU&#8217;s proportional responsibility for clean-up costs at a Superfund site. As an equipment manufacturer, BTU generated and disposed of small quantities of solid waste that were considered hazardous under Environment Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) regulations. Because BTU historically used a waste disposal firm that disposed of the solid waste at a site that the EPA designated as a Superfund site, BTU was named by the EPA as one of the entities responsible for a portion of the expected clean-up costs. Based on the Company's proportional responsibility, as negotiated with and agreed to by the EPA, the Company's liability related to this matter is less than $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2016, the remaining liability is $0.2 million, which is included in Other Accrued Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016. In 2009, in accordance with the settlement agreement with the EPA, BTU established a letter of credit for $0.2 million for the benefit of the EPA to secure potential cash payments as part of BTU's settlement of their proportional liability.
