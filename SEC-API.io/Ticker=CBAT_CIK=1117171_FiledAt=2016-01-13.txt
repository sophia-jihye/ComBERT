 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview of Our Business 

Our Dalian manufacturing facilities began its partial commercial operations in July 2015. We are now engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling new energy high power lithium batteries, which are mainly used in the following applications: 

&#160;

&#149; 

Electric vehicles (&#147;EV&#148;), such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; 

&#160;

&#149; 

Light electric vehicles (&#147;LEV&#148;), such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and 

&#160;

&#149; 

Electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other high power applications. 

We have received most of the operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies of our former subsidiary, BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. (&#147;BAK Tianjin&#148;). Such assets were acquired in exchange for a reduction in receivables from our former subsidiaries that were disposed in June 2014. We have outsourced and will continue to outsource our production to BAK Tianjin or other manufacturers until our Dalian manufacturing facility can fulfill our customers&#146; needs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, Dalian BAK Power purchased batteries of approximately of $10.5 million from BAK Tianjin and $1.2 million from other manufacturers.

We generated revenues of $13.9 million and $123.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We had a net profit of $37.8 million in 2014 and a net profit of $15.9 million in 2015 As of September 30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $125.9 million and net assets of $21.7 million. We had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses in prior years and short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of September 30, 2015.

In October 2014, we received from Dalian government a subsidy of RMB46.2 million for the costs of land use rights to be used to construct the new manufacturing site over the land use rights. In August 2014, we also obtained a one-year bank loan of RMB30 million. The short term bank loan was bearing a fixed interest rate at 7.80% per annum and was guaranteed by Mr. Xiangqian Li (&#147;Mr. Li&#148;), our CEO, and Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd., our former subsidiary (&#147;Shenzhen BAK&#148;). In June 2015, we received banking facilities from Bank of Dandong to provide a maximum loan amount of $12.6 million and bank acceptance and letters of credit of $5.0 million to June 2016. The banking facilities were guaranteed by Shenzhen BAK, Mr. Li and Ms. Xiaoqiu Yu, Mr Li&#146;s wife. The facilities were also secured by our Dalian site&#146;s prepaid land use rights, buildings, constructions in progress, machinery and equipment and pledged deposits. Under the banking facilities, on June 25, 2015 we borrowed a one-year term bank loan of RMB50 million (approximately $7.9 million), bearing fixed interest at 7.84% per annum under the banking facilities. On August 18, 2015, we repaid the loan of RMB30 million upon maturity and borrowed a new one-year term loan of RMB30 million ($4.7 million) bearing fixed interest at 7.84% per annum. As of September 30, 2015, we had unutilized committed banking facilities of $1.8 million. We plan to renew these loans upon maturity, and plan to raise additional funds through bank borrowings and equity financing in the future to meet our daily cash demands, if required. 

In the meanwhile, due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government is currently providing vigorous support to the new energy facilities and vehicles. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market, especially from the electric car market. We believe with that the booming market demand in high power lithium ion products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability.

Our Corporate History and Structure 

We conduct our current business through the following two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China that we own through BAK Asia:

&#149; Dalian BAK Trading, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on August 14, 2013, which focuses on the wholesale of lithium batteries and lithium batteries&#146; materials, import &#38; export business and related technology consulting service; and &#149; Dalian BAK Power, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on December 27, 2013, which focuses on the development and manufacture of high-power lithium batteries. Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:

Our Products 

The use of new materials have enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, energy storage and UPS. 

We believe high power lithium batteries represent the main direction of the development of new energy vehicle technologies according to the &#147;12th Five-Year Plan&#148; published by the Chinese government.

Our Dalian manufacturing facilities focus on the development and manufacture of high power lithium batteries, for use in the following end applications:

Battery Cell Type &#160; End applications* High-power lithium battery &#160; Electric bus [6,000-20,000] &#160; &#160; Electric car [1,500-3,5000] &#160; &#160; Hybrid electric vehicle [500-2000] &#160; &#160; Light electric vehicle [10-150] &#160; &#160; Cordless power tool [10-30] &#160; &#160; Uninterruptible power supply [30-300] &#160; &#160; Energy Storage [&#62;300 ] * Bracketed numbers denote number of cells per particular battery.

Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications 

End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other high power applications.

Electric Vehicles 

An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium battery&#146;s relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing.

Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or &#147;green&#148; technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells. 

The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China's new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. In 2015, the production and sales of new energy vehicles had explosive growth. According to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, from January to October 2015, the production of new energy vehicles reached 181,225 units - up 270 percent year-on-year; and sales reached 171,145 units - up 390 percent year-on-year. As the core mechanism for new energy vehicles, the power battery industry has also recently welcomed an unprecedented growth. According to the Development Program for the Energy Efficient and New Energy Vehicle Industry 2012-2020 designed by the State Council of the PRC, some major objectives are: to enthusiastically advance innovation in power battery technologies; scientifically plan the industrial layout; focus on developing power battery industry clusters; and actively promote the mass production of power batteries. With the recent introduction of a number of supporting policies, the production of power batteries for vehicles has grown remarkably.

Light Electric Vehicles 

Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles , with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. The electric bicycle market in China is huge. According to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (MIIT), in the first half of calendar year 2015, the sales of lithium battery-powered electric bicycles is about 12.3 million units. 

Energy Storage 

Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants.

Electric Tools 

Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black &#38; Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools. 

Uninterruptible Power Supplies 

A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium battery&#146;s relatively small size, light design and environmentally-friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing.

Revenue by Products 

Before June 30, 2014, we derived our revenues from BAK International and its subsidiaries which produced prismatic cells, cylindrical cells, lithium polymer cells and high-power lithium batteries. Since July 1, 2014, our revenue has been mainly from Dalian BAK Power for sale of batteries manufactured by BAK Tianjin under outsourcing arrangements. The following table sets forth the breakdown of our net revenues by each battery type during the last two fiscal years.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended September 30, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Net &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Net &#160; &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; Revenues &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; Revenues &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) &#160; Prismatic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Aluminum-case cells $ 24,486 &#160; &#160; 19.91% &#160; $ &#160;- &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; Battery packs &#160; 61,800 &#160; &#160; 50.24% &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; - &#160; Cylindrical cells &#160; 9,278 &#160; &#160; 7.54% &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; - &#160; Lithium polymer cells &#160; 17,146 &#160; &#160; 13.94% &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; - &#160; High-power lithium battery cells &#160; 10,304 &#160; &#160; 8.37% &#160; &#160; 13,904 &#160; &#160; 100.00% &#160; Total $ 123,014 &#160; &#160; 100.00% &#160; $ 13,904 &#160; &#160; 100.00% &#160; 4 

Sales and Marketing 

We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where China&#146;s main EV and LEV productions is located, such as Beijing, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province, Sichuan Province and three provinces in Northeast China. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products.

We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.

Suppliers 

The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators.
