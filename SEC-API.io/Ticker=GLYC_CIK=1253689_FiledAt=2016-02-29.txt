 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

Overview 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel glycomimetic drugs to address unmet medical needs resulting from diseases in which carbohydrate biology plays a key role. Glycomimetics are molecules that mimic the structure of carbohydrates involved in important biological processes. Using our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry and knowledge of carbohydrate biology, we are developing a pipeline of proprietary glycomimetics that may inhibit disease-related functions of carbohydrates, such as the roles they play in inflammation, cancer and infection. We believe this represents an innovative approach to drug discovery to treat a wide range of diseases. 

We are focusing our initial efforts on drug candidates for rare diseases that we believe will qualify for orphan drug designation. We are developing our lead drug candidate, rivipansel, for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOC, a debilitating and painful condition that occurs periodically throughout the life of a person with sickle cell disease. We have entered into a collaboration with Pfizer Inc. for the further development and potential commercialization of rivipansel worldwide. Rivipansel has received fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as well as orphan drug designation from the FDA in the United States and from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the European Union, or EU. We believe the clinical progress of rivipansel provides evidence of the significant potential of our lead program and our proprietary glycomimetics platform. Building on our experience with rivipansel, we are developing our second most advanced drug candidate, GMI-1271, to be used in combination with chemotherapy to treat either acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or multiple myeloma, or MM, both of which are life-threatening hematologic cancers, and potentially other hematologic cancers as well. 

Our proprietary glycomimetics platform is based on our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry and our understanding of the role carbohydrates play in key biological processes. Most human proteins are modified by the addition of complex carbohydrates to the surface of the proteins. The addition of these carbohydrate structures affects the functions of these proteins and their interactions with other molecules. Our initial research and development efforts have focused on drug candidates targeting selectins, which are proteins that serve as adhesion molecules and bind to carbohydrates that are involved in the inflammatory component and progression of a wide range of diseases, including hematologic disorders, cancer and cardiovascular disease. For example, we believe that members of the selectin family play a key role in the onset and progression of VOC and also in tumor metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibiting specific carbohydrates from binding to selectins has long been viewed as a potentially attractive approach for therapeutic intervention. The ability to successfully develop drug-like compounds that inhibit binding with selectins, known as selectin antagonists, has been limited by the complexities of carbohydrate chemistry. We believe our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry and our understanding of carbohydrate-protein binding interactions enable us to design selectin antagonists and other glycomimetics that may inhibit the disease-related functions of certain carbohydrates. We believe this expertise and knowledge may enable us to develop novel drug candidates to address unmet medical needs. 

Rivipansel, our lead drug candidate, is currently in development to treat VOC. Rivipansel is a glycomimetic drug candidate that acts as a pan-selectin antagonist, meaning it binds to all three members of the selectin family, E-, P- and L-selectin. We believe that rivipansel, by acting as a pan-selectin antagonist, inhibits the role that selectins play in VOC. 

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease that, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, affects millions of people throughout the world, including an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people in the United States. VOC is one of the most severe complications of sickle cell disease. It can result in acute ischemic tissue injury at one or more sites, with inflammation and pain of varying degrees of severity. The standard of care in the United States for people experiencing VOC is to manage its symptoms, which typically includes hospitalization, narcotic pain management and hydration. There are no approved therapies that interrupt VOC once it has started or that treat the underlying cause of the pain. Hydroxyurea is a generic drug that is approved for the prevention of VOC, but it is not effective in the acute setting to relieve symptoms or resolve an ongoing VOC episode. In addition, hydroxyurea is not suitable for all patients and can have significant toxicities and side effects. According to the CDC, there were approximately 73,000 hospitalizations related to VOC in the United States in 2010. We believe th at rivipansel, if approved, would be the first drug to interrupt the underlying cause of VOC, thereby potentially reducing the use of narcotics for pain management and enabling patients to leave the hospital more quickly. 

&#160;

We have completed four clinical trials of rivipansel involving a total of 163 subjects. In April 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in which 76 patients hospitalized for VOC, ranging from 12 to 60 years old, were treated with the standard of care plus either rivipansel or placebo. In this trial, patients treated with rivipansel experienced reductions in the time to reach resolution of VOC, length of hospital stay and use of opioid analgesics for pain management, in each case as compared to patients receiving placebo. This improvement was seen in both adult and pediatric patients. Adverse event rates and severity were comparable between those treated with rivipansel and those receiving placebo. 

We entered into a license agreement in October 2011 with Pfizer, under which Pfizer has rights to develop and commercialize rivipansel for all indications worldwide. Following the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trial, Pfizer is now responsible for the further clinical development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization of rivipansel. Under the Pfizer agreement, we received an upfront payment of $22.5 million from Pfizer. We are also eligible to receive payments of up to $115.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones, including the dosing of the first patients in Phase 3 clinical trials for up to two indications and the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the United States and selected European countries for up to two indications, up to $70.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including the acceptance of our filings for review by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe for up to two indications, and up to $135.0 million upon the achievement of specified levels of annual net sales of licensed products. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties, with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low teens, based on net sales of rivipansel worldwide, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. The first potential milestone payment under the Pfizer agreement was $35.0 million upon the initiation of dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 trial of rivipansel by Pfizer. Under the collaboration, Pfizer made a $15.0 million non-refundable payment to us in May 2014, and the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial triggered the remaining $20.0 million milestone payment to us, which we received in August 2015. 

Under a separate research agreement with the University of Basel, or the University, we have agreed to pay 10% of any future milestone payments and royalties we may receive from Pfizer with respect to rivipansel. As of December 31, 2015, we accrued $2.0 million that is payable to the University, which is equal to 10% of the $20.0 million non-refundable milestone payment we received from Pfizer in August 2015. The $1.5 million due upon receipt of the $15.0 million non-refundable payment received from Pfizer in May 2014 was accrued as of December 31, 2014 and subsequently paid in February 2015. 

We are developing a pipeline of other drug candidates based on our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry, including compounds that are designed to be specific to particular selectins. We are developing GMI-1271, a specific E-selectin inhibitor, to be used in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with AML, MM and potentially other hematologic cancers. 

AML is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The accumulation of cancer cells in the bone marrow potentially inhibits the production of mature blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. It is the most common form of acute leukemia among adults and accounts for the largest number of annual deaths from leukemias in the United States. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program managed by the National Cancer Institute, there were an estimated 20,830 new cases of AML diagnosed in 2015 in the United States. Approximately 300,000 patients in the world are diagnosed with AML annually. AML caused an estimated 10,460 deaths in 2015 in the United States. 

MM is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that affects a type of white blood cell that normally helps a person fight infections by making antibodies that recognize and attack germs. MM causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. MM is the most frequent tumor that occurs primarily in bone and the second most common hematologic cancer in the United States and Europe. MM accounts for 10% to 15% of hematologic cancers and 20% of deaths from these cancers. In the United States , an estimated &#160; 26,850 people were newly diagnosed in 2015. MM caused an estimated 11, 240 deaths in 2015 in the United States. In the European Union, in 2012, 39,000 new cases of MM were diagnosed and 24,000 deaths occurred . MM is most common in the elderly population, making aggressive treatment with chemotherapy more complicated for a patient population with additional medical concerns. 

E-selectin plays a critical role in binding cancer cells within vascular niches in the bone marrow, which prevents the cells from entering circulation where they can be more readily killed by chemotherapy. In separate animal studies, GMI-1271 mobilized AML and MM cancer cells out of the bone marrow, making them more sensitive to chemotherapy. 

&#160;

In both the AML and MM studies, tumor burden was significantly reduced in the animals treated with a combination of chemotherapy and GMI-1271 as compared to animals treated with chemotherapy alone. In addition, the combination of GMI-1271 with chemotherapy resulted in improved survival rates for the treated animals, compared to chemotherapy alone. In other animal studies, GMI-1271 appeared to also protect normal cells from some of the side effects of chemotherapy. Common side effects of chemotherapy include bone marrow toxicity resulting in neutropenia, which is an abnormally low number of neutrophils, the white blood cells that serve as the primary defense against infection, and mucositis, which is the inflammation and sloughing of the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract. Animals treated with GMI-1271 and chemotherapy had less severe neutropenia and mucositis and lower bone marrow toxicity as compared to animals treated with chemotherapy alone. We believe that treatment with GMI-1271 results in lower bone marrow toxicity due to its inhibition of E-selecti n, which inhibition makes stem cells in the bone marrow divide less frequently, thereby protecting them from chemotherapy agents that target rapidly dividing cells. 

We have completed an initial Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers. We have &#160; also initiated a multiple ascending do se-escalation clinical trial in defined populations of patients with AML , and we expect the Phase 1 portion of the trial to be complete d and the Phase 2 portion to be initiated in 2016. In December 2015 , at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology , or ASH , we presented first-in-human clinical data that suggested a favorable safety, pharmacokinetic , or PK, and biomarker profile for GMI-1271. Additionally, we presented preclinical data suggesting that GMI-1271 could reverse resistance of certain chemotherapies seen in MM. We plan to initiate a trial in patients with MM in the second half of 2016 . 

We have an additional drug candidate, GMI-1359, that simultaneously targets both E-selectin and a chemokine receptor known as CXCR4. GMI-1359 is currently undergoing testing in preclinical models from which we intend to select a target clinical indication, most likely in oncology. We received pre-IND guidance from the FDA in October 2015 and we plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for GMI-1359 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the third quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase 1 single-dose escalation trial in healthy volunteers in the fourth quarter of 2016. In December 2015 at the ASH annual meeting, we presented preclinical data suggesting that GMI-1359 enhanced the ability of chemotherapy to target and improve survival from a high-risk form of mutated AML. 

&#160; 

In addition to our programs described above, we are also advancing other preclinical-stage programs. These programs include small-molecule glycomimetic compounds that inhibit the proteins galectin-3 and galectin-9, which we believe may have potential to be used for the treatment of fibrosis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. 

We have retained the worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our drug candidates other than rivipansel. 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property portfolio includes ownership of, or exclusive rights to, issued patents and pending patent applications claiming fundamental features of glycomimetic therapeutics, as well as those claiming methods of use for and chemical modifications of our drug candidates. Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in this area. Our issued patents directed to rivipansel and methods of use are expected to expire between 2023 and 2030. We have a U.S. &#160; patent covering GMI-1271 which is expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we have several pending patent applications covering GMI-1271 and/or methods of using it, the last expiring of which, if issued, currently would be predicted to expire in 2034.

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be the leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel glycomimetic drugs to address unmet medical needs resulting from diseases in which carbohydrate biology plays a key role. Leveraging the potentially broad applicability of our proprietary glycomimetics platform, our initial focus is to internally develop and 

&#160;

advance orphan drug candidates targeted at hematologic cancers and other diseases, and to out-license any drug candidates we may develop that are targeted at larger market opportunities. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#183; 

Advance GMI-1271 for the treatment of A ML . We are building on our experience developing rivipansel to investigate GMI-1271 for the treatment of AML as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy. We have initiated a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation clinical trial in defined populations of patients with AML, and we expect the Phase 1 portion of the trial to be completed and the Phase 2 portion to be initiated in 2016. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights to GMI-1271. &#160; 

&#183; 

Advance GMI-1271 for the treatment of MM. We have initiated preparations for a Phase 1 multiple dose-escalation clinical trial in defined populations of patients with MM. We received a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, from the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland and plan to initiate the trial in the second half of 2016. 

&#183; 

Advance GMI-1359 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We have selected and intend to develop a drug candidate, GMI-1359, that simultaneously inhibits both E-selectin and CXCR4 for use in the treatment of cancers with significant bone marrow involvement, such as AML and MM . &#160; We received pre-IND guidance from the FDA in October 2015 and we plan to submit an IND for GMI-1359 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the third quarter of 2016. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights to GMI-1359. 

&#183; 

Support Pfizer&#8217;s further development of rivipansel . We will continue to support Pfizer, if requested, as Pfizer proceeds with further clinical development of rivipansel, including the Phase 3 clinical trial, and pursues regulatory approval of rivipansel. We expect to use any milestone and royalty payments that we may receive from Pfizer to accelerate the development of our other drug candidates. 

&#183; 

Identify and develop additional novel selectin antagonists to address unmet medical needs with significant market potential . We believe our glycomimetics platform will enable us to develop a broad pipeline of potential drug candidates that may be orphan drugs or may address larger market opportunities. We are also working to design additional E-selectin antagonist s that could be delivered subcutaneously or orally , which we believe could be of significant interest to potential collaborators for major market opportunities, such as the treatment of cardiovascular disease. &#160; 

&#183; 

Apply our insights and our glycomimetics platform to other carbohydrate targets beyond selectins . We have identified additional opportunities where carbohydrates play critical roles in disease processes and where we believe we can apply our platform to create targeted glycomimetic drugs. We have begun to design and synthesize antagonists of a protein family known as galectins. We believe that compounds targeting galectins might potentially be used to treat certain forms of cancer and fibrosis. 

Our Platform 

Our proprietary glycomimetics platform is based on our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry and our understanding of the role carbohydrates play in key biological processes. Carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces are responsible for complex carbohydrate-protein binding interactions. Inhibiting these binding interactions affects the functions of these proteins and their interactions with other molecules. We believe our expertise enables us to design specific glycomimetic molecules that can mimic carbohydrate structures and thereby inhibit their disease-related functions. 

Our initial focus is on selectin antagonists, which we believe have the potential to address unmet medical needs in a number of orphan and large market opportunities. Selectins have been shown to play a key role in a wide range of diseases, including hematologic disorders, cancer and cardiovascular disease. 

Our initial drug design efforts are focused on a naturally occurring, three-dimensional complex carbohydrate core structure known as the Lewis structure. This core structure is naturally modified in a variety of ways to form many different functional carbohydrates. These variations determine the biological functions of the carbohydrates, including functions related to conditions such as inflammatory diseases, cancer and infection. Accordingly, we believe that this structure provides the foundation for the design of glycomimetic drug candidates that could be used to address a variety of diseases. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Once we identify a carbohydrate structure involved in a disease pathway, we design molecules that mimic that carbohydrate structure and inhibit its disease-related functions by binding to the carbohydrate&#8217;s target receptor, thereby blocking the binding by the native carbohydrate itself. For example, one of the naturally modified Lewis structures binds to selectins, which play a key role in VOC. Rivipansel mimics that carbohydrate structure and accordingly binds to selectins, which we believe thereby inhibits the progression of VOC. In addition, our glycomimetic molecules are designed to have greater affinity to the carbohydrate&#8217;s target receptor than does the native carbohydrate. This means that the glycomimetic molecules possess stronger intermolecular forces between themselves and the target receptors, and thus &#8220;outcompete&#8221; the native carbohydrates in binding to the relevant target receptors, thereby inhibiting their disease-related functions. Using our glycomimetics platform, we have designed and synthesized a proprietary library of these structures targeting different biological processes. 

Our glycomimetics platform includes intellectual property, know-how, expertise, proprietary biological information and biochemical assays, all of which support the rational design of potent glycomimetic compounds. These include: 

&#183; 

Know-how to successfully mimic the Lewis structure, which is common to a number of functional carbohydrates. 

&#183; 

Use of empirical methods to determine critical interactions between variations of a particular functional carbohydrate and its target molecule. 

&#183; 

Application of the empirically determined bioactive structure of the functional carbohydrate for docking into the binding area of the crystal structure of the target molecule. 

&#183; 

Expertise in stabilizing the bioactive core of glycomimetic compounds and increasing the number of interaction contact points to improve affinity. 

&#183; 

Experience and technology in synthetic organic chemistry required for the specialized synthesis of carbohydrates and their modifications. 

&#183; 

Proprietary assays to determine the binding characteristics, inhibitory activity and biological activity of glycomimetic compounds. 

&#160;

Our Pipeline 

We have discovered our drug candidates internally through a rational drug design approach that couples our expertise in carbohydrate chemistry with our knowledge of carbohydrate biology. We are actively developing glycomimetic drug candidates based on this expertise. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Rivipansel &#8212;Targeting Selectins to Treat VOC 

We are developing rivipansel to treat VOC with the goal of reducing duration of VOC episodes, length of hospital stay and use of opioid analgesics for pain management. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, patients treated with rivipansel plus the standard of care demonstrated improvement in these endpoints, in each case as compared to patients receiving placebo plus the standard of care. 

Sickle Cell Disease and VOC 

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disease that, according to the CDC, affects millions of people throughout the world, including an estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people in the United States. One of the most severe complications of sickle cell disease is VOC. VOC episodes are typically characterized by excruciating musculoskeletal pain, visceral pain and pain in other locations, and occur periodically throughout the life of a person with sickle cell disease. The CDC estimates that VOC resulted in approximately 73,000 hospitalizations in the United States in 2010. According to the National Hospital Discharge Survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, these hospitalizations have an average duration of approximately six days. The standard of care in the United States for people experiencing VOC is to manage its symptoms, which typically includes hospitalization, narcotic pain management and hydration. There are no approved therapies that interrupt VOC once it has started or that treat the underlying cause of the pain. 

&#160;

Among both adults and children with sickle cell disease, VOC is the most common reason for seeking medical attention resulting in hospitalization. VOC affects multiple organ systems, and may result in significant clinical complications. Most sickle cell disease-related deaths occur during acute VOC, and are due to infection, acute chest syndrome, stroke or multi-organ failure. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity for Treatment of VOC 

We believe that effective treatment of VOC could provide significant clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefit. According to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the average hospital charges in the United States for a patient treated for VOC were approximately $20,000 in 2006. In some states, these charges may be substantially higher. For example, according to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the average hospital charges for a patient treated for VOC in California were over $40,000 in 2006. A reduction in the length of a hospital stay could reduce these costs. If rivipansel is shown to be safe and effective in reducing the duration of VOC in hospitalized patients, it could also be tested to determine if hospitalization could be prevented with use of rivipansel in the emergency department, or if VOC could be managed safely and effectively in the home or in an outpatient setting through a self-administered dosage form, thereby avoiding costly emergency department visits. We believe that uses in each of these settings represent potentially significant market opportunities. 

The Role of Selectins in VOC 

The cause of vascular occlusion involves both an inflammatory component and a mechanical component. In the inflammatory component, white blood cells begin to roll along and then adhere to the endothelium, the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels. These white blood cells then become activated and express adhesion receptors known as integrins, which bind and form aggregates with platelets, red blood cells and other white blood cells. These cell aggregates are responsible for the mechanical component of vascular occlusion, in which rigid sickled red blood cells are more easily caught in the post-capillary venules, which are very small blood vessels connecting the capillaries and the veins. The resulting vascular occlusion causes slowing of blood flow in the post-capillary venules, contributing to inadequate oxygen supply in the local tissue, known as ischemia, which in turn causes further tissue inflammation and pain. 

The development of VOC is illustrated in the following diagram: 

&#160; 

Selectins are important in this process because they act as adhesion molecules and play a key role in the initial recognition and binding of white blood cells to the endothelial cells, and their formation of aggregates with platelets, red blood cells and other white blood cells. White blood cells express carbohydrates on their surfaces that bind to E-selectin that is present on inflamed vascular endothelium. White blood cells bound to E-selectin on the endothelial cells then become activated and act as adhesion sites for platelets, red blood cells and other white blood cells, thereby leading to the formation of an occlusion. Rivipansel is a glycomimetic drug candidate designed to inhibit binding of all three types of selectins and inhibit the selectin-mediated recognition and binding of white blood cells to the endothelium. The rationale for the development of rivipansel to treat VOC is that, by blocking these steps in the vaso-occlusive process, it has the potential to decrease the duration and intensity of VOC. 

&#160;

Limitations of the Current Standard of Care for VOC 

The current standard of care for VOC is focused on managing its symptoms. Narcotics are typically used for the management of acute pain associated with VOC. Pain management often starts with oral medications taken at home at the onset of pain. However, if the pain is not relieved, or if it progresses, patients may seek medical attention in a clinic setting or emergency department. Pain that is not controlled in these settings may require hospitalization for more potent pain medications, typically administered intravenously. The patient must stay in the hospital to receive these intravenous, or IV, pain medications until the VOC resolves and the pain subsides. Other supportive measures during hospitalization include hydration, supplemental oxygen and treatment of any concurrent infections or other conditions. While pain medications can be effective in managing pain during VOC, they do not affect or resolve the underlying vascular occlusion, tissue ischemia or potential organ damage. 

The only approved drug targeting VOC is hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. Hydroxyurea has been approved as a once-daily oral treatment for reducing the frequency of VOC and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with recurrent moderate-to-severe VOC. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of VOC in some patient groups, it is not effective in relieving symptoms or accelerating the resolution of an ongoing VOC episode. Moreover, hydroxyurea is not suitable for all patients and can have significant toxicities and side effects. In particular, hydroxyurea is labeled to inform patients that it can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in a patient&#8217;s bone marrow, which may increase risks that the patient will develop a serious infection or bleeding, and that it may increase the risk that the patient will develop certain cancers. Additionally, since hydroxyurea is prescribed to be taken on a daily basis, lack of patient compliance can be a barrier to its optimal use. 

Since available therapies do not interrupt the VOC episode, opioid narcotics are generally prescribed to treat the pain until the VOC runs its natural course. Use of narcotics can lead to tissue or organ damage and resulting complications and morbidities, prolonged hospital stays and associated continuation of pain and suffering. Treatment of pain with IV narcotics and management of VOC-related complications typically require hospital stays ranging from a few days to a few weeks, with an average length of stay of approximately six days. 

Rivipansel Clinical Results 

We held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in June 2007 and submitted an IND for rivipansel in July 2008. Upon approval of the IND, we initiated a single dose Phase 1a trial of rivipansel in August 2008. In December 2008, we completed the Phase 1a trial, in which 40 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Of these subjects, 30 were dosed once with one of five dose levels of rivipansel, ranging from 2 to 40 mg/kg, and 10 received placebo. In addition, we completed a multiple dose Phase 1b trial in February 2009, in which 32 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Of these subjects, 24 were dosed with four dose levels of rivipansel, and eight received placebo. Three groups of six subjects each were dosed at 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg every eight hours for 13 doses. An additional group of six subjects received a loading dose of 40 mg/kg, followed by 20 mg/kg every eight hours for six doses. The results of these trials demonstrated a half-life of rivipansel of approximately seven hours, with the drug excreted largely intact. Rivipansel was well tolerated in these subjects and no safety concerns were identified. Adverse events occurred at similar rates across the treatment groups in both of these trials. 

In 2010, we completed a Phase 1 pilot trial in 15 adults with sickle cell disease not experiencing VOC. In this trial, patients received a loading dose of 20 mg/kg of rivipansel, followed by a dose of 10 mg/kg ten hours later. The trial focused on the evaluation of safety, PK profiles and certain biomarkers. In individuals with sickle cell disease and at the dose levels intended for further evaluation, no safety concerns associated with the use of rivipansel were identified and the PK profile was also similar to that seen in healthy volunteers. When administered to patients with sickle cell disease, rivipansel was shown to affect biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. The results of this trial were selected for oral presentations at the ASH annual meetings in December 2011 and 2012. 

Results from these three Phase 1 clinical trials demonstrated evidence of linear PK for rivipansel when administered as single or multiple doses to the 72 healthy volunteers and the 15 patients with sickle cell disease. Rivipansel was well tolerated in these subjects and no safety concerns were identified. Adverse events occurred at similar rates across the treatment groups in these trials. 

&#160;

We also completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of rivipansel in sickle cell patients hospitalized for VOC. We announced top-line results from this trial in April 2013, and the results of this trial were selected for two oral presentations and one poster session at the annual meeting of ASH in December 2013. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 22 sites in the United States and Canada evaluating the safety, efficacy and PK of multiple IV doses of rivipansel or placebo in 76 patients hospitalized for VOC, ranging from 12 to 60 years old. Of these patients, 43 received rivipansel and 33 received placebo, in both cases in addition to the standard of care. Patients receiving rivipansel in the trial received one of two dose levels. Patients in the low dose group received a loading dose of 20 mg/kg, followed by a 10 mg/kg dose every 12 hours. Patients in the high dose group received a loading dose of 40 mg/kg, followed by a 20 mg/kg dose every 12 hours. 

In patients receiving rivipansel in this trial, there were reductions in multiple measures related to a VOC episode as compared to patients receiving placebo. Two widely used statistical methods, known as ANCOVA and Kaplan-Meier, were used to analyze the results of this trial. The time to reach resolution of VOC, the primary endpoint of the trial, was reduced in the patients receiving rivipansel by a mean of 41.0 hours, as measured by ANCOVA, with a p-value of 0.192, and reduced by a median of 63.3 hours, as measured by Kaplan-Meier, with a p-value of 0.187. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. In addition, in the patients receiving rivipansel, the time to hospital discharge was reduced by a mean of 54.7 hours, as measured by ANCOVA, with a p-value of 0.096, and a median of 83.9 hours, as measured by Kaplan-Meier, with a p-value of 0.092. The time to transition off IV analgesics was reduced by a mean of 47.0 hours, as measured by ANCOVA, with a p-value of 0.137, and a median of 75.7 hours, with a p-value of 0.089, as measured by Kaplan-Meier. The cumulative amount of opioid analgesic administered during hospitalization was reduced by 83%, as measured by ANCOVA, with a p- value of 0.01. Although the Phase 2 clinical trial was not large enough to detect statistically significant differences in these endpoints, other than with respect to the reduction in cumulative amount of opioid analgesic administered, we believe the observed reductions in these measures in patients treated with rivipansel, and the consistency of a positive response across multiple measures, demonstrate the potential benefit of rivipansel. 

The types and frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events were comparable across the treatment groups in the Phase 2 clinical trial. The most common serious adverse event was rehospitalization for VOC. Measures of organ function, respiratory and cardiac function and routine tests of medical status while in the hospital were similar between the groups. One serious rash occurred in the high dose group, which resolved with minimal medical treatment. Acute chest syndrome, a complication of sickle cell disease affecting the lungs, occurred in six subjects receiving rivipansel and in three subjects receiving placebo. Rehospitalization rates for VOC were similar between the groups and lower than the rehospitalization rate that is typical for VOC. 

We believe the favorable effects we observed in our Phase 2 clinical trial are the result of mechanism-based resolution of VOC. Specifically, we believe that by inhibiting selectin-mediated adhesion of white blood cells to the endothelium, rivipansel prevents propagation of VOC and promotes early resolution. Results from the Phase 2 clinical trial provide the first clinical evidence of a positive effect of rivipansel in adult and pediatric patients experiencing VOC. No currently available therapies provide similar benefits to patients in VOC. Based on the data from our Phase 2 clinical trial for rivipansel, we believe rivipansel has the potential to become the first drug approved to treat VOC in both adult and pediatric patient populations. 

If rivipansel is demonstrated to be safe and effective for the treatment of VOC, we believe it may show substantial clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefit. If patients treated with rivipansel are discharged more quickly from the hospital, there is potential to reduce the costs of hospitalization, in addition to showing clinical benefit by reduced duration of VOC episodes and reduced use of opioid analgesics for pain management. In addition, if rivipansel is shown to be safe and effective for treating VOC in hospitalized patients, it is possible that it could be tested in patients experiencing VOC who are not hospitalized to determine if hospitalization could be prevented or if pain from VOC could be managed safely and effectively in the home or in an outpatient setting. We believe that uses in each of these settings could represent significant market opportunities for rivipansel. Following the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, Pfizer is now responsible for the further clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of rivipansel. 

Following transfer of the IND, Pfizer has undertaken significant activity to work toward a New Drug Application, or NDA, for rivipansel including, an approved special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement for the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of the Phase 3 clinical trial. Pfizer enrolled the first patient in this Phase 3 clinical trial 

&#160;

in June 2015. The Phase 3 trial, entitled &#8220;RESET&#8221; ( R ivipansel: E valuating S afety, E fficacy and T ime to Discharge), is assessing the efficacy and safety of rivipansel for the treatment of VOC in patients hospitalized with sickle cell disease. Pfizer intends to enroll at least 350 subjects with sickle cell disease, aged six and older who are hospitalized for VOC, in this Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with rivipansel. Trial participants must be receiving treatment with intravenous, or IV, opioids for their VOC and must be able to receive the first dose of rivipansel within 24 hours of initiation of intravenous opioid therapy. The primary endpoint for the trial will be time to readiness-for-discharge. Key secondary endpoints will include time to discharge, cumulative IV opioid consumption and time to discontinuation of IV opioids. 

GMI-1271&#8212;Targeting the Bone Marrow Microenvironment to Treat Hematologic Cancers 

We are developing GMI-1271, a specific E-selectin antagonist, to be used adjunctively with standard chemotherapy to treat AML, MM and other hematologic cancers. We believe that GMI-1271 may be used as first-line treatment for elderly AML or MM patients, for patients with relapsed or refractory AML, as well as for patients with relapsed or refractory MM. GMI-1271 targets interactions between cancer cells and the bone marrow microenvironment. In preclinical studies, combining GMI-1271 with chemotherapy made cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. In other preclinical studies, GMI-1271 also reduced some of the toxic effects of chemotherapy, including neutropenia and mucositis, on normal cells. 

Acute Myeloid Leukemia 

AML, a hematologic cancer that is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells, is a relatively rare disease, but one that accounts for the largest number of annual deaths from leukemia in the United States. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program managed by the National Cancer Institute, there were an estimated 20,830 new cases of AML diagnosed in 2015 in the United States . &#160; Approximately 300,000 patients in the world are diagnosed with AML annually. AML caused an estimated 10,460 deaths in 2015 in the United States. 

AML is more commonly present in elderly patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 67 years according to the National Cancer Institute. In a review published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , the median overall survival of patients 60 years old or older was 8.7 months. The overall five-year relative survival rate for all AML patients is 24%, and only 5% for patients over 65 years old at diagnosis. Relative survival is a statistical measure of net survival that is calculated by comparing observed survival with expected survival from a comparable set of people who do not have AML, in order to measure the excess mortality that is associated with the AML diagnosis. 

A number of published studies indicate that only some AML patients who receive chemotherapy achieve a complete response, which is defined as the disappearance of all signs of AML, and that most of those with a complete response will eventually relapse. Patients who do not enter remission are referred to as refractory, meaning that they are resistant to the chemotherapy treatment. 

We believe there is a need for new treatment options for elderly AML patients, as well as those AML patients who relapse or develop refractory disease. Most AML patients with relapsed or refractory disease have no established treatment options and, accordingly, may be referred for participation in clinical studies of potential new therapies. For patients who elect not to participate or are unable to participate, treatment options typically include chemotherapy regimens, hypomethylating agents and supportive care. Further, many elderly AML patients are too frail to undergo chemotherapy as a result of other medical conditions, and may only be able to tolerate pain comfort or control measures. Without treatment, however, AML is uniformly fatal. 

&#160; 

Multiple Myeloma 

MM is a hematologic cancer that is characterized by the growth of abnormal white blood cells of the bone marrow that eventually infiltrates various organs and leads to bone destruction, bone marrow failure, including direct and indirect effects on the blood, skeleton, and kidneys. MM is the most frequent tumor that occurs primarily in bone and the second most common hematological malignancy in the United States and Europe. MM accounts for 10% to 15% of hematologic cancers, and 20% of deaths from these cancers. Approximately 114,000 new cases of MM were diagnosed 

&#160;

worldwide in 201 2 . In the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, an estimated &#160; 26,850 people were newly diagnosed with MM in 2015. MM caused an estimated 11, 240 deaths in 2015 in the United States. MM is rare in individuals younger than 40 years old and the median age at diagnosis is approximately &#160; 70 years. More than 3 5% of patients are over 70 years of age, making treatment with chemotherapy more complicated due to fewer treatment options being available, patients being ineligible for transplant, and decreased ability to tolerate sustained chemotherapy due to poor general health. 

Despite the fact that recent treatment options for MM have led to improved response rates and increased short-term survival, responses are transient and most patients with MM will ultimately relapse and succumb to their cancer. MM is not considered curable with current approaches. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients in the United States is 47 %. Although second and later remissions can be achieved with additional treatment, tumors typically recur more aggressively after each relapse, leading to decreased duration of response and ultimately culminating in the development of treatment-refractory disease. Median survival for treatment-refractory disease typically ranges from five months for event-free survival and to nine months for overall survival and responses to treatment are characteristically short, most likely due to resistant disease. This loss of response complicates therapy of patients in later-line treatment, shortens survival and results in high mortality rates. 

&#160; 

Role of E-selectin in AML and MM 

E-selectin has been shown to play important roles in the progression of AML and MM. This has been observed in several studies, which have shown that levels of E-selectin correlate with tumor infiltration and relapse in AML and survival rates for both diseases . We therefore believe that our E-selectin antagonist, GMI-1271, has the potential to improve the current treatment of patients with AML or MM. 

GMI-1271 Preclinical Development 

Some leukemia cells, known as blast cells, bind to E-selectin in the bone marrow where they are relatively protected from the effects of chemotherapy. This phenomenon is known as cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance, or CAMDR. We believe that E-selectin inhibition disrupts the adhesion involved in CAMDR and mobilizes blast cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream, making them more susceptible to chemotherapy. We believe that this mechanism of action may allow GMI-1271 to improve chemotherapy response rates, duration of remission and, ultimately, survival in patients with hematologic cancers such as AML. 

In one in vivo study in a mouse model of AML, combining GMI-1271 with chemotherapy mobilized AML blast cells and significantly reduced tumor burden as compared to treatment with chemotherapy alone. In an in vitro study, AML cells bound to E-selectin were more resistant to chemotherapy. In a related study, when treated with GMI-1271, the resistance of such cells to chemotherapy was reduced. Tumor cells of patients who have relapsed AML, when tested in the laboratory, bound significantly higher levels of E-selectin than tumor cells of patients at initial diagnosis. In another in vitro study, GMI-1271 inhibited the E-selectin-mediated activation of the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways, which are known to play important roles in the development and progression of AML. These pathways are activated in tumors when they are bound to E-selectin, and activation of these pathways may enhance the survival of these tumor cells. We believe that all of this data supports our strategy for targeting E-selectin in these patients. GMI-1271 represents a novel agent that we believe could potentially be combined with many chemotherapeutic agents. 

&#160; 

As GMI-1271 disrupts the interactions between cancer cells and bone marrow microenvironment, its mechanism of action is not limited to a single tumor type. In addition to our studies in AML, we have also tested the drug candidate in other cancer models. In three xenograft mouse models of MM, GMI-1271 was evaluated in combination with the proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib or carfilzomib. Treatment of mice with GMI-1271 plus bortezomib or GMI-1271 plus carfilzomib significantly improved survival when compared to chemotherapy alone. In addition, treatment with GMI-1271 resulted in mobilization of MM cells in the peripheral blood past the point of elimination of the drug from plasma and bone marrow, thereby making them more susceptible to chemotherapy. These data provide evidence that GMI-1271 is a potential treatment option to enhance response to chemotherapy in MM. Moreover, in in vivo studies involving animal models of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, GMI-1271, as an adjunct to standard-of-care chemotherapy, decreased tumor burden and improved survival over standard-of-care chemotherapy alone. 

&#160;

In addition to its anti-tumor effects, GMI-1271, in animal models, has shown protection against some of the toxicities of chemotherapy. In particular, animals treated with GMI-1271 in combination with chemotherapy had less severe neutropenia and mucositis and lower bone marrow toxicity as compared to animals treated with chemotherapy alone. We believe that treatment with GMI-1271 results in lower bone marrow toxicity due to its inhibition of E-selectin, thereby making hematopoietic stem cells divide less frequently and protecting them from chemotherapy agents that target rapidly dividing cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are blood cells that give rise to all other types of blood cells and are heavily concentrated in the bone marrow. Similar effects have been demonstrated with rivipansel and were published in the journal Nature Medicine in December 2012. Based on these reductions in some of the toxicities of chemotherapy, we are evaluating these effects as secondary efficacy endpoints in our clinical trials. 

GMI-1271 Clinical Trials 

In August 2014, we completed a Phase 1 trial of GMI-1271 in healthy volunteers. The single-site Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending intravenous dose trial. In the trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GMI-1271. Twenty-eight healthy adult subjects were enrolled in cohorts to receive study drug at three dose levels. &#160; In the trial, we observed that the subjects tolerated GMI-1271 well, and that the pharmacokinetics for GMI-1271 were as predicted based on preclinical data. 

Following the completion of the Phase 1 trial, w e have initiated a multinational, Phase 1/2, open-label trial of GMI-1271 as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy in patients with AML. This trial in males and females with AML is being conducted at a number of academic institutions in the United States, Ireland and Australia. The trial consists of two parts. In the Phase 1 portion, escalation testing will be performed to determine a recommended GMI-1271 dose in combinat ion with standard chemotherapy. We plan to evaluate up to four different doses, with six patients in e ach dose cohort. In the Phase 2 portion, dose-expansion testing will be conducted &#160; to obtain additional safety and efficacy data in defined sub-populations of AML. We expect to complete the Phase 1 portion and initiate the Phase 2 portion in 2016. This will be followed by an expansion in specific patient populations. 

We have initiated preparations for a Phase 1 multiple dose-escalation clinical trial in defined populations of patients with MM. In this trial we plan to evaluate GMI-1271 as an adjunct to borte z omib, another therapy approved to treat MM. We have received a CTA from the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland and plan to initiate the trial in the second half of 2016. 

Other Indications 

In December 2013, researchers at the University of Michigan received a grant from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to evaluate GMI-1271 as a potential treatment for venous thromboembolic disease, or VTE, a serious blood clotting disorder. VTE, which can occur after a major operation or severe illness, such as a heart attack, stroke or some cancers, refers to both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, which is the formation of blood clots in large veins, primarily in the legs. The clots become dangerous when they break loose and can affect blood flow to the heart and lungs. Because GMI-1271, as an E-selectin antagonist, also inhibits the activation of processes leading to thrombosis, we believe that it has therapeutic potential to decrease thrombosis and its inflammatory effects. 

The University of Michigan began dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 randomized, partially blinded, active placebo-controlled trial in December 2014. The primary objective of the trial &#160; was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of GMI-1271 in a single ascending dose in healthy volunteers. The secondary objectives include d evaluation of the incidence of bleeding and other adverse events and evaluation of the effects of GMI-1271 on biomarkers of coagulation, cell adhesion and leukocyte and platelet activation. The single ascending dose-escalation clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers was completed in October 2015 and the trial has been extended to include a multiple ascending dose-escalation in eight healthy volunteers. We expect that results from this trial will be available in the third quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with DVT in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

GMI-1359 - Drug Candidate Targeting E-selectin and CXCR4 

The chemokine CXCR4 has emerged as an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in cell migration throughout the body. Like E-selectin, tumor cells may also use the CXCR4 cellular pathway, contributing to chemoresistance, metastatic disease and ultimately decreased survival. 

&#160; 

We have designed a family of small molecule drug candidates that simultaneously inhibit both E-selectin and CXCR4. We have selected one of these compounds, GMI-1359, to be developed further as part of an IND-enabling nonclinical program. Since E-selectin and CXCR4 are both adhesion molecules that keep cancer cells in the bone marrow, we believe that targeting both E-selectin and CXCR4 with a single compound could improve efficacy in the treatment of cancers that affect the bone marrow such as AML and MM , as compared to targeting CXCR4 alone. At the ASH annual meeting in December 2015, we presented preclinical data suggesting th at GMI-1359 enhanced the ability of chemotherapy to target and improve survival from a high-risk form of mutated AML. We are currently preparing GMI-1359 for clinical development and anticipate filing an IND in the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Galectin Inhibitors 

&#160; 

Galectin-3 and galectin-9 are proteins that are known to play critical roles in many pathological processes, including checkpoints (LAG-3 and TIM-3) in T-cell exhaustion during cancer immunotherapy, chemotherapy resistance, fibrosis and cardiovascular disease. Using our glycomimetics platform, we have designed galectin-3 and galectin-9 inhibitors that specifically block the binding the binding of galectin-3 and galectin-9 to carbohydrate structures. We plan to optimize these compounds and conduct preclinical experiments in 2016 to further characterize the effects of galectin-3 and galectin-9 inhibitors on immune processes and anti-fibrotic activity. 

Our Collaboration with Pfizer 

Overview 

In October 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer, under which we granted Pfizer an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize rivipansel, for all fields and uses. The products licensed under the agreement also include certain backup compounds, along with modifications of and improvements to rivipansel that meet defined chemical properties. 

Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $22.5 million upfront payment and are eligible to earn up to $115.0 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones, including the dosing of the first patients in Phase 3 clinical trials for up to two indications and the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the United States and selected European countries for up to two indications, up to $70.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, including the acceptance of our filings for regulatory approval by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe for up to two indications, and up to $135.0 million upon the achievement of specified levels of annual net sales of licensed products. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties for each licensed product, with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low teens, based on net sales of rivipansel worldwide, subject to reductions in specified circumstances. The first potential milestone payment under the Pfizer agreement was $35.0 million upon the initiation of dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 trial of rivipansel by Pfizer. Under the collaboration, Pfizer made a $15.0 million non-refundable payment to us in May 2014, and the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial triggered the remaining $20.0 million milestone payment to us, which we received in August 2015. 

Development and Commercialization Obligations 

Pfizer will initially develop and seek approval for rivipansel in the field of sickle cell disease under the agreement. We were responsible for completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial relating to VOC associated with sickle cell disease. Following the completion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, we now have no further development or commercialization obligations, and Pfizer is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize rivipansel for sickle cell disease in the United States. Pfizer generally must notify us in writing promptly of any decision to cease development activities, efforts to obtain regulatory approval or commercialization of rivipansel for the first approved indication. 

&#160;

Governance 

The agreement establishes a non-voting, joint steering committee to facilitate the exchange of information regarding the development of licensed products and the initial commercialization plans for such products. 

Exclusivity Restrictions 

During the term of the agreement, we may not directly or indirectly commercialize any pharmaceutical compound or product that is labeled for the treatment, prevention or prophylaxis of a vaso-occlusive or painful crisis associated with sickle cell disease anywhere in the world, subject to specified exceptions if we or our affiliates were to undergo a change of control. 

Term and Termination 

The agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the date of termination of the applicable royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country and in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with the first commercial sale in the applicable country and ending on the expiration of specified patent coverage or 10 years following the first commercial sale in the applicable country, whichever is later. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement, subject to certain notice requirements. The agreement may also be terminated in its entirety either by Pfizer or by us in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. 

Effects of Termination 

Upon termination of the agreement by Pfizer for convenience or by us, all rights and licenses granted to Pfizer under the agreement will terminate and Pfizer is obligated to grant us a non-exclusive worldwide license to specified Pfizer proprietary rights to develop and commercialize licensed products in the form being used or sold by Pfizer at the time of such termination, to transfer to us specified data and regulatory materials and approvals, and to provide for the continued supply of licensed products subject to specified terms. If Pfizer has completed additional clinical trials for the applicable licensed product and we obtain such a license or obtain such data and materials and commercialize a licensed product, then, for a period of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product, Pfizer is eligible to receive royalties at defined percentages in the low single-digits on net sales of such licensed product worldwide, up to a defined aggregate payment cap. The applicable royalty rate and maximum royalty payment cap depend on the stage of clinical development at the time of such termination. 

Research Services Agreement with University of Basel 

We have a research services agreement with the University, under which University personnel have performed research services for us on an as-requested basis since 2004 pursuant to separately negotiated research plan work orders, each lasting one year. We have no obligation to continue to purchase services from the University under the agreement. Under the current research plan, the University is performing research services related to potential oral selectin antagonists and PK evaluation for new selectin antagonists in development by us. We have agreed to pay the University consideration for the research services performed, as determined in connection with each annual research plan work order. For each of the annual research terms ended in February 2014 and 2015, we paid the University approximately $200,000. 

We do not license any intellectual property from the University under this agreement as the University assigns to us its rights in any intellectual property jointly developed under this agreement. However, as part of the original consideration for entering into the agreement, we granted to the University the right to receive payments from us under specified circumstances. Accordingly, if we receive any future milestone payments or royalties from Pfizer with respect to rivipansel, we have agreed to pay 10% of those amounts to the University, subject to specified exceptions. These potential payments to the University are our only affirmative obligation under the agreement other than payment for research services for ongoing research plan work orders. As of December 31, 2015, we accrued $2.0 million that is payable to the University, which is equal to 10% of the $20.0 million non-refundable milestone payment we received from Pfizer in August 2015. The $1.5 million due upon receipt of the $15.0 million non-refundable payment received from Pfizer in May 2014 was accrued as of December 31, 2014 and subsequently paid in February 2015. 

&#160;

The agreement remains in effect until we are no longer obligated to make any potential payments. The agreement contemplates individual one year research terms, which have been implemented by annual amendments to the agreement effective as of February of each year. The agreement may be terminated by us if the investigator performing the services under the agreement becomes incapacitated to properly carry out his duties under the agreement. The agreement may also be terminated by either party upon material breach by the other party unless the breaching party cures the breach within 90 days. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We strive to protect the intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates and their methods of use. We have issued patents directed to rivipansel and methods of use that are expected to expire between 2023 and 2030. We also have an issued patent which covers GMI-1271 which currently will expire in 2032. In addition, we have several pending patent applications covering GMI-1271 and/or methods of using it, the last expiring of which, if issued, currently would be predicted to expire in 2034. 

We have patent applications directed to GMI-1271 that, if issued, are expected to expire between 2032 and 2033. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of glycomimetics. 

A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our drug candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our drug candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. If we are not able to obtain such a license, or are not able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be materially harmed. 

We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to additional glycomimetic compounds and their derivatives, compositions and formulations containing them and methods of using them. Additionally, we will seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds and their use in a variety of therapies. 

The patent positions of biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance, including where a reissue application is filed in relation to an issued patent to correct issues or errors arising during prosecution that may render claims of the issued patent either wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our drug candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 

Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our drug candidates receive marketing approval. 

In the case of rivipansel, the initial process development, manufacturing and scale-up was managed by us and performed under contract by third parties. Under our license agreement with Pfizer, responsibility for manufacturing rivipansel has now transferred to Pfizer. With respect to our other drug candidates, we anticipate continuing to manage process development, scale-up and manufacturing under contracts with third parties. 

All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 

Commercialization 

We have not yet established a sales, marketing or drug distribution infrastructure. With the exception of rivipansel, to which we have granted Pfizer exclusive commercialization rights, we generally expect to retain commercial rights in the United States for our current drug candidates, all of which are still in preclinical or early clinical development. We believe that it will be possible for us to access the U.S. market for those drug candidates through a focused, specialized sales force. 

Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our drugs. We believe that such an organization will be able to target the community of physicians who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our drug candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our drug candidates that obtain marketing approval. 

We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any drugs that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved drugs and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

&#160; 

Rivipansel: Sickle Cell Anemia 

&#160; 

The only approved drug for sickle cell anemia is hydroxyurea, an antineoplastic agent that was initially approved for the treatment of cancer. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of painful crises and blood transfusions in adults with sickle cell anemia, it is not effective in relieving symptoms or accelerating the resolution of an ongoing VOC episode. Moreover, since it is a cytotoxic and myelosuppressive agent, hydroxyurea is not suitable for all patients and can have significant toxicities and side effects that warrant close monitoring and supervision. There are no drugs currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell anemia patients experiencing an acute VOC episode. While 

&#160;

there are multiple compounds in various stages of clinical development, Mast Therapeutics, or Mast, is conducting a Phase 3 trial for a drug (MST-188) to treat VOC once the crisis is underway. 

&#160; 

In addition, there are a number of other compounds that are in clinical development as either prophylactic or gene therapy/blood transfusion approaches to treat patients with sickle cell anemia, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Prophylactic Approaches: Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. (L-glutamine); Selexys Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SelG1); Baxter International (Aes-103); and Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT440). 

&#183; 

Gene Therapy/Blood Transfusion Approaches: Blue Bird Bio (Lentiglobin BB305); Sangamo Biosciences/Biogen Idec (ZFN Knockout); and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (BPX-501). 

Although bone marrow transplant is currently available and can be curative for sickle cell disease, its use is limited by the lack of availability of matched donors and by the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease and infection. Attempts to develop a cure through gene therapy remain at an early stage, but if these approaches were to be successful and received regulatory approval, this could limit the market for a drug such as rivipansel. 

&#160; 

GMI-1271: Hematologic Malignancies 

&#160; 

Our drug discovery, development and commercialization activities in oncology face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies . As the treatment landscape for AML and MM changes, there is substantial risk that GMI-1271 might not provide additional benefit over other therapies. 

&#160; 

While many chemotherapies in development for hematologic malignancies will likely be complementary to GMI-1271, there are also therapies in development that could be directly competitive with GMI-1271. In particular, there are a number of CXCR4 antagonists in clinical development that target the bone marrow microenvironment in order to mobilize and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy, including Sanofi-Aventis (Mozobil), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS-936564), NOXXON Pharma (NOX-A12), and BioLine RX (BL-8040). 

Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

United States Government Regulation 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an 

&#160;

approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#183; 

performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance; and 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical Studies 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted 

&#160;

diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to FDA&#8217;s published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness of the indication studied, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins for an SPA to be approved. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented in an SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA and made part of the administrative record. 

&#160; 

Even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement under the following circumstances: 

&#183; 

public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, or the director of the review division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy has been identified after testing has begun; 

&#183; 

a sponsor fails to follow a protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA; or 

&#183; 

the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by the sponsor in a request for SPA change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts. 

A documented SPA may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. An SPA, however, does not guarantee that a trial will be successful. 

Marketing Approval 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

&#160;

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, quality and purity. 

The FDA typically refers questions regarding novel drugs to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP. 

The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 

To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA 

&#160;

agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 

The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the &#8220;filing&#8221; date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 

In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 

Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing 

&#160;

process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

&#160; 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 

Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 

&#160;

The reach of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Federal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 

We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, as well as state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, 

&#160;

disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

The future commercial success of our drug candidates and our or any of our collaborator&#8217;s ability to commercialize any approved drug candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our drug candidates. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare or Medicaid programs, provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the EU and other potentially significant markets for our drug candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 

Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our drugs and drug candidates or exclusion of our drugs and drug candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved drug candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our drug candidates in whole or in part. 

Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 

There have been several U.S. government initiatives over the past few years to fund and incentivize certain comparative effectiveness research, including creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute under 

&#160;

PPACA. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our drug candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drug candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 

PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, PPACA extends manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability, expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program. At this time, we are unsure of the full impact that PPACA will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our drug candidates, once approved, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our drug candidates once they are approved. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 

As a result of PPACA, Medicare payments are increasingly tied to quality of care and value measures, and reporting of related data by providers such as physicians and hospitals. So called &#8220;value based reimbursement&#8221; measures may present challenges as well as potential opportunities for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicare incentives for providers meeting certain quality measures may ultimately prove beneficial for manufacturers that are able to establish that their products may help providers to meet such measures. However, manufacturers&#8217; ability to market their drug products based on quality or value is highly regulated and not always permissible. In addition, the potentially decreased Medicare reimbursement to those providers that fail to adequately comply with quality reporting requirements could translate to decreased resources available to purchase products and may negatively impact marketing or utilization of our drug candidates if they are approved for marketing. We cannot predict at this time what impact, if any, the longer-term shift towards value based reimbursement will have on any of our drug candidates in either the Medicare program, or in any other third party payor programs that may similarly tie payment to provider quality. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will continue through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Listing 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. 

&#160;

Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication. 

The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#183; 

the required patent information has not been filed; 

&#183; 

the listed patent has expired; 

&#183; 

the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 

&#183; 

the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity 

Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. 

The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#160;

Orphan Drug Exclusivity 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or biologics license application. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. We have received orphan drug designation for rivipansel, and we intend to seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for our other drug candidates whenever it is available. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits. 

Pediatric Exclusivity 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. If any of our drug candidates is approved, we anticipate seeking pediatric exclusivity when it is appropriate. 

Foreign Regulation 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our drug candidates. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 38 full-time employees, all of whom are located in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
