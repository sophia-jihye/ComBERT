Overview 

&#160; 

Daniels Corporate Advisory has established a permanent base upon which to provide the corporate strategy consulting services noted below, through a variety of methods: including the issunace of additional shares in private placement and/or issuance of anti-dilutive Convertible Preferred Stock and loans from senior officers to provide the necessary working capital of the Company to sustain activities under any consulting assignment obtained through the networking of senior executives or through the initial purchase of rights to be the provider of choice to offer a financial specialty package inclulding corporate strategy to clients of other financial/business services companies. While rights agreements of this nature are not typical, senior management, drawing on personal contacts and those of credentially members of its Corporate Strategy Advisory Board believes that offering to provide a very select service that would be very costly to duplicate with permanent in-house professionals and will augment other financial services already being offered/implemented by the financial/business services firm (a referral generator) entering into the rights agreement with Daniels Corporate Advisory, will be an acceptable additional option. However, there is no assurance that has time goes by a client may decide to enter our business and there is no provision in our agreement to prevent that from happening. However, our senior management believes that our success with the ultimate client, the client network member of a financial/business services client, will determine whether Daniels Corporate Advisory retains the client or not. 

&#160; 

The services incorporated into corporate strategy advisory and implementation to help formulate a path for the acceleration of corporate development (growth) include market analysis, negotiation, deal structure and determination of finance alternatives for the creation of joint-ventures, marketing agreements, new product/creation additions and acquisitions. Daniels Corporate Advisory has a loosely organized cadre of highly-qualified, independent contractors/consultants available to perform the necessary services to achieve the optimum corporate strategy for a client. 

&#160; 

Services will also be provided in corporate financial advisory, which, like corporate strategy, is a specialized segment of corporate advisory. It deals more with operations/cost control issues that can be established in-house with the aid of our on-call professionals. These offerings would be extremely expensive to do in-house by any potentially competitive financial service firm retaining Daniels Corporate Advisory, on behalf of on of its clients, because of its fixed overhead. 

&#160; 

Daniels is developing direct methods for the acquisition of clients, namely advertising in industry niches of interest and subsequent referral by a stockholder or partner . Name brand recognition is expected to be created after one or two successful corporate strategy assignments and the publicizing of these events on web sites related to this specialty, ours and theirs, on the worldwide web. 

&#160; 

Daniels Corporate Advisory is operating at the present time through the corporate strategy segment of its business in order to build its own critical mass by creation of start-up subisidaries it believes to have promise/potential, with the stated goal of the parent (DCAC) company to meet the financial requirements necessary for major Stock Exchange Listing. Senior management and its Advisory Board are providing preliminary services to three such potential clients; one under a formal LOI (Letter of Intent) and two in final negotiations. 

&#160; 

As our presence in the market place becomes more visible, through publication on client websites of our successes in our initial corporate strategy consulting assignments added financing options are expected to materialize for the benefit of our clients. Capital companies and high-net worth (accredited) individuals may contact us to see if they may participate directly in subsequent assignments.

Recent Business Developments 

&#160; 

The Company conducts on-going networking and business development in corporate strategy through its chairman, on a chairman to chairman basis, through the networks of its Advisory Board Members and its expanded, independent contractor consulting team. A full range of disciplines are offered to the nano-cap public and private company through personalized relationship networking to keep initial marketing costs at a minimum. Disciplines being offered are operational strategies, market-planning, senior oversight management and financial alternatives consulting on optimum paths for the client to take. This could include but not be limited to external growth alternatives requiring advisory on M &#38; A, levered transactions, capital structure, bridge loans, and equity financing. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy - Current Operational Strategy &#38; Current Client Projects: 

&#160; 

Daniels creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professinal talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the US and in Foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through the networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy consultants believe are needed in a jointly-venture, (jointly-controlled) undertaking created for the client&#8217;s optimum growth. 

&#160; 

Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies /opportunities including joint-ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in LBO format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones. 

&#160; 

The Goal : Within twenty-four months from commencement of a Corporate Strategy Assignment, financial results, aided by all participating players, should be forthcoming and recorded in SEC Filings. At the same time, a senior mangement team and Board expanded with highly-credible interim (or permanent) professionals (directors) will be provded in order to successfully navigate the listing process of a major Stock Exchange. While Daniels believes this process should be successful in the above-noted, time period, there is some uncertainity in the process which is dependent upon any past issues the listing committee of a specific exchange may deem necessary to be addressed prior to uplifting. 

&#160; 

A similar effort will be provided to tailor an optimum growth program for the private company client, whether it chooses to remain private or to become a public company through alternative merger opportunities. 

&#160; 

Current Projects: Start-Up Subsidiaries To be Expanded in Fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Just After the Close of Fiscal 2015, Daniels Food &#38; Beverage Group was launched and continues to grow and meet initial objectives. The Company purchased a permanent option for $27,500 to provide advisory and some capital to acquire a candidate for the Italian Cafe&#8217;s segment of its announced business model. The initial target company does approximately $185,000 in revenues and generates a profit of $75,000. The total purchase price is $100,000 with the option value contributed as part payment. An operating partner corporation with significant, related experience is joint-venturing with Daniels in the further build-out of the Italian Cafe&#8217;s segment of the Food &#38; Beverage Group. Daniels intends to consummate this transaction during the first half of the current fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Further expansion of the Consulting segment of our business model and that of the Food &#38; Beverage Group is anticipated through our Letter Of Intent with Island Hospitality Concepts, Inc. (&#8220;IHC&#8221;). This Consulting Group develops and executes on restaurant themes for expansion in the Islands, initially concentrating in the Dominican Republic. It has a successful 30 year history and has already developed several profitable island brands that can be built out further through a Daniels incubation project and them offered through a Franchising Program.

Other Start-Up Potentials in discussions/negotations at the current time include one in Merchant Finance and one in Construction - specifically, the reconstruction of disaster damaged properties. 

&#160; 

OPTIMUM GROWTH STRATEGY: 

&#160; 

Twelve to Twenty four Month Horizons for Daniels&#8217; Objectives: 

&#160; 

Daniels&#8217; believes that the validity of its corporate strategy model will be proven further through the success of several of its client/incubation/subsidiary deals. The Company plans to use its publicly traded common stock, in a variety of securities packages, including anti-dilutive Convertible Preferreds, to finance a subsidiary start-up, initially for generic sales/profits growth. Subsequent growth options noted above will be applied as external growth becomes a secondary goal. This method of two stage (generic and then external) growth is designed to leave existing client management with commanding equity and operating control positions. Eventually, an optimum exit strategy will be developed for the subsidiary, one that returns a significant return on corporate (parent) capital. The choices of optimum exit strategies could include bringing a subsidiary public, directly, or merging it with a public company operating in one of the more profitable niches of the specific market designated for expansion. The same corporate strategy model can/will be applied to any independent mini-cap public client. 

&#160; 

We believe our business model to be scalable. Based upon the potential success of the initial corporate strategy consulting assignments creating our uplifitng to a major Stock Exchange, Daniels may entertain the creation of a franchising plan for key US Cities and Foreign Capitals or Finance Centers. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Daniels senior management will concentrate its efforts to expand its corporate strategy and financial advisory services and related specialties in the nano-cap segment of the private and public markets, where Daniels believes it will be effective. Marketing efforts will increase through social and print media efforts and will be in addition to those methods already mentioned herein. 

Daniels objective is to create and help manage implementation of accelerated expansion strategies and in so doing, aid in the creation of financing alternatives to accomplish client goals. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive price and performance characteristics. 

&#160; 

In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices and choose only those assignments with new clients, that have pressing goals to be met, that offer Daniels optimum potential for profits and growth. 

&#160; 

The &#8220;collective&#8221; corporate financial services, including merchant banking/private equity, are very competitive and fragmented in the Company&#8217;s market niche. There are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources. We are and will continue to offer equity compensation to our team of Advisory Board Members, and independent strategy consultants in order to keep a stable, cohesive team of professionals, which is necessary and key to the creation of operating and capital solutions in a timely fashion.
