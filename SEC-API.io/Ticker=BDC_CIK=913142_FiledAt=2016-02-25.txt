Customers 

We sell to distributors, OEMs, installers, and end-users. Sales to the distributor Anixter International Inc. represented approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues in 2015. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2015. 

We have supply agreements with distributors and OEM customers. In general, our customers are not contractually obligated to buy our products exclusively, in minimum amounts, or for a significant period of time. We believe that our relationships with our customers and distributors are good and that they are loyal to Belden products as a result of our reputation, the breadth of our product portfolio, the quality and performance characteristics of our products, and our customer service and technical support, among other reasons. 

International Operations 

In addition to manufacturing facilities in the United States (U.S.), we have manufacturing and other operating facilities in Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, and St. Kitts, as well as in various countries in Europe. During 2015, approximately 45% of Belden&#146;s sales were to customers outside the U.S. Our primary channels to international markets include both distributors and direct sales to end users and OEMs. 

Financial information for Belden by country is shown in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Competition 

We face substantial competition in our major markets. The number and size of our competitors vary depending on the product line and segment. Some multinational competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we have. There are also many regional competitors that have more limited product offerings. 

The markets in which we operate can be generally categorized as highly competitive with many players. In order to maximize our competitive advantages, we manage our product portfolio to capitalize on secular trends and high-growth applications in those markets. Based on available data for our served markets, we estimate that our market share ranges from approximately 5% &#150; 20%. A substantial acquisition in one of our served markets would be necessary to meaning fully change our estimated market share percentage. 

The principal competitive factors in all our product markets are technical features, quality, availability, price, customer support, and distribution coverage. The relative importance of each of these factors varies depending on the customer. Some products are manufactured to meet published industry specifications and are less differentiated on the basis of product characteristics. We believe that Belden stands out in many of its markets on the basis of our reputation, the breadth of our product portfolio, the quality and performance characteristics of our products, our customer service, and our technical support. 

Research and Development 

We conduct research and development on an ongoing basis, including new and existing product development, testing and analysis, and process and equipment development and testing. See the Consolidated Statements of Operations for amounts incurred for research and development. Many of the markets we serve are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities, including advances driven by the expansion of digital technology, which require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. Our markets are also subject to increasing requirements for mobility, information security, and transmission reliability. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products that meet or anticipate such changes in our served markets. 

&#160;

Our most significant investments in research and development occur in our Broadcast, Network Security, and Industrial IT platforms. The research and development investments for these platforms include a focus on the following developments: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In the broadcast market, the trend towards increasingly complex broadcast production, management, and distribution environments continues to evolve. Our end-use customers need to increase efficiency and enhance workflow through systems and infrastructure. Our broadcast products allow content producers, broadcasters, and service providers to manage the increasingly complex broadcast signals throughout their operations. 

In order to support the demand for additional bandwidth and to improve service integrity, broadband service providers are investing in their networks to enhance delivery capabilities to customers for the foreseeable future. Additional bandwidth requirements as a result of increased traffic expose weak points in the network, which are often connectivity related, causing broadband service operators to improve and upgrade residential networks with higher performing connectivity products. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; For network security products, there is a compelling need among global enterprises, service providers and government agencies to detect, prevent and respond to cyber security threats. This is a long-standing need within corporate networks, but we believe the rapid proliferation of new devices in the &#147;internet of things&#148; will cause this need to broaden and accelerate. Additionally, cyber-attacks are moving beyond traditional targets into critical infrastructure, which will further amplify the importance of our work in network security. 

Part of our research and development is focused on creating scalable, efficient technologies to provide real-time instrumentation and analytics across entire networks. This includes delivering high-fidelity visibility and deep intelligence about networked systems, their vulnerabilities, and providing actionable information about how to effectively secure them. Additionally, we have highly-skilled and active research teams who analyze current and anticipated threats, and provide offerings to the market to enable customers to quickly detect and resolve cybersecurity threats. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In the industrial networking market, there is a growing trend toward adoption of industrial Ethernet technology, bringing to the critical infrastructure the advantages of digital communication and the ability to network devices made by different manufacturers and integrate them with enterprise systems. While the adoption of this technology is at a more advanced stage in certain regions of the world, we believe that the trend will globalize. This trend will also lead to a rising need for wireless systems for some applications and for cybersecurity to protect this critical infrastructure. 

Our research and development efforts are also focused on fiber optic technology, which presents a potential substitute for certain of the copper-based products that comprise a portion of our revenues. Fiber optic cables have certain advantages over copper-based cables in applications where large amounts of information must travel significant distances and where high levels of information security are required. While the cost to interface electronic and optical light signals and to terminate and connect optical fiber remains comparatively high, we expect that in future years the cost difference versus traditional copper networks will diminish. We sell fiber optic infrastructure, and many customers specify these products in combination with copper-based infrastructure. The final stage of most networks remains almost exclusively copper-based, and we expect that it will continue to be copper for the foreseeable future. However, if a significant decrease in the cost of fiber optic systems relative to the cost of copper-based systems were to occur, such systems could become superior on a price/performance basis to copper-based systems. Part of our research and development efforts focus on expanding our fiber-optic based product portfolio. 

&#160;

Patents and Trademarks 

We have a policy of seeking patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products, product improvements, and advances in equipment and processes as part of our ongoing research, development, and manufacturing activities. We own many patents and registered trademarks worldwide that are used by our operating segments, with pending applications for numerous others. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets. Our most prominent trademarks are: Belden &#174; , Alpha Wire&#153;, Mohawk &#174; , West Penn Wire&#153;, Hirschmann &#174; , Lumberg Automation&#153;, SignalTight &#174; , GarrettCom &#174; , Poliron&#153;, Tofino &#174; , PPC &#174; , Grass Valley &#174; , ProSoft Technology &#174; , and Tripwire &#174; . 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw material used in many of our cable products is copper. Other materials we purchase in large quantities include fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene, aluminum-clad steel and copper-clad steel conductors, aluminum, brass, other metals, optical fiber, printed circuit boards, and electronic components. With respect to all major raw materials used by us, we generally have either alternative sources of supply or access to alternative materials. Supplies of these materials are generally adequate and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. 

Over the past three years, the prices of metals, particularly copper, have been highly volatile. The chart below illustrates the high and low spot prices per pound of copper over the last three years. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Copper spot prices per pound

&#160; &#160; &#160; High

&#160; $ 2.95 &#160; &#160; $ 3.43 &#160; &#160; $ 3.78 &#160; Low

&#160; $ 2.02 &#160; &#160; $ 2.54 &#160; &#160; $ 3.03 &#160; Prices for materials such as PVC and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks have also fluctuated. Since Belden utilizes the first in, first out (FIFO) inventory costing methodology, the impact of copper and other raw material cost changes on our cost of goods sold is delayed by approximately two months based on our inventory turns. 

While we generally are able to adjust our pricing for fluctuations in commodity prices, we can experience short-term favorable or unfavorable variances. When the cost of raw materials increases, we are generally able to recover these costs through higher pricing of our finished products. The majority of our products are sold through distribution, and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists, which we update from time to time, with new prices typically taking effect a few weeks after they are announced. Some OEM customer contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes, generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months. 

Backlog 

Our business is characterized generally by short-term order and shipment schedules. Our backlog consists of product orders for which we have received a customer purchase order or purchase commitment and which have not yet been shipped. Orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. As of December 31, 2015, our backlog of orders believed to be firm was $184.8 million. The majority of the backlog at December 31, 2015 is scheduled to be shipped in 2016. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, and discharge of materials into the environment, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Clean Air Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act; and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We believe that our existing environmental control procedures and accrued liabilities are adequate, and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 8,200 employees worldwide. We also utilized approximately 500 workers under contract manufacturing arrangements. Approximately 1,800 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements at various locations around the world. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good.

Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

We make forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in other materials we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public, and on our website. In addition, our senior management might make forward-looking statements orally to investors, analysts, the media, and others. Statements concerning our future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition, future economic performance (including growth and earnings) and demand for our products and services, and other statements of our plans, beliefs, or expectations, including the statements contained in Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. In some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;forecast,&#148; &#147;guide,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;can,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;would,&#148; and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions, risks, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, among others, those set forth in the following section and in the other documents that we file with the SEC. 

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
