Recent Events 

&#160; 

In February 2016, Novavax completed the issuance of $325 million of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2023, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $315 million, after deducting initial purchasers&#8217; discounts and commissions, and approximately $314 million after deducting offering expenses. We used approximately $38 million of the net proceeds to pay the costs of a capped call transaction, which will function to reduce dilution from issuance of additional shares upon conversion of the notes between the note conversion price of $6.81 and the cap price of $9.73 per share. The resulting final net proceeds to the company were approximately $276 million.

&#160;

Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on December 31, 2015 of approximately $231 million, as adjusted to give effect to the final net proceeds of the Convertible Senior Note offering of approximately $276 million, before giving effect to the anticipated use of the final net proceeds, would result in an as adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately $507 million.

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

Novavax, Inc., together with its wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB, is a clinical-stage vaccine company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines and adjuvants. Using innovative proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine platform technology, we produce vaccine candidates to efficiently and effectively respond to both known and emerging disease threats.

&#160;

We were incorporated in 1987 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20878, and our telephone number is (240) 268-2000. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;NVAX.&#8221;

&#160;

Our vaccine candidates are genetically engineered three-dimensional nanostructures that incorporate recombinant proteins critical to disease pathogenesis. Our product pipeline targets a variety of infectious diseases with vaccine candidates currently in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (&#8220;RSV&#8221;), seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza, and Ebola virus (&#8220;EBOV&#8221;). We have additional preclinical stage programs for a variety of infectious diseases.

&#160;

We are also developing proprietary technology for the production of immune stimulating saponin-based adjuvants, through Novavax AB. Our lead adjuvant, Matrix-M&#8482;, has been successfully tested in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our pandemic influenza H7N9 vaccine candidate and in a Phase 1 clinical trial for our EBOV vaccine candidate. Genocea Biosciences, Inc. has licensed rights to our Matrix technology and is now conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with its herpes simplex 2 vaccine candidate using Matrix-M.

&#160;

Clinical Product Pipeline 

&#160;

Our clinical product pipeline includes vaccine candidates engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses with potential to provide increased protection. Our nanoparticle technology platform targets antigens with conserved epitopes essential for viral function. Unlike traditional vaccines that &#8216;mimic&#8217; viruses and elicit the naturally occurring immune responses to them, our nanoparticles are engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses, which may be more efficacious than naturally-occurring immunity. We believe our vaccine technology can be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseases.

*As detailed herein, our funding and development arrangement with PATH expired in April 2015; we entered into a grant agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in September 2015.

&#160;

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) 

&#160;

We are developing our respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (&#8220;RSV F Vaccine&#8221;) for three susceptible target populations: older adults (60 years of age and older), infants via maternal immunization and children six months to five years of age (&#8220;pediatrics&#8221;). We estimate RSV F Vaccine peak revenue potential of six to eight billion dollars worldwide. Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available.

&#160;

Repeat infections and lifelong susceptibility to RSV are common; we estimate the current global cost burden of RSV in excess of $88 billion. Despite decades of effort to develop an RSV vaccine, there are currently no licensed vaccines. Although the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis&#174;) is effective in pre-term infants, it is not indicated for use in other populations. Novavax made a breakthrough in developing a vaccine that targets the fusion protein, or F-protein, of the RSV virus. The F-protein contains a highly conserved amino acid sequence called antigenic site II, which we believe is an ideal vaccine target. Palivizumab, which also targets antigenic site II, has demonstrated protection in five randomized clinical trials. We genetically engineered a novel F-protein antigen and enhanced its immunogenicity by exposing antigenic site II. Novavax&#8217; RSV F Vaccine assembles into a recombinant protein nanoparticle optimized for F-protein antigen presentation. The RSV F Vaccine elicits palivizumab-competing antibodies at levels that we expect to confer protection. The Novavax RSV F Vaccine is the first RSV vaccine to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial, and Novavax is positioned to bring the first RSV vaccine to market to combat the 64 million RSV infections that occur each year. 1,2

RSV Older Adults Program 

&#160;

Burden of Disease 

&#160;

Adults 60 years of age and older are at increased risk for RSV disease due to age related declines in their immune systems. In this population, RSV is an important respiratory virus, distinct from influenza viruses, that is responsible for serious lower respiratory tract disease and may lead to hospitalization or even death. Additionally, RSV infection can lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and congestive heart failure. RSV infection occurs as a recurrent and predictable annual epidemic throughout the world. In the U.S. alone, the incidence rate is 2.5 million infections per year, and RSV is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of 64 million older adults. 3 ,4 Based on our analysis of published literature applied to 2014 population estimates in the U.S., the disease causes 207,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths among adults older than 65. Annually, we estimate that there are approximately 900,000 medical interventions directly caused by RSV disease across all populations in the U.S.

&#160; &#160; 

Clinical Trial Update 

&#160;

In August 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 1,600 older adults. The clinical trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with RSV infection, in community-living older adults who were treated with placebo. The trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Finally, the trial estimated the efficacy of our RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to RSV. The trial was the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active RSV immunization in any clinical trial population. In the per protocol population, the clinical trial showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease (41%) and, in an ad hoc analysis, showed a decrease in RSV disease with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (45%) in older adults. The clinical trial established an attack rate for symptomatic RSV disease of 4.9% in older adults, 95% of which included lower respiratory track symptoms. Efficacy against more severe RSV illness, defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms associated with difficulty breathing, was 64% in ad hoc analyses.

&#160;

We initiated a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as Resolve&#8482;, of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults in November 2015, and in December 2015 we completed enrollment of 11,850 older adult subjects at 60 sites in the U.S. The primary objective of the clinical trial is the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease, as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. We expect to provide top-line data from this clinical trial in the third quarter of 2016.

&#160;

In October 2015, we completed enrollment of 1,330 older adults in our Phase 2 rollover clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in the older adults who had participated in the recently concluded prior Phase 2 clinical trial. This trial is designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in response to immunization with the RSV F Vaccine during a second RSV season, and we expect to provide top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2016.

&#160;

RSV Infants via Maternal Immunization Program 

&#160;

Burden of Disease 

&#160;

RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. 5 In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants, and globally, is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age. 6,7 Despite the induction of post-infection immunity, repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV is common. 8,9 

&#160;

Clinical Trial Update 

&#160;

In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 50 healthy pregnant women and their infants. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine in pregnant women in their third trimester, and assessed the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine. The trial also examined the impact of maternal immunization on infant safety during the first year of life and RSV-specific antibody levels through the infants&#8217; first six months of life. Immunized women demonstrated a geometric mean 14-fold rise in anti-F IgG, 29-fold rise in palivizumab-competing antibodies and a 2.7 and 2.1-fold rise in microneutralization titers against RSV/A and RSV/B respectively. In contrast, women who received placebo demonstrated no significant change in antibody levels. The infants&#8217; antibody levels at delivery averaged 90-100% of the mothers&#8217; levels, indicating efficient transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to infant. The estimated half-lives of infant PCA, anti-F IgG, RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralizing antibodies, based on data through day 60, were 41, 30, 36 and 34 days, respectively.

&#160;

&#160;

We announced the initiation of a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, known as Prepare&#8482;, of the RSV F Vaccine in 5,000 to 8,255 healthy pregnant women in December 2015. The primary objective of the Prepare trial is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F Vaccine against symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection with hypoxemia in infants through the first 90 days of life. This Phase 3 trial utilizes a group sequential design and is expected to take between two and four years to complete. This trial is supported by a grant (the &#8220;Grant&#8221;) of up to $89.1 million from the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation (&#8220;BMGF&#8221;). The Grant will support development activities, product licensing efforts and WHO prequalification of our RSV F Vaccine. We concurrently entered into a Global Access Commitments Agreement (&#8220;GACA&#8221;) with BMGF as a part of the grant agreement (the &#8220;Grant Agreement&#8221;). Under the terms of the GACA, we agreed to make the RSV F Vaccine available and accessible at affordable pricing to people in certain low and middle income countries.

&#160;

In November 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) granted Fast Track designation to our RSV F Vaccine for protection of infants via maternal immunization. Fast Track designation is intended for products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. The program is designed to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously.

&#160; 

RSV Pediatric Program 

&#160;

Burden of Disease 

&#160;

There are currently approximately 18 million children in the U.S. between six months and five years of age. 10 Based on our analysis of published literature applied to 2014 population estimates, we estimate nearly 9.8 million RSV infections annually. In the U.S., RSV is responsible for approximately 57,000 hospitalizations of children under five years of age annually, the vast majority of which occur in infants less than one year old, and especially those under six months of age. 11 ,12, 13 ,14, 15 

&#160;

Clinical Trial Update 

&#160;

In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine, with one or two doses, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Trial enrollment was concluded with a smaller than planned cohort so that dosing could be completed ahead of the 2014-15 RSV season. The vaccine was well-tolerated and serum samples collected from a subset of 18 immunized children in the per-protocol population demonstrated that the RSV F Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all formulations and regimens. There were greater than 10-fold increases in both anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the adjuvanted group and greater than 6-fold increases in anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the unadjuvanted group. We are assessing the data from this clinical trial and evaluating the next steps in the development of our RSV F Vaccine for pediatrics.

&#160;

Influenza 

&#160;

Influenza is a world-wide infectious disease that causes illness in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening or even death. Serious illness occurs not only in susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults, but also in the general population when unique strains of influenza arise, for which most humans have not developed protective antibodies. We are developing vaccine candidates for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccine growth in the top seven markets (U.S., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), show potential growth from approximately $3.2 billion in the 2012/13 season to $5.3 billion by the 2021/2022 season. 16

&#160;

&#160;

Traditional vaccine manufacturing methods utilize live influenza virus to infect eggs in order to produce trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidates. Our recombinant nanoparticle technology does not utilize either a live influenza virus or eggs, but rather a recombinant baculovirus and insect cells which allows for the product to be potentially rapidly manufactured and quickly adapted to changing influenza strains. We are developing a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, which we expect to elicit broader protection from circulating influenza strains; we are also exploring the development of novel influenza nanoparticle vaccine candidates. There are currently four quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines licensed in the U.S., although additional quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines are expected to be licensed over the next several years.

&#160;

Quadrivalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccine 

&#160;

Burden of Disease 

&#160;

The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices of the CDC recommends that all persons aged six months and older be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza. Influenza is a major burden on public health worldwide; an estimated one million deaths each year are attributed to influenza. 17 It is further estimated that, each year, influenza attacks 5%-10% of adults and 20%-30% of children, causing significant levels of illness, hospitalization and death . 18 Recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines, like the candidate we are developing, have important advantages: once licensed for commercial sale, large quantities of vaccines can be potentially manufactured quickly and in a cost-effective manner, without the use of either the live influenza virus or eggs.

&#160;

Clinical Trial Update 

&#160;

In July 2015, we reported positive data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of our quadrivalent seasonal influenza virus-like particle (&#8220;VLP&#8221;) vaccine candidate in 400 healthy adults that we initiated in November 2014. These data show that our quadrivalent seasonal influenza VLP vaccine candidate is well-tolerated, and can induce influenza antibody responses that met the immunogenicity targets. These results demonstrate the potential for our seasonal quadrivalent influenza VLP vaccine candidate to meet the FDA criteria for accelerated approval.

&#160;

We were awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (&#8220;HHS BARDA&#8221;) in 2011 to fund the development of both our quadrivalent seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates. This is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which reimburses us for allowable direct contract costs incurred, allowable indirect costs, plus a fixed-fee, earned in the ongoing clinical development and product scale-up of our vaccine candidates. We announced that HHS BARDA had exercised and initiated a two-year option to our contract in September 2014. The option not only extended the contract until September 2016, but also added scope to support our development activities leading up to planned Phase 3 clinical studies and $70 million of funding on top of the remainder of the $97 million base period funding. In June 2015, the contract was amended to increase the funding by $7.7 million to allow for the recovery of additional costs under the contract relating to the settlement of indirect rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. This additional amount was received and recorded as revenue in the second quarter of 2015. During 2015, we recognized revenue of $33.3 million and have recognized approximately $112 million in revenue since the inception of the contract. In recent meetings with HHS BARDA, we have been discussing the next steps in both our seasonal influenza VLP vaccine program and our pandemic influenza VLP vaccine program, as well as some of the delays associated with our development of both vaccine candidates. We expect to continue discussions with HHS BARDA during 2016 and to present plans for continued clinical and product development, although there can be no guarantee that the HHS BARDA contract will not be terminated early or will be extended beyond September 2016.

Pandemic H7N9 Influenza Vaccine 

&#160;

Burden of Disease 

&#160;

Prevention of the potential devastation of a human influenza pandemic remains a key priority with both governmental health authorities and influenza vaccine manufacturers. In the U.S. alone, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic led to the production of approximately 126 million doses of monovalent (single strain) vaccine. Public health awareness and government preparedness for the next potential influenza pandemic are driving development of vaccines that can be manufactured quickly against a potentially threatening influenza strain. Industry and health experts have focused attention on developing a monovalent influenza vaccine against either the H5N1 strain or the H7N9 strain as potential key defenses against future pandemic disease threats.

&#160;

Clinical Trial Update 

&#160;

We have developed and delivered compelling safety and immunogenicity data on two pandemic vaccine candidates, H5N1 and H7N9. In September 2014, we announced positive results from a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our pandemic H7N9 influenza VLP vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Matrix-M in 610 healthy adults. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial was designed as a dose-ranging, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, to determine the contribution of Matrix-M to potential antigen dose sparing regimens. Our H7N9 influenza vaccine candidate, with and without Matrix-M, was highly immunogenic and well tolerated. Matrix-M adjuvanted formulations demonstrated immunogenicity and dose-sparing benefits relative to unadjuvanted antigen. Hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers were comparable to those reported in prior studies and the vaccine elicited significant anti-neuraminidase antibodies. In October 2014, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to our pandemic H7N9 influenza vaccine candidate with Matrix-M.

&#160;

Our pandemic influenza vaccine program is supported by our HHS BARDA contract. Like our seasonal influenza vaccine program, we expect to continue discussions with HHS BARDA during 2016 and to present plans for continued clinical and product development of our pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, although there can be no guarantee that the HHS BARDA contract will not be terminated early or will be extended beyond September 2016.

&#160;

Combination Respiratory (Influenza and RSV) 

&#160;

Given the ongoing development of our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate and our RSV F Vaccine, we see an important opportunity to develop a combination respiratory vaccine candidate. Early preclinical development efforts have given us confidence that such a combination vaccine is viable, and in animal models, provides acceptable immunogenicity. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of a combination respiratory vaccine in the first half of 2017.

&#160;

Ebola Virus (EBOV) 

&#160;

EBOV, formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Multiple strains of EBOV have been identified, the most recent of which, the Makona EBOV strain, is associated with a case fatality rate of between 50% and 90%. 19 There are currently no licensed treatments proven to neutralize the virus, but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development. It should be noted, however, that recent vaccine approaches target either a previous strain of the virus or were initially developed to be delivered by genetic vectors. In contrast, our EBOV glycoprotein vaccine candidate (&#8220;Ebola GP Vaccine&#8221;) was developed using the Makona EBOV strain.

&#160;

In July 2015, we announced data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our Ebola GP Vaccine in ascending doses, with and without our Matrix-M adjuvant, in 230 healthy adults. Participants received either one or two intramuscular injections ranging from 6.5&#181;g to 50&#181;g of antigen, with or without adjuvant, or placebo. Immunogenicity was assessed at multiple time points, including days 28 and 35. These Phase 1 data demonstrated that our Ebola GP Vaccine is highly immunogenic, well-tolerated and, in conjunction with our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, resulted in significant antigen dose-sparing. Although the adjuvanted Ebola GP Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all dose levels, the adjuvanted two-dose regimens induced Ebola anti-GP antibody geometric mean responses between 45,000 and 70,000 ELISA units, representing a 500 to 750-fold rise over baseline at day 35. In 2015, we also announced successful data from two separate non-human primate challenge studies of our Ebola GP Vaccine in which, in both cases, the challenge was lethal for the control animal, whereas 100% of the immunized animals were protected.

CPLB Programs (India) 

&#160;

Our joint venture with Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (&#8220;Cadila&#8221;), CPL Biologics Private Limited (&#8220;CPLB&#8221;), is actively developing and manufacturing vaccine candidates in India that were genetically engineered by Novavax. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila.

&#160;

Seasonal Influenza 

&#160;

CPLB received marketing authorization, the Indian equivalent of approval of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;), for its recombinant trivalent seasonal VLP influenza vaccine in 2015. Because the market for seasonal influenza vaccines in India is limited and highly competitive, CPLB is currently evaluating its marketing strategy for this vaccine.

&#160;

Rabies 

&#160;

CPLB successfully completed Stage II of its 2-stage Phase 1/2 clinical trial in India of a rabies G protein vaccine candidate that we genetically engineered. The objective was to select a dose and regimen for a recombinant vaccine that can be administered both as a pre-exposure prophylaxis for residents of certain higher-risk geographies and travelers to such locations, and as a post-exposure prophylaxis using fewer doses than the current standard of care. In October 2014, CPLB presented clinical results from Stage I of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, demonstrating that vaccine recipients, at various doses levels and schedules, showed seroprotective antibody levels at day 14 that were sustained through day 180. The vaccine candidate, which was found to be well-tolerated, also induced seroprotective levels with two-dose and three-dose regimens. CPLB has received permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial and is considering the optimal schedule for its conduct.

&#160;

Discovery Programs 

&#160;

Our vaccine platform technology provides an efficient system that has the potential to rapidly develop antigens to selected targets, refine manufacturing processes and optimize development across multiple vaccine candidates. In conjunction with global health authorities and government agencies, we believe we can address emerging disease threats with pandemic potential. In addition to our response to the H7N9 influenza strain, we have developed a vaccine candidate to Middle East respiratory syndrome (&#8220;MERS&#8221;), caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in 2012. MERS emerged as a disease threat in 2013, and is currently being monitored by global health agencies, with the WHO reporting significant confirmed cases of infection and deaths. The MERS virus is a part of the coronavirus family that includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (&#8220;SARS&#8221;). Within weeks of obtaining the sequence of the circulating MERS strain, we successfully produced a vaccine candidate designed to provide protection. This vaccine candidate is based on the major surface spike protein, which we had previously identified as the antigen of choice in our work with a SARS vaccine candidate. In 2014, in collaboration with the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, we published results that showed our investigational vaccine candidates against both MERS and SARS blocked infection in laboratory studies. Although the development of a MERS vaccine candidate currently remains a preclinical program, we believe that our MERS vaccine candidate offers a viable option to interested global public health authorities.

&#160;

Vaccine Platform Technology 

&#160;

Our recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine technology is based on self-assembly of surface protein antigens from pathogenic organisms including viruses, bacteria or parasites. The conformations of these nanoparticles are similar but not identical to the natural structure of surface antigens of disease organisms, and lack the genetic material required for replication and therefore are not infectious. One advantage of this technology is that the assembly of nanoparticles is done in vitro during the purification of these proteins. Potential immunological advantages of protein nanoparticles may be associated with the nanoparticle conformation and the presentation of key functional epitopes that are often immunologically hidden in the native pathogen. This leads to efficient recognition by the immune system&#8217;s antigen presenting cells (&#8220;APCs&#8221;) that trigger robust immune responses. Recognition of the nanoparticle vaccine&#8217;s repeating protein patterns by the APCs&#8217; toll-like receptors to stimulate innate immunity and the high purity and lack of synthetic material adds to the potential safety of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines. Protein nanoparticle vaccine technology has expanded our early-stage vaccines in development to include both virus and non-virus disease targets. Our most advanced protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate is our RSV F Vaccine, which self-assembles from our highly purified F-protein antigen.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Matrix Adjuvants 

&#160;

Adjuvants are predominantly used to enable a vaccine to induce a strong immune response including a greater production of antibodies and longer lasting protection against viral and bacterial infections. Adjuvants may increase the amplitude of the immune response and qualitatively change it, broaden its specificity to provide protection against related microorganisms and allow for effective immunization with much lower doses of antigen. Novavax AB has developed a number of adjuvant formulations, all based on our proprietary Matrix&#8482; technology. These adjuvant formulations possess excellent immunostimulatory features with the ability to increase and prolong the protective benefits of vaccines.

&#160;

While adjuvants based on novel, poorly characterized substances have been hampered by safety concerns and limited efficacy, Matrix adjuvants stimulate strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Matrix adjuvants may allow for lower antigen doses, longer-duration immune responses and carry a lower risk for allergic reactions or other adverse events. Our Matrix technology typically induces strong cellular activation of both Th1 and Th2 types, thereby generating all classes and subclasses of antibodies, as well as potent cellular responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Our Matrix-M adjuvant provides a potent adjuvant effect that has been well tolerated in clinical trials. We also believe that the strong immune response and opportunity to reduce the quantity of antigen dose can significantly reduce the production cost of our vaccines. This means that our Matrix-M adjuvant has the potential to be of immense value when there is inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity during an emerging disease threat such as an influenza pandemic.

&#160;

Competition in RSV, Influenza, EBOV and Other Vaccines 

&#160;

The vaccine market is intensely competitive, characterized by rapid technological progress. Our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make recombinant vaccines. We believe this system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely well-suited for developing an RSV vaccine, seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines, as well as vaccines against other infectious diseases.

&#160;

There is currently no approved RSV vaccine for sale in the world; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. In addition, many other companies are developing products to prevent disease caused by RSV using a variety of technology platforms, including various viral vector technologies and competitive recombinant technologies. We believe that our RSV vaccine candidate, utilizing a recombinant F-protein antigen, is more effective than RSV vaccine candidates in development by our competitors; however, such efficaciousness cannot be guaranteed. Although we are not aware of all our competitors&#8217; efforts, we believe that MedImmune LLC, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, may have the second most advanced RSV vaccine program after Novavax, as it has reported testing in Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials of an intranasal, recombinant, live attenuated, RSV vaccine for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, as well as a combination intranasal vaccine for the prevention of several infant respiratory illnesses, including RSV. Additional entities have also entered into early clinical trials including GlaxoSmithKline and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an institute under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIAID&#8221;).

&#160;

Unlike the comparatively low number of competitors developing RSV vaccines, there are a number of companies developing and selling vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza employing both historic and new vaccine technologies. There are many seasonal influenza vaccines currently approved and marketed, and most of these are marketed by major pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise. Competition in the sale of these seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, some by adding an adjuvant that is used to increase the immunogenicity of that product, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than currently marketed products. Another differentiating factor is recombinant manufacturing, which we believe can be quicker and less-expensive than traditional egg-based manufacturing. Despite the significant competition and advancing technologies, some of which are similar to our own, we believe that our seasonal influenza product will be as efficacious as, or more so than, current products or products being developed by our competitors, and that our manufacturing system provides savings in both time and money; however, there can be no guarantee that our seasonal influenza vaccine will prove to be efficacious or that our manufacturing system will prove to be sufficiently effective and differentiated to ensure commercial success.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Vaccine candidates against Ebola virus have been in development for more than a decade; however, with the recent epidemic in West Africa, focus on viable vaccine candidates has intensified. In addition to the Phase 1 clinical trial that we initiated in February 2015, WHO reports two other vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in humans: one by GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with NIAID, and the other by a collaboration of NewLink Genetics, Merck Vaccines USA and the Public Health Agency of Canada. While these other vaccine candidates offer promise, we believe there are accompanying challenges, including: high-dose level requirements; utilization of glycoprotein from older strains that have a significant number of amino acid changes when compared to the 2014 Makona strain; difficult storage requirements at temperatures below &#8211;60&#176;C; and challenges associated with immunity to the viral vectors which could limit their multi-dose vaccine potential. In contrast, we have developed a Phase 1 vaccine candidate that has performed well with low doses utilizing our Matrix-M adjuvant, was derived from the 2014 Makona strain, appears to be stable at 2&#8211;8&#176;C and appears to provide enhanced immunogenicity as a multi-dose vaccine.

&#160;

In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors&#8217; products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also may depend upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious, particularly in the relevant target populations and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sale.

&#160;

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the U.S. and abroad. The patent position of biopharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

&#160;

&#183; obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates; &#183; obtain licenses to use the technologies of third-parties, which may be protected by patents; &#183; protect our trade secrets and know-how; and &#183; operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. &#160; 

Patent Rights; Licenses. 

&#160;

We have intellectual property (patents, licenses, know-how) related to our vaccines, manufacturing processes and other technologies. Currently, we have or have rights to over 200 U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to vaccines and biologics. Our core vaccine-related intellectual property extends beyond the year 2025.

&#160;

Since 2007, we have maintained a non-exclusive license arrangement with Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly Wyeth Holdings Corporation), a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (&#8220;Wyeth&#8221;), to a family of patents and patent applications covering VLP technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields, with expected patent expiration in early 2022.

&#160;

The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and related statutory guidance encourages the dissemination of science and technology innovation. While our recent contract with HHS BARDA provides us with the right to retain ownership in our inventions that may arise during performance of that contract, with respect to certain other collaborative research efforts with the U.S. government, certain developments and results that may have commercial potential are to be freely published, not treated as confidential, and we may be required to negotiate a license to developments and results in order to commercialize products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such license at a reasonable cost, or that such development and results will not be made available to our competitors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.

&#160;

Trade Secrets. 

&#160;

We also rely significantly on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. It is our policy to require employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. We also require confidentiality agreements from any entity that is to receive confidential information from us. With respect to employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements generally provide that all inventions made by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our property.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

The development, production and marketing of biological products, which included the vaccine candidates being developed by Novavax or our collaborators, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. As a U.S. based company, we focus on the U.S. regulatory process and the standards imposed by the FDA, International Conference on Harmonisation (&#8220;ICH&#8221;) and other agencies because we believe, for the most part, meeting U.S. and ICH standards will allow us to satisfy regulatory agencies in other countries where we intend to do business. We are aware that expectations in some venues, notably in the European Union, differ to some degree and we are taking proactive steps to address such differences. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and biological products are subject to regulation under provisions of that Act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but it also regulates, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA licensure for a new vaccine is costly and time-consuming.

&#160;

Vaccine clinical development follows the same general regulatory pathway as drugs and other biologics. Before applying for FDA licensure to market any new vaccine candidate, we must first submit an investigational new drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) that explains to the FDA, among other things, the results of preclinical toxicology testing conducted in laboratory animals, the method of manufacture, quality control tests for release, the stability of the investigational product and what we propose to do for human testing. At this stage, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the vaccine candidate in humans. We must then conduct Phase 1 clinical trials and larger-scale Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Once these trials are complete, a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) can be submitted to the FDA requesting licensure of the vaccine for marketing based on the vaccine&#8217;s safety and efficacy.

&#160;

During the FDA&#8217;s review of a BLA, the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre-approval inspection during which the FDA examines in detail the production of the vaccine, the manufacturing facility and the quality documentation related to the vaccine. Vaccine licensure also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine&#8217;s proper use, including its potential benefits and risks, to communicate with patients and parents, and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public. Until a vaccine is given to the general population, all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated. Thus, the FDA typically requires Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials for vaccines after licensure to continue gathering safety, and sometimes effectiveness/efficacy data in the indicated and additional populations.

&#160;

In order to ensure continuing safety, the FDA continues to oversee the production of vaccines even after the vaccine and manufacturing processes are approved. For example, monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the product. Manufacturers may also be required to submit to the FDA the results of their own tests for potency, safety and purity for each vaccine lot, if requested by the FDA. They may also be required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to the FDA for testing.

&#160;

In addition to obtaining FDA licensure for each product, each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA, is subject to FDA inspection and must comply with cGMP regulations. To supply products for use either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., including clinical trials, U.S. and foreign manufacturing establishments, including third-party facilities, must comply with GMP regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country.

&#160;

In 1992, the FDA instituted regulations that allow approval of certain products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint, versus a clinical outcome, which can take many more years to demonstrate. Surrogate endpoints, generally a laboratory measurement or other physical sign shown to have some correlation with clinical benefit, can considerably shorten the development time leading up to FDA licensure. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept a proposed surrogate endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. The company developing the product is required to conduct further studies to confirm the clinical benefit in Phase 4 confirmatory efficacy trials. We plan to seek traditional approval for our quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, but have not ruled out the potential use of accelerated approval for specific populations and for our pandemic influenza vaccine candidates.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the U.S., an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed. No such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate marketing application. FDA licensure does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. In addition, in many countries, the government is involved in the pricing of the product. In such cases, the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.

&#160;

We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in Sweden. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.

&#160;

There have been numerous federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, the exertion of government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the U.S. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such healthcare changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

Our primary manufacturing facility is located at our corporate headquarters at 20 Firstfield Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The facility has 53,000 square feet of combined GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space. Our Rockville, Maryland facility houses our 10,000 square foot GMP pilot manufacturing facility that produces early-stage clinical trial material. Novavax AB, located in Uppsala, Sweden, produces our Matrix adjuvants in an approximately 16,000 square foot facility comprised of GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space.

&#160; 

Sources of Supply 

&#160;

Most of the raw materials and other supplies required in our business are generally available from established vendors in quantities adequate to meet our needs. In some cases, we have only qualified one vendor for certain of our manufacturing components. Prior to the initiation of commercial production, we plan, where feasible, to qualify multiple vendors of critical raw materials. One key vendor is GE Healthcare Company (&#8220;GEHC&#8221;), which supplies disposable components, resins, media and buffers used in our manufacturing process. GEHC and other vendors that supply our key manufacturing materials have been or will be audited for compliance with GMP standards.

&#160;

An important component of our Matrix adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree ( Quillaja saponaria ) that grows mainly in Chile, and we have been able to acquire high-quality quillaja extract as needed from our current suppliers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Business Development 

&#160;

We believe our proprietary vaccine technology affords us a range of traditional and non-traditional commercialization options that are broader than those of existing vaccine companies. We strive to create sustainable value by working to obtain non-dilutive funding, similar to our agreements with HHS BARDA and BMGF, to fund future trials in our seasonal and pandemic influenza programs and our RSV program, to continue development of our vaccine candidates until such vaccines can be licensed, to retain commercial rights in one or more major markets and generate product sales revenue and, in certain markets, to commercialize our products through partners and other strategic relationships.

&#160;

In addition to our aforementioned contracts with HHS BARDA and BMGF, another example of our strategic relationships is our joint venture we established with Cadila. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila. It was established in 2009 to develop and manufacture certain vaccine candidates, biogeneric products and diagnostic products for the territory of India. CPLB operates a manufacturing facility in India for the production of vaccines and is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by us.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of February 24, 2016, we have 443 full-time employees, of whom 95 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 109 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 390 are engaged primarily in research, development and manufacturing activities and 53 are engaged primarily in executive, business development, finance and accounting, legal and administrative functions. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements; 32 of our 33 Swedish employees are covered by typical collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
