 Item 1. &#160; Business. 

Organization 

The Company, a Maryland Corporation, is a real estate investment trust engaged in the acquisition, ownership and management of commercial real estate. The Company was organized as an unincorporated business trust (the "Trust") under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 7, 1969. In 1997, the shareholders of the Trust approved a plan of reorganization of the Trust from a Massachusetts business trust to a corporation organized in Maryland. The plan of reorganization was effected by means of a merger of the Trust into the Company. As a result of the plan of reorganization, the Trust was merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of the Trust ceased, the Company was the surviving entity in the merger and each issued and outstanding common share of beneficial interest of the Trust was converted into one share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company.

Tax Status &#8211; Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust 

The Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), beginning with its taxable year ended October 31, 1970. Pursuant to such provisions of the Code, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions regarding the nature of its income and assets will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Although the Company believes that it qualifies as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, no assurance can be given that the Company will continue to qualify as a REIT.

Description of Business 

The Company's sole business is the ownership of real estate investments, which consist principally of investments in income-producing properties, with primary emphasis on properties in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York. The Company's properties consist principally of neighborhood and community shopping centers and seven office buildings. The Company seeks to identify desirable properties for acquisition, which it acquires in the normal course of business. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its portfolio and from time to time may sell certain of its properties.

The Company intends to continue to invest substantially all of its assets in income-producing real estate, with an emphasis on neighborhood and community shopping centers, although the Company will retain the flexibility to invest in other types of real property. While the Company is not limited to any geographic location, the Company's current strategy is to invest primarily in properties located in the northeastern part of the United States with a concentration in the metropolitan New York tri-state area outside of the City of New York.

At October 31, 2015, the Company owned or had equity interests in seventy-four properties comprised of neighborhood and community shopping centers, office buildings, single tenant retail or restaurant properties and office/retail mixed use properties located in four states throughout the United States, containing a total of 4.9 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). For a description of the Company's individual investments, see Item 2 &#8211; Properties.

Investment and Operating Strategy 

The Company's investment objective is to increase the cash flow and the value of its properties. The Company seeks growth through (1) the strategic re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of its existing properties, and (2) the selective acquisition of income-producing properties, primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers, in its targeted geographic region. The Company may also invest in other types of real estate in the targeted geographic region. For a discussion of key elements of the Company's growth strategies and operating policies, see Item 7 &#8211; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Company invests in properties where cost effective renovation and expansion programs, combined with effective leasing and operating strategies, can improve the properties' values and economic returns. Retail properties are typically adaptable for varied tenant layouts and can be reconfigured to accommodate new tenants or the changing space needs of existing tenants. In determining whether to proceed with a renovation or expansion, the Company considers both the cost of such expansion or renovation and the increase in rent attributable to such expansion or renovation. The Company believes that certain of its properties provide opportunities for future renovation and expansion.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, the Company considers such factors as (1) economic, demographic, and regulatory conditions in the property's local and regional market; (2) the location, construction quality, and design of the property; (3) the current and projected cash flow of the property and the potential to increase cash flow; (4) the potential for capital appreciation of the property; (5) the terms of tenant leases, including the relationship between the property's current rents and market rents and the ability to increase rents upon lease rollover; (6) the occupancy and demand by tenants for properties of a similar type in the market area; (7) the potential to complete a strategic renovation, expansion or re-tenanting of the property; (8) the property's current expense structure and the potential to increase operating margins; and (9) competition from comparable properties in the market area.

The Company may from time to time enter into arrangements for the acquisition of properties with unaffiliated property owners through the issuance of units of limited partnership (or units of limited liability company) interests in entities that the Company controls. These units may be redeemable for cash or for shares of the Company's Common stock or Class A Common stock. The Company believes that this acquisition method may permit it to acquire properties from property owners wishing to enter into tax-deferred transactions.

At October 31, 2015, the Company's properties collectively had 868 leases with tenants providing a wide range of products and services. Tenants include regional supermarkets, national and regional discount department stores, other local retailers and office tenants. At October 31, 2015, the sixty-seven consolidated properties were 95.8% leased (see Results of Operations discussion in Item 7). At October 31, 2015, the Company had equity investments in seven properties which it does not consolidate; those properties were 98.1% leased. The Company believes the properties are adequately covered by property and liability insurance.

A substantial portion of the Company's operating lease income is derived from tenants under leases with terms greater than one year. Certain of the leases provide for the payment of monthly fixed base rentals and for the payment by the tenant of a pro-rata share of the real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area maintenance expenses incurred in operating the properties.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015, no single tenant comprised more than 7.7% of the total annual base rents of the Company's properties. The following table sets out a schedule of our ten largest tenants by percent of total annual base rent of our properties as of October 31, 2015.

The Company's single largest real estate investment is its 100% ownership of the general and limited partnership interests in the Ridgeway Shopping Center ("Ridgeway").

Ridgeway is located in Stamford, Connecticut and was developed in the 1950's and redeveloped in the mid 1990's. The property contains approximately 374,000 square feet of GLA. It is the dominant grocery anchored center and the largest non-mall shopping center located in the City of Stamford, Fairfield County, Connecticut. For the year ended October 31, 2015, Ridgeway revenues represented approximately 11.7% of the Company's total revenues and approximately 8.4% of the Company's total assets at October 31, 2015. As of October 31, 2015, Ridgeway was 97.0% leased. The property's largest tenants (by base rent) are: The Stop &#38; Shop Supermarket Company (19%), Bed, Bath &#38; Beyond (14%) and Marshall's Inc., a division of the TJX Companies (11%). No other tenant accounts for more than 10% of Ridgeway's annual base rents.

The following table sets out a schedule of the annual lease expirations for retail leases at Ridgeway as of October 31, 2015 for each of the next ten years and thereafter (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal or cancellation options and that there are no tenant bankruptcies or other tenant defaults):

Non-Core Properties 

In a prior year, the Board of Directors of the Company expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the Company to concentrate the real estate portfolio into one of primarily retail properties located in the Northeast and authorized the sale of the Company's non-core properties in the normal course of business over a period of years given prevailing market conditions and the characteristics of each property.

In December 2013, the Company sold its two non-core properties. The Company reinvested the proceeds into properties in its core marketplace.

Financing Strategy 

The Company intends to continue to finance acquisitions and property improvements and/or expansions with the most advantageous sources of capital which it believes are available to the Company at the time, and which may include the sale of common or preferred equity through public offerings or private placements, the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings, investments in real estate joint ventures and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets. The Company's financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by (1) maintaining a prudent level of leverage, and (2) minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk represented by floating rate debt.

Matters Relating to the Real Estate Business 

The Company is subject to certain business risks arising in connection with owning real estate which include, among others, (1) the bankruptcy or insolvency of, or a downturn in the business of, any of its major tenants, (2) the possibility that such tenants will not renew their leases as they expire, (3) vacated anchor space affecting an entire shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant's customer drawing power or the difficulty in re-leasing that space as a result of co-tenancy lease clauses in other tenants leases, (4) risks relating to leverage, including uncertainty that the Company will be able to refinance its indebtedness, and the risk of higher interest rates, (5) potential liability for unknown or future environmental matters, and (6) the risk of uninsured losses. Unfavorable economic conditions could also result in the inability of tenants in certain retail sectors to meet their lease obligations and otherwise could adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and retain desirable tenants. The Company believes that its shopping centers are relatively well positioned to withstand adverse economic conditions since they typically are anchored by grocery stores, drug stores and discount department stores that offer day-to-day necessities rather than luxury goods. For a discussion of various business risks, see Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations 

The Company, like others in the commercial real estate industry, is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. Although potential liability could exist for unknown or future environmental matters, the Company believes that its tenants are operating in accordance with current laws and regulations.

Competition 

The real estate investment business is highly competitive. The Company competes for real estate investments with investors of all types, including domestic and foreign corporations, financial institutions, other real estate investment trusts, real estate funds, individuals and privately owned companies. In addition, the Company's properties are subject to local competitors from the surrounding areas. The Company's shopping centers compete for tenants with other regional, community or neighborhood shopping centers in the respective areas where the Company's retail properties are located. In addition, the retail industry is seeing greater competition from internet retailers who do not need to establish "brick and mortar" locations for their businesses. This reduces the demand for traditional retail space in shopping centers like ours and other grocery-anchored shopping center properties. The Company's office buildings compete for tenants principally with office buildings throughout the respective areas in which they are located. Leasing decisions are generally determined by prospective tenants on the basis of, among other things, rental rates, location, and physical quality of the property and availability of space.

The Company does not consider its real estate business to be seasonal in nature.

&#160;

&#160;

Property Management 

The Company actively manages and supervises the operations and leasing at all of its properties.

Employees 

The Company's executive offices are located at 321 Railroad Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut. It occupies approximately 10,000 square feet in a two-story office building owned by the Company. The Company has 49 employees and believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

All of the Company's filings with the SEC, including the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge at the Company's website at www.ubproperties.com as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. These filings can also be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller. The Board also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all employees as well as a "Whistleblower Policy". These are available free of charge by contacting the Company.
