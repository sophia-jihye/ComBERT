 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

USA Technologies, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221;, &#8220;USAT&#8221;, or &#8220;Our&#8221;) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in January 1992. We are a provider of technology-enabled solutions and value-added services that facilitate electronic payment transactions primarily within the unattended Point of Sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) market. We are a leading provider in the small ticket, beverage and food vending industry and are expanding our solutions and services to other unattended market segments, such as amusement, commercial laundry, kiosk and others. Since our founding, we have designed and marketed systems and solutions that facilitate electronic payment options, as well as telemetry and machine-to-machine (&#8220;M2M&#8221;) services, which include the ability to remotely monitor, control, and report on the results of distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions. Historically, these distributed assets have relied on cash for payment in the form of coins or bills, whereas, our systems allow them to accept cashless payments such as through the use of credit or debit cards or other emerging contactless forms, such as mobile payment.

&#160;

We derive the majority of our revenues from license and transaction fees resulting from connections to, as well as services provided by, our ePort Connect service. Connections to our service stem from the sale or lease of our POS electronic payment devices or certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals. The majority of ePort Connect customers pay a monthly fee plus a blended transaction rate on the transaction dollar volume processed by the Company. Connections to the ePort Connect service, therefore, are the most significant driver of the Company&#8217;s revenues, particularly revenues from license and transaction fees.

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 429,000 connections to its ePort Connect service, compared to approximately 333,000 connections as of June 30, 2015, representing a 29% increase. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Company processed approximately 316 million cashless transactions totaling approximately $584 million in transaction dollars, representing a 46% increase in transaction volume and a 50% increase in dollars processed from the 217 million cashless transactions totaling approximately $389 million during the previous fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 

The above charts show the increases over the last five fiscal years in the number of connections, revenues and the dollar value of transactions handled by us. The vertical bars depict total revenues, segmented by license and transaction fees and equipment revenues. The solid lines depict the number of connections to our ePort Connect service and the dollar value of transactions handled by us, as of the end of each of the last five fiscal years.

&#160;

Our solutions and services have been designed to simplify the transition to cashless for traditionally cash-only based businesses. As such, they are turn-key and include our comprehensive ePort Connect service and POS electronic payment devices or certified payment software, which are able to process traditional magnetic stripe credit and debit cards, contactless credit and debit cards and mobile payments. Standard services through ePort Connect are maintained on our proprietary operating systems and include merchant account setup on behalf of the customer, automatic processing and settlement, sales reporting and 24x7 customer support. Other value-added services that customers can choose from include things such as cashless deployment planning, cashless performance review and loyalty products and services. Our solutions also provide flexibility to execute a variety of payment applications on a single system, transaction security, connectivity options, compliance with certification standards, and centralized, accurate, real-time sales and inventory data to manage distributed assets (wireless telemetry and M2M). The ePort&#174; Interactive, which was unveiled in April 2016, is a cloud-based interactive media and content delivery management system and enables delivery of nutritional information, remote refunds, loyalty programs, and multimedia-marketing campaigns for the unattended and self-serve retail markets.

&#160;

Our customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate primarily in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets including beverage and food vending, amusement and arcade machines, smartphones via our ePort Online solution, commercial laundry, tolls, and various other self-serve kiosk applications as well as equipment developers or manufacturers who incorporate our ePort Connect service into their product offerings.

&#160;

We believe that we have a history of being a market leader in cashless payments with a recognized brand name, a value-added proposition for our customers and a reputation of innovation in our product and services. We believe that these attributes position us to capitalize on industry trends.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In January 2016, the Company acquired the cloud-based content delivery platform, device platform and products, customer base, and intellectual property of VendScreen, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. In addition to new technology and services, the acquisition has added a West Coast operational footprint for the Company, providing greater efficiencies in operational performance, expanded customer services, sales and technical support to the Company&#8217;s customer base. As a result of the acquisition, the Company has added to its product line an interactive media, content delivery system, including a vending application that provides enhanced vendor management system (VMS) integration and consumer product information, including nutritional data. The technology is NFC enabled and compatible with mobile wallets including Apple Pay and Android Pay, and supports instant refunds, couponing, advertising and real-time consumer feedback to the owner and operator.

&#160;

THE INDUSTRY 

&#160;

We operate primarily in the small ticket electronic payments industry and, more specifically, the unattended POS market. We also have the ability to accept cashless payment &#8220;on the go&#8221; through mobile-based payment services, which are generally higher ticket transactions. Our solutions and services facilitate electronic payments in industries that have traditionally relied on cash transactions. We believe the following industry trends are driving growth in demand for electronic payment systems in general and more specifically within the markets we serve:

&#160;

&#9632; Ongoing shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks; &#160;

&#9632; Increasing demand for electronic transaction functionality from both consumers and merchant/operators; and &#160;

&#9632; Improving POS technology and NFC equipped mobile phone payment technology. &#160;

Shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks 

&#160;

There has been an ongoing shift away from paper-based methods of payment, including cash and checks, towards electronic-based methods of payment. According to The Nilson Report, December 2015, paper-based methods of payment continued to decline in 2014, representing 28.07% of transaction dollars measured compared to 30.61% in 2013. The four card-based systems&#8212;credit, debit, prepaid, and electronic benefits transfer&#8212;generated $5.29 trillion in the United States in 2014, 57.34% of transaction dollars measured, compared to 42.3% in 2006. The Nilson Report projects that, by 2019, spending at merchants in the U.S. from the four card-based systems will grow to 67.03% of total transaction dollars measured.

&#160;

Increase in Consumer and Merchant/Operator Demand for Electronic Payments 

&#160;

Increase in Consumer Demand . The unattended, vending and kiosk POS market has historically been dominated by cash purchases. However, oftentimes, cash purchases at unattended POS locations represent a cumbersome transaction for the consumer because they do not have the correct monetary value (paper or coin), or the consumer does not have the ability to convert their bills into coins. We believe electronic payment system providers such as USA Technologies that can meet consumers&#8217; demand within the unattended market will be able to offer retailers, card associations, card issuers and payment processors and business owners an expanding value proposition at the POS.

&#160;

Increase in Merchant/Operator Demand . We believe that, increasingly, merchants and operators of unattended payment locations (e.g., vending machines, laundry, tabletop games, etc.) are utilizing electronic payment alternatives as a means to improve business results. The Company works with its customers to help them drive increased revenue of their distributed assets through this expanded market opportunity. In addition, electronic payment systems can provide merchants and operators real-time sales and inventory data utilized for back-office reporting and forecasting, like USA Technologies&#8217; solutions and services, helping them to manage their business more efficiently.

&#160;

Increase in Demand for Networked Assets . M2M (machine-to-machine) technology includes capturing value from wireless modules and electronic devices to improve business productivity and customer service. The term M2M describes any kind of 2-way communication system between geographically distributed devices through a centrally managed software application without human intervention and as such, the Company&#8217;s integrated POS and ePort Connect remote data management capabilities fall into this category of solution. In addition, networked assets can provide valuable information regarding consumers&#8217; purchasing patterns and payment preferences, allowing operators to more effectively tailor their offerings to consumers. Gartner, Inc. forecasts that 6.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2016, with 5.5 million new things getting connected every day, and will reach 20.8 billion by 2020. The Company believes that its expertise in integrating cashless payments, its scalable network data capacity, its proven ability to handle high transaction volume, and its high quality and reliable data management capabilities make it well suited for the growing opportunities in the M2M market.

POS Technology and NFC Equipped Mobile Phone Payment Improvements 

&#160;

Consumer Interest in Mobile Payment. &#160; NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a short range wireless connectivity technology that uses electromagnetic radio fields to enable communication between devices when there is a physical touch, or when they are within close proximity to one another. We believe that &#160; POS contactless terminals that are enabled to accept NFC payments and digital wallet applications, such as Google Wallet, Chase Pay, Apple Pay, the recently introduced Android Pay, and others, stand to benefit from these evolving trends in mobile payment. Digital wallet is essentially a digital service, accessed via the web or a mobile phone application that serves as a substitute for the traditional credit or debit card. Providers can also market directly to targeted consumers with coupons and loyalty programs.

&#160;

With over 70% of the Company&#8217;s connections contactless enabled to accept NFC payments (in addition to magnetic stripe cards) as of June 30, 2016, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from this emerging space.

&#160;

OUR TECHNOLOGY-BASED SOLUTION 

&#160;

Our solutions have been designed to be turnkey and include the ePort Connect service, POS electronic payment devices, certified payment software able to process traditional magnetic stripe credit and debit cards, contactless credit and debit cards, and NFC equipped mobile phones that allow consumers to make payments with their cell phones. We believe that our ability to bundle our products and services, as well as the ability to tailor and customize them to individual customer needs, makes it easy and efficient for our customers to adopt and deploy our technology, and results in a service unmatched in the small-ticket, unattended retail market today.

&#160;

The Product . The Company offers its customers several different devices or software to connect their distributed assets. These range from our QuickConnect&#8482; Web service, more fully described below under the section &#8220;OUR PRODUCTS&#8221;, and encrypted magnetic stripe card readers to our ePort &#174; hardware that can be attached to the door of a stand-alone terminal.

&#160;

The Network . Our network is designed to transmit payment information from our customers&#8217; terminals for processing &#160; and sales and diagnostic data for storage and reporting to our customers. Also, the network, through server-based software applications, provides remote management information, and enables control of the networked device&#8217;s functionality. Through our network we have the ability to upload software and update devices remotely enabling us to manage the devices easily and efficiently (e.g., change protocol functionality, provide software upgrades, and change terminal display messages).

&#160;

The Connectivity Mediums. The client devices (described above) are interconnected for the transfer of our customers&#8217; data through our ePort Connect network that provides multiple connectivity options such as phone line, ethernet, and wireless. Increased wireless connectivity options, coverage and reliability have allowed us to service a greater number of geographically dispersed customer locations. Additionally, we make it easy for our customers to deploy wireless solutions by acting as a single point of contact. We have contracted with Verizon Wireless in order to supply our customers with wireless network coverage.

&#160;

Data Security. We are listed on the VISA Global Registry of Service Providers, meaning that VISA has reviewed and accepted the Report on Compliance (RoC) from our authorized Payment Card Industry (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) assessor as a PCI DSS Service Provider. Our entry on this registry is renewed annually, and our current entry is valid through January 31, 2017. The VISA listing can be found online at http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do.

&#160;

OUR SERVICES 

&#160;

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, license and transaction fees generated by our ePort Connect service represented 73% of the Company&#8217;s revenues. Our ePort Connect solution provides customers with all of the following services, under one cohesive service umbrella:

&#160;

&#9679; Diverse POS options. Ability to connect to a broad product line of cashless acceptance devices or software. &#160;

&#9679; Card Processing Services. Through our existing relationships with card processors and card associations, we provide merchant account and terminal ID set up, pre-negotiated discounted fees on small ticket purchases, and direct electronic funds transfers (EFTs) to our customers&#8217; bank accounts for all settled card transactions as well as ensure compliance with current processing guidelines. &#160;

&#9679; Wireless Connectivity. We manage wireless account activations, distributions, and relationships with wireless providers for our customers, if needed. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; Customer/Consumer Services. We support our installed base by providing 24-hour help desk support, repairs, and replacement of impaired system solutions. In addition, all inbound billing inquiries are handled through a 24-hour help desk, thereby eliminating the need for our customers to deal with consumer billing inquiries and potential chargebacks. &#160;

&#9679; Online Sales Reporting. Via the USALive online reporting system, we provide customers with a host of sales and operational data, including information regarding their credit and cash transactions, user configuration, reporting by machine and region, by date range and transaction type, data reports for operations and finance, graphical reporting of sales, and condition monitoring for equipment service, as well as activation of new devices and redeployments. &#160;

&#9679; M2M Telemetry and DEX data transfer. DEX, an acronym for digital exchange, is the Vending Industry&#8217;s standard way to communicate information such as sales, cash in bill validators, coins in coin boxes, sales of units by selection, pricing, door openings, and much more. USA Technologies is able to remotely transfer and push DEX data to customers&#8217; route management systems through its DEX partner program. USA Technologies operates within the VDI (Vending Data Interchange) standards established by NAMA (National Automatic Merchandising Association) and sends DEX files compatible with most major remote management software systems. &#160;

&#9679; Over-the-Air Update Capabilities. Automatic over-the-air updates to software, settings, and features from our network to our ePort card reader keep our customers&#8217; hardware up-to-date and enable customers to benefit from any advancement made after their hardware or software purchase. &#160;

&#9679; Value-added Services. Access to additional services such as MORE , our loyalty program, two-tier pricing, special promotions such as our nationwide Apple Pay mobile payment for vending customers, as well as a menu of hardware purchasing options including JumpStart, our terminal-included service option and hardware leasing options through third parties. &#160;

&#9679; Deployment Planning. Access to services to help operators successfully deploy cashless payment systems and integrated solutions that is based on our extensive market and customer experience data. &#160;

&#9679; Premium Services. USAT offers Premium Services to support our customers that fully leverages the Company&#8217;s industry expertise and access to data. These services include planning, project management, installation support, marketing and performance evaluation. &#160;

We enter into an ePort Connect Services Agreement, our processing and licensing agreement, with our customers pursuant to which we act as a provider of cashless financial services for the customer&#8217;s distributed assets, and the customer agrees to pay us an activation fee, monthly service fees, and transaction processing fees. Our agreements are generally cancelable by the customer upon thirty to sixty days&#8217; notice to us from the time of shipment. It typically takes thirty to sixty days for a new connection to begin contributing to the Company&#8217;s license and transaction fee revenues.

&#160;

The Company counts its ePort connections upon shipment of an active terminal to a customer under contract, at which time activation on its network is performed by the Company, and the terminal is capable of conducting business via the Company&#8217;s network and related services. An ePort connection does not necessarily mean that the unit is actually installed by the customer on a machine, or that the unit has begun processing transactions, or that the Company has begun receiving monthly service fees in connection with the unit. Rather, at the time of shipment of the ePort, the customer becomes obligated to pay the one-time activation fee (if applicable), and is obligated to pay monthly service fees and lease payments (if applicable) in accordance with the terms of the customer&#8217;s contract with the Company.

&#160;

OUR PRODUCTS 

&#160;

ePort is the Company&#8217;s core device, which is currently being utilized in self-service, unattended markets such as vending, amusement and arcade, and various other kiosk applications. Our ePort product facilitates cashless payments by capturing payment information and transmitting it to our network for authorization with the payment system (e.g., credit card processors). Additional capabilities of our ePort consist of control/access management by authorized users, collection of audit information (e.g., date and time of sale and sales amount), diagnostic information of the host equipment, and transmission of this data back to our network for web-based reporting, or to a compatible remote management system. Our ePort products are available in several distinctive modular configurations, and as hardware, software or as an API Web service, offering our customers flexibility to install a POS solution that best fits their needs and consumer demands.

&#160;

&#9679; ePort Edge&#8482; is a one-piece design and is intended for those customers who require a magnetic swipe-only cashless system with basic features at a lower price point. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; ePort G-8 is a two-piece design that supports traditional magnetic stripe credit/debit cards and contactless cards. The ePort G8 telemeter is also available as a stand-alone DEX telemetry solution. &#9679; ePort G-9 has been designed to offer all the features of the G-8 plus additional new features that support expanded acceptance options, consumer engagement offerings and advanced diagnostics. &#9679; ePort Interactive is a cloud-based interactive media and content delivery management system, enabling delivery of nutritional information, remote refunds, loyalty programs, and multimedia-marketing for the unattended and self-serve retail markets. &#9679; QuickConnect is a Web service that allows a client application to securely interface with the Company&#8217;s ePort Connect service. QuickConnect essentially replaces ePort SDK (software development kit), which captured our ePort technology in software form for PC-based devices such as kiosks. &#160;

Other forms of our ePort technology include:

&#160;

&#9679; eSuds, our solution developed for the commercial laundry industry that enables laundry operators to provide customers cashless transactions via the use of their credit cards, debit cards and other payment mediums such as student IDs. Effective with the April 2013 mutually exclusive agreement with Setomatic Systems, we are no longer selling the entire eSuds solution to new customers, but we continue to provide processing services for laundry machines equipped with cashless hardware supplied by Setomatic Systems. &#9679; ePort Online, enables customers to use USALive to securely process cards typically held on on file for the purpose of online billing and recurring charges. ePort Online Online helps USAT&#8217;s customers reduce paper invoicing and collections. &#160; 

SPECIFIC MARKETS WE SERVE 

&#160;

Our current customers are primarily in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets including beverage and food vending and kiosk, commercial laundry, car wash, tolls, amusement and gaming, and office coffee. While these industry sectors represent only a small fraction of our total market potential, as described below, these are the areas where we have gained the most traction to date. In addition to being our current primary markets, we believe these sectors serve as a proof-of-concept for other unattended POS industry applications.

&#160;

Vending. According to Vending Times&#8217; 2014 Census of the Industry, annual U.S. sales in the vending industry sector were estimated to be approximately $43 billion in 2013 transacted by approximately 4.5 million machines. The Company believes these machines represent a significant market opportunity for electronic payment conversion when compared to the Company&#8217;s existing ePort Connect service base and the overall low rate of industry adoption to date. For example, in another study conducted by Automatic Merchandiser (State of the Vending Industry, June 2015) that included a representative 5.1 million machines, cashless adoption was estimated at only 11% in 2014, up from 7% in 2012. With the continued shift to electronic payments and the advancement in mobile and POS technology, we believe that the traditional beverage and food vending industry will continue to look to cashless payments and telemetry systems to improve their business results.

&#160;

Kiosk . According to IHL Consulting Group&#8217;s August 2012 North American Self-Service Kiosks Market Study, which defines, for purposes of their study, a kiosk as a self-standing, technology-based, unmanned device deployed across six retail and hospitality environments, approximately $926 billion was going to be transacted through self-service kiosks in 2013, with compound annual growth for the subsequent three years of seven percent (7%). We believe that kiosks are becoming increasingly popular as credit, debit or contactless payment options enable kiosks to sell an increased variety of items. In addition, the study points to the increasing trend toward self-sufficiency, where time is the most important commodity of the consumer. As merchants continue to seek new ways to reach their customers through kiosk applications, we believe the need for a reliable cashless payment provider experienced with machine integration, PCI compliance and cashless payment services designed specifically for the unattended market will be of increasing value in this market. Our existing kiosk customers integrate with our cashless payment services via our QuickConnect Web service using one of our encrypted readers or ePort POS technologies.

&#160;

Laundry . Our primary targets in laundry consist of the coin-operated commercial laundry and multi-housing laundry markets. According to the Coin Laundry Association, the U.S. commercial laundry industry was comprised of about 35,000 coin laundries in the U.S. in 2015 that our partner, Setomatic Systems, estimated translates to roughly 2.5 million commercial washers and dryers. The Coin Laundry Association estimated gross annual revenue in the laundromat market at nearly $5 billion annually.

&#160;

Mobile Merchant. New mobile-based payment acceptance technology has made a transformational impact on an entire base of merchants that previously had almost no access to electronic-based payments. Goldman Sachs (Equity Research Report, June 19, 2012) sees the arrival of mobile technology at the micro/small merchant level addressing an estimated 13 million U.S.-based micro merchants that are likely to benefit from the ability to accept electronic payment from mobile devices. The Company believes that its mobile-based acceptance product and existing turnkey service platform align well with the market&#8217;s need for integrated, mobile payment solutions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

&#160;

We believe that we benefit from a number of advantages gained through our nearly twenty-five year history in our industry. They include:

&#160;

1. One-Stop Shop, End-to-End Solution. We believe that our ability to offer our customers one point of contact through a bundled cashless payment solution makes it easy and efficient for our customers to adopt and deploy our electronic payment solutions and results in a service that is unmatched in the small ticket, self-service retail market today. To our knowledge, other cashless payment solutions available in the market today require the operator to set up their own accounts for cashless processing and manage multiple service providers (i.e., hardware terminal manufacturer, wireless network provider, and/or credit card processor). We interface directly with our card processor and wireless service provider, and, with our hardware solutions, are able to offer a bundled solution to our customers. &#160;

2. Trusted Brand Name. We believe that the ePort has a strong national reputation for quality, reliability, and innovation. We believe that card associations, payment processors, and merchants/operators trust our system solutions and services to handle financial transactions in a secure operating environment. Our trusted brand name is best exemplified by our high level of customer retention, numerous exclusive three-year agreements with customers for use of our ePort Connect service. We have agreements with partners like Visa, MasterCard, Chase Paymentech and Verizon Wireless as well as several one-way exclusive relationships which we have solidified with leading organizations within the unattended POS industry, including Setomatic Systems, AMI Entertainment Network, Inc., Innovative Foto, and Air-Serv. &#160;

3. Market Leadership. We believe we have the largest installed based of Unattended POS electronic payment systems in the unattended small ticket retail market for food and beverage and we are continuing to expand to other adjacent markets such as laundry, amusement, and gaming and kiosks. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 429,000 connections to our network. Our installed base supports our sales and marketing initiatives by enhancing our ability to establish or expand our market position. In addition, this data in combination with our industry experts and analysis enables us to offer Premium Services to our customers to help them deploy and better leverage our technology in their locations. We believe our installed base also provides multiple opportunities for referrals for new business, either from the merchant or operator of the deployed asset or through one of our several strategic partnerships. &#160;

4. Attractive Value Proposition for Our Customers . We believe that our solutions provide our customers an attractive value proposition. Our solutions and services make possible increased purchases by consumers who in the past were limited to the physical cash on hand while making a purchase at an unattended terminal, thereby increasing the universe of potential customers and the size of the purchases of those customers. In addition, value-added offerings and services such as Two-Tier Pricing, which allows the operator to charge different amounts for the same product depending upon whether the consumer chooses to pay by cash or credit/debit, and M2M telemetry provide operators with the ability to pursue additional opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies. Lastly, new consumer engagement services further extend the potential for customers to build new revenue opportunities, customer loyalty and brand distinction. One of such services is provided through the ePort Interactive platform, our cloud-based interactive media and content delivery management system, which enables delivery of nutritional information, remote refunds, loyalty programs, and multimedia-marketing campaigns for the unattended and self-serve retail markets. &#160;

5. Increasing Scale and Financial Stability. Due to the continued growth in connections to the Company&#8217;s ePort Connect service, during the 2016 fiscal year, 73% of the Company&#8217;s revenues were from licensing and processing fees which are recurring in nature. We believe that this growing scale provides us improved financial stability and the footprint to market and distribute our products and services more effectively and in more markets than most of our competitors. &#160;

6. Customer-Focused Research and Development. Our research and development initiatives focus primarily on adding features and functionality to our electronic payment solutions based on customer input and emerging market trends. As of June 30, 2016, we had 78 patents (US and International) in force, and 4 United States and 7 international patent applications pending. We have generated considerable intellectual property and know-how associated with creating a seamless, end-to-end experience for our customers. &#160;

OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY 

&#160;

Our primary objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of technology that enables electronic payment transactions and value-added services primarily at small-ticket, self-service retail locations such as vending, kiosks, commercial laundry, and other similar markets. The Company believes its service-approach business model can create a high-margin stream of recurring revenues that could create a foundation for long-term value and continued growth. Key elements of our strategy are to:

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Drive Growth in Connections 

&#160;

Leverage Existing Customers/Partners. We have a solid base of key customers across multiple markets, particularly in vending, that have currently deployed our solutions and services to just a small portion of their deployed base. As a result, they are a key component of our plan to drive future sales. We have worked to build these relationships, drive future deployments, and develop customized network interfaces. Our customers have seen the benefits of our products and services first-hand and we believe they represent the largest opportunity to scale connections to our service.

&#160;

Expand Distribution and Sales Reach. We are intently focused on driving profitable growth through efficient sales channels. Our sales resources and new distribution relationships have led to approximately 1,450 new ePort Connect customers as well as increased penetration in markets such as amusement and arcade, and commercial laundry in fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

Further Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We plan to continue to introduce our turnkey solutions and services to various adjacent markets such as the broad-based kiosk market and other similar markets by leveraging our expertise in cashless payment integration combined with the capacity and uniqueness of our ePort Connect solution.

&#160;

Capitalize on Opportunities in International Markets . We are currently focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets for our ePort devices and related ePort Connect service but may seek to establish a presence in electronic payment markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In order to do so, however, we would have to invest in additional sales and marketing and research and development resources targeted towards these regions. At this time, the Company believes the most efficient route to these markets will be achieved by optimizing and coordinating opportunities with its global partners and customers. Our energy management devices have been shipped to customers located in North America, Europe, and Asia.

&#160;

Expanding the Value of our Service 

&#160;

Capitalize on the emerging NFC and growing mobile payments trends. With approximately 78% of our connected base contactless enabled to accept NFC payments (including mobile wallets), the Company believes that continued increases in consumer preferences towards contactless payments, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay, represent a significant opportunity for the Company to further drive adoption. According to a market research study conducted in June 2015, almost one in six US consumers (15%) had used a mobile wallet in the past six months, up from 9% in the same period in 2013, and an additional 22% are likely to adopt mobile wallet functionality in the coming six months (The Future of the Mobile Wallet - Chadwick Martin Bailey ). As consumers continue to adopt these new methods of cashless payments, it is our belief that adoption will continue to accelerate at a rapid pace and result in more rapid adoption of cashless solutions like USA Technologies&#8217; ePort in the markets that we serve.

&#160;

Continuous Innovation. We are continuously enhancing our solutions and services in order to satisfy our customers and the end-consumers relying on our products at the POS locations. Our product innovation team is always working to enhance the design, size, and speed of data transmission, as well as security and compatibility with other electronic payment solution providers&#8217; technologies. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of USAT&#8217;s solutions and services in the unattended POS payments market.

&#160;

Comprehensive Service and Support. In addition to its industry-leading ePort cashless payments system, USA Technologies seeks to provide its customers with a comprehensive, value-added ePort Connect service that is designed to encourage optimal ROI through business planning and performance optimization; business metrics through the Company&#8217;s KnowledgeBase of data; a loyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; marketing strategy and executional support; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend cashless payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operator&#8217;s business including micro-markets contract food industry, online payments and mobile payments.

&#160;

Leverage Intellectual Property .

IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS 

&#160;

Verizon Wireless 

&#160;

In April 2011, we signed an agreement with Verizon for access to their digital wireless wide area network for the transport of data, including credit card transactions and inventory management data. The initial term of the agreement was three years, which was extended until April 2016. At the end of the term, the agreement automatically renews for successive one month periods unless terminated by either party upon thirty days&#8217; notice.

The Company and Verizon would collaborate on marketing and communications materials that would be used by each of them to educate and inform customers regarding their joint marketing work. Verizon has the right to list the Company&#8217;s products and services in its Data Solutions Guide for use by its sales and marketing employees and in its external website.

&#160;

On August 22, 2011, we entered into an exclusive three-year agreement with AMI Entertainment (&#8220;AMI&#8221;) as their exclusive processor of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments in connection with equipment operated on AMI&#8217;s network in the U.S. and Canada. The agreement is subject to renewal for one-year periods thereafter, subject to notice of non-renewal by either party. The agreement renewed for one year in August 2016. AMI manufactures various types of amusement, entertainment and music equipment for sale to third party users.

&#160;

Setomatic Systems 

&#160;

In April 2013, we entered into an three-year exclusive agreement with Setomatic Systems (&#8220;Setomatic&#8221;), a privately owned and operated developer and manufacturer of both open and closed loop card payment systems, drop coin meters and electronic timers for the commercial laundry industry. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company, through our ePort Connect&#174; service, will act as the exclusive service provider for all credit/debit card processing for all new customers of Setomatic&#8217;s SpyderWash, a credit/debit card acceptance product. Similarly, the Company will market its ePort Connect service in the United States laundry market exclusively through Setomatic. The agreement is subject to renewal for one- year periods after the initial three-year term, subject to notice of non-renewal by either party.

&#160;

QUICK START PROGRAM 

&#160;

In order to reduce customers&#8217; upfront capital costs associated with the ePort hardware, the Company makes available to its customers the Quick Start program, pursuant to which the customer would enter into a five-year non-cancelable lease with either the Company or a third-party leasing company for the devices. At the end of the lease period, the customer would have the option to purchase the device for a nominal fee.

&#160;

From its introduction in September 2014 and through approximately mid-March 2015, the Company entered into these leases directly with its customers. In the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, however, the Company signed vendor agreements with two leasing companies, whereby our customers could enter into leases directly with the leasing companies.

&#160;

There has been a shift by our customers from acquiring our product via JumpStart, which accounted for 11% of our gross connections in fiscal year 2015, and for 9% of our gross connections in fiscal year 2016, to QuickStart or a straight purchase, which accounted for approximately 91% of gross connections in fiscal year 2016. The shift to a straight purchase, along with our ability to increase cash collections under QuickStart sales by utilizing leasing companies, has improved cash provided by operating activities.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Due to the success of the QuickStart program as measured by customer utilization of the program and the positive impact on the Company&#8217;s cash flows from operating activities when a leasing company is utilized, the Company intends to expand this program by entering into additional vendor agreements with leasing companies and/or expanding its relationship with the two incumbent leasing companies.

&#160;

JUMP START PROGRAM 

&#160;

Pursuant to the JumpStart Program, customers acquire the ePort cashless device at no upfront cost by paying a higher monthly service fee, avoiding the need to make a major upfront capital investment. The Company would continue to own the ePort device utilized by its customer. At the time of the shipment of the ePort device, the customer is obligated to pay to the Company a one-time activation fee, and is later obligated to pay monthly ePort Connect service fees in accordance with the terms of the customer&#8217;s contract with the Company, in addition to transaction processing fees generated from the device. In fiscal year 2016, the Company added approximately 9% of its gross connections through JumpStart.

&#160;

MANUFACTURING 

&#160;

The Company utilizes independent third party companies for the manufacturing of its products. Our internal manufacturing process mainly consists of quality assurance of materials and testing of finished goods received from our contract manufacturers. We have not entered into a long-term contract with our contract manufacturers, nor have we agreed to commit to purchase certain quantities of materials or finished goods from our manufacturers beyond those submitted under routine purchase orders, typically covering short-term forecasts.

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160;

We are a leading provider of cashless payments systems for the small-ticket, unattended market and believe we have the largest installed base of unattended POS electronic payment systems in the beverage and food vending industry. Factors that we consider to be our competitive advantages are described above under &#8220;OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS.&#8221; Our competitors are increasingly and actively marketing products and services that compete with our products and services in the vending space including manufacturers who may include in their new vending machines their own (or another third party&#8217;s) cashless payment systems and services. These major competitors include Crane Payment Innovations and Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. While we believe our products and services are superior to our competitors&#8217;, many of our competitors are much larger enterprises and have substantially greater revenues. In addition to these competitors, there are also numerous credit card processors that offer card processing services to traditional retail establishments that could decide to offer similar services to the industries that we serve.

&#160;

In the cashless laundry market, our joint solution with Setomatic Systems competes with hardware manufacturers, who provide joint solutions to their customers in partnership with payment processors, and with at least one competitor who provides an integrated hardware and payment processing solution.
