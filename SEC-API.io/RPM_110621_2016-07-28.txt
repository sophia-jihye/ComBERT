Available Information

Our Internet website address is www.rpminc.com. We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Segment Information

Our business is divided into three reportable segments: the industrial reportable segment (&#8220;industrial segment&#8221;), the specialty reportable segment (&#8220;specialty segment&#8221;) and the consumer reportable segment (&#8220;consumer segment&#8221;). Within each reportable segment, we aggregate several operating segments which comprise individual reporting units and product lines that generally address common markets, utilize similar technologies and are able to share manufacturing or distribution capabilities. The industrial segment (Tremco Group, tremco illbruck Group, and RPM Performance Coatings Group), which comprises approximately 51% of our total net sales, includes maintenance and protection products for roofing and waterproofing systems, flooring, passive fire protection, corrosion control and other construction chemicals. The specialty segment (Specialty Products Group) comprises approximately 15% of our total net sales, and includes industrial cleaners, restoration services equipment, colorants, exterior finishes, edible coatings and other specialty original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) coatings. The consumer segment (Rust-Oleum Group, DAP Group and SPG-Consumer Group) comprises approximately 34% of our total net sales and includes rust-preventative, special purpose and decorative paints, caulks, sealants, primers, nail enamels, cement and woodcare coatings and other branded consumer products. See Note O, &#8220;Segment Information,&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in the 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by reference, for financial information relating to our three reportable segments and financial information by geographic area.

&#160;

&#160;

On May 31, 2010, Bondex International, Inc. and its parent, SPHC, voluntarily filed Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. SPHC is our wholly owned subsidiary. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 810, when a subsidiary becomes subject to the control of a government, court, administrator, or regulator, deconsolidation of that subsidiary is generally required. We had therefore deconsolidated SPHC and its subsidiaries from our balance sheet as of May 31, 2010, and had eliminated the results of SPHC&#8217;s operations from our results of operations beginning on that date. Effective as of December 23, 2014, the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware and the United States District Court in Delaware confirmed t he Bankruptcy Plan for SPHC and related entities and these entities emerged from bankruptcy. Accordingly, financial results of SPHC&#8217;s operating subsidiaries, which had not been included in our financial reports since the bankruptcy filing, have been recons olidated with our results as of January 1, 2015, and are included in our results from that point forward.

We have manufacturing facilities in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. We also have sales offices or warehouse facilities in Austria, The Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, Vietnam and several other countries. Information concerning our foreign operations is set forth in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition, which appears in the 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We conduct our business in highly competitive markets, and all of our major products face competition from local, regional, national and multi-national firms. Our markets, however, are fragmented, and we do not face competition across all of our products from any one competitor in particular. Several of our competitors have access to greater financial resources and larger sales organizations than we do. While third-party figures are not necessarily available with respect to the size of our position in the market for each of our products, we believe that we are a major producer of caulks, sealants, patch-and-repair products for the general consumer as well as for the residential building trade; roofing systems; urethane sealants and waterproofing materials; aluminum coatings; cement-based coatings; hobby paints; small project paints; industrial-corrosion-control products; fireproofing; consumer rust-preventative coatings; polymer floorings; fluorescent coatings and pigments; fiberglass-reinforced-plastic gratings; nail polish; water and fire damage restoration products; carpet cleaning systems and shellac-based coatings. However, we do not believe that we have a significant share of the total protective coatings market (on a world-wide basis). The following is a summary of the competition that our key products face in the various markets in which we compete:

Paints, Coatings, Adhesives and Sealants Products 

The market for paints, coatings, adhesives and sealants has experienced significant consolidation over the past several decades. However, the market remains fragmented, which creates further consolidation opportunities for industry participants. Many leading suppliers tend to focus on coatings, while other companies focus on adhesives and sealants. Barriers to market entry are relatively high for new market entrants due to the lengthy intervals between product development and market acceptance, the importance of brand identity and the difficulty in establishing a reputation as a reliable supplier of these products. Most of the suppliers, including us, who provide these items have a portfolio of products that span across a wide variety of applications.

&#160;

&#160;

Consumer Home Improvement Products. Within the consumer segment, we generally serve the home improvement market with products designed for niche architectural, rust-preventative, decorative and special purpose paint and caulking and sealing applications. The products we sell for home improvement include those sold under our DAP, Phenoseal, Rust-Oleum, Watco and Zinsser brand names. Leading manufacturers of home improvement-related coatings, adhesives and sealants market their products to DIY users and contractors through a wide range of distribution channels. These distribution channels include direct sales to home improvement centers, mass merchandisers, hardware and paint stores, and sales through distributors and sales representative organ izations. Competitors in this market generally compete for market share by marketing and building upon brand recognition, providing customer service and developing new products based on customer needs. 

Industrial Protective Coatings Products. Anti-corrosion protective coatings and fireproofing must withstand the destructive elements of nature and operating processes under harsh environments and conditions. Some of the larger consumers of high-performance protective and corrosion control coatings and fireproofing are the oil and gas, pulp and paper, petrochemical, shipbuilding, public utility and bridge and highway industries. In the public sector, corrosion control coatings are used on structures such as bridges and in water and wastewater treatment plants. These markets are highly fragmented. We and our competitors compete for market share by supplying a wide variety of high-quality products and by offering customized solutions. Our protective industrial coating products are marketed primarily under our Carboline, Plasite, Nullifire, A/D Fire, Thermo-lag, Perlifoc and Epoplex brand names. 

Roofing Systems Products 

In the roofing industry, re-roofing applications have historically accounted for three-quarters of U.S. demand, with the remaining quarter generated by new roofing applications. The largest manufacturers of roofing systems products focus primarily on residential roofing as well as single-ply systems for low-end, commercial and institutional applications, competing mainly on price and, to a lesser degree, service. In contrast, we compete primarily for the higher-end, multi-ply and modified bitumen applications in the built-up and low-slope roofing industry. This specialty niche within the larger market tends to exhibit fewer commodity-market characteristics, with customers valuing the greater protection and longer life provided by these roofing systems, as well as ongoing maintenance, inspection and technical services. Our roofing systems are primarily marketed under our Tremco and Viapol brands. Historically, our typical roofing systems customers have included governmental facilities, universities, schools, hospitals, museums and certain manufacturing facilities. However, we are also very active in the growing market of sustainable roofing systems, and our Tremco Roofing fluid applied and restoration coating systems represent our fastest growing product segment. Our restoration systems meet sustainable objectives including energy efficiency through reflectivity and emissivity, and eliminate environmentally and economically costly landfill waste.

Construction Chemical Products 

Flooring Systems Products. Polymer flooring systems are used in industrial, commercial and, to a lesser extent, residential applications to provide a smooth, seamless surface that is impervious to penetration by water and other substances while being easy to clean and maintain. These systems are particularly well-suited for clean environments such as pharmaceutical, food and beverage and healthcare facilities. In addition, the fast installation time and long-term durability of these systems and products make them ideal for industrial floor repair and restoration. Polymer flooring systems are based on epoxy, polyurethane and methylmethacrylate resins. Most of these flooring systems are applied during new construction, but there is also a significant repair and renovation market. Key performance attributes in polymer flooring systems that distinguish competitors for these applications include static control, chemical resistance, contamination control, durability and aesthetics. We market our flooring systems under the Stonhard, Flowcrete, Expanko, Fritztile, Hummervoll and API brand names. 

FRP Grating and Structural Composites. Fiberglass reinforced plastic grating, or FRP, is used primarily in industrial and, to a lesser extent, commercial applications. FRP grating exhibits many specialized features, which make it a beneficial alternative to traditional steel or aluminum grating. These include a high strength-to-weight ratio, high corrosion resistance, electrical and thermal non-conductivity, and molded-in color, which eliminates the need for repainting. FRP grating is used for platforms, walkways, stairs and structures for a variety of applications, including those in the food and beverage, chemical processing, water-wastewater, pulp and paper, and offshore oil and gas industries. Other structural composites include trench drains, channel drains, curbing and structural members. Key attributes that differentiate competitors in these markets include product quality, depth of product line, and design-and-fabrication services. Our products for these applications are sold under our Fibergrate, Chemgrate, Corgrate, Safe-T-Span, EnviroKerb, EnviroChannel, EnviroDeck and EnviroGrate brand names. 

&#160;

&#160;

Sealants, Waterproofing, Concrete and Masonry Products. Sealants, which are used primarily for commercial buildings, include urethane, silicone, latex, butyl and hybrid technology products, and are designed to be installed in construction joints for the purpose of providing an air and water-tight seal. Waterproof coatings, usually urethane or asphalt based, are installed in exposed and buried applications to waterproof and protect concrete. Structural and traffic bearing membranes are used in a varie ty of applications for bridge deck construction and restoration and the protection and preservation of balconies, pedestrian walkways and parking structures. In the concrete and masonry additives market, a variety of chemicals and fibers can be added to c oncrete and masonry to improve the processability, performance, or appearance of these products. Chemical admixtures for concrete are typically grouped according to their functional characteristics, such as water-reducers, set controllers, superplasticizer s and air-entraining agents. Curing and sealing compounds, structural grouts, epoxy adhesives, floor hardeners and toppings, joint fillers, industrial and architectural coatings, decorative color/stains/stamps, and a comprehensive selection of restoration materials are used to protect, repair or improve new or existing concrete structures used in the construction industry. The key attributes that differentiate competitors for these applications include quality assurance, on-the-job consultation and value-ad ded, highly engineered products. We primarily offer products marketed under our Tremco, EUCO, Toxement, Viapol, Betumat, CAVE, illbruck, Tamms, AlphaGuard, PowerPly, TremPly, TremLock, Vulkem, TREMproof, Dymonic, Increte, TUFF-N-DRI, Nufins, StructureCare, BridgeCare, Pitchmastic, Watchdog Waterproofing, PSI, Tuf-Strand and Enviro-Dri brand names for this line of business.

Our intellectual property portfolios include valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks, trade and brand names. In addition, through our subsidiaries, we continue to conduct significant research and technology development activities. Among our most significant intangibles are our Rust-Oleum &#174; , Carboline &#174; , DAP &#174; , illbruck &#174; and Tremco &#174; trademarks.

&#160;

&#160;

Raw M aterials 

The sources and availability of the raw materials we use in our business continue to be adequate to meet our current and projected needs. While certain oil-based raw material costs have eased over the past 12 months, our material costs can experience significant (and usually volatile) cost changes due to changes in global demand, unusually high planned and unplanned raw material production shutdowns, certain changes in global crop yields, certain changing feedstock costs, foreign exchange effects, supplier consolidation and related pricing discipline, and decreased natural gas costs relative to the cost of oil, which has caused a reduction in the supply of certain materials. In particular, foreign exchange has had a significant impact recently upon the costs of sales, since several of our foreign operations pay their suppliers in U.S. dollars, which has strengthened recently against many other foreign currencies. On a long-term basis, we anticipate the costs of the raw materials we use will continue to be subject to upward pressure.

Seasonal Factors

Our business is dependent, to a significant extent, on external weather factors. We historically experience stronger sales and net income in our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters, which are the three month periods ending August 31, November 30 and May 31, respectively, while we have experienced weaker performance in our third fiscal quarter.

Customers

Ten large consumer segment customers, such as DIY home centers, on a combined basis represented approximately 23%, 23% and 24% of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Except for sales to these customers, our business is not dependent upon any one customer or small group of customers, but is largely dispersed over a substantial number of customers.

Backlog

We historically have not had a significant backlog of orders, and we did not have a significant backlog at May 31, 2016.

Research and Development

Our research and development work is performed at various laboratory locations. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately $61.5 million, $56.7 million and $54.6 million, respectively, was charged to expense for research and development activities. In addition to this laboratory work, we view our field technical service as being integral to the success of our research activities. Our research and development activities and our field technical service costs are both included as part of our selling, general and administrative expenses.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations dealing with environmental, health and safety issues for the various locations around the world in which we conduct our business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following major areas:

&#160;

&#183; 

the sale, export, generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, water and air; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the health and safety of our employees. 

For information regarding environmental accruals, see Note N, &#8220;Contingencies and Other Accrued Losses,&#8221; of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in the 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, and is incorporated herein by reference. For more information concerning certain environmental matters affecting us, see &#8220;Item 3 &#8212; Legal Proceedings &#8212; Environmental Proceedings&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees

As of May 31, 2016, we employed 13,394 persons, of whom approximately 897 were represented by unions under contracts which expire at varying times in the future. We believe that all relations with employees and their unions are good.
