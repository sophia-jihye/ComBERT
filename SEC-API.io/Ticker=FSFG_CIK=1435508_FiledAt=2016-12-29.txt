 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160;

General 

&#160; 

First Savings Financial Group, Inc., an Indiana corporation, was incorporated in May 2008 to serve as the holding company for First Savings Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221; or &#8220;First Savings Bank&#8221;). On October 6, 2008, in accordance with a Plan of Conversion adopted by its Board of Directors and approved by its members, the Bank converted from a mutual savings bank to a stock savings bank and became the wholly-owned subsidiary of First Savings Financial Group. In connection with the conversion, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,542,042 shares of common stock at an offering price of $10.00 per share. In addition, in connection with the conversion, First Savings Charitable Foundation was formed, to which the Company contributed 110,000 shares of common stock and $100,000 in cash. The Company&#8217;s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on October 7, 2008 under the symbol &#8220;FSFG&#8221;.

&#160;

In accordance with a Plan of Charter Conversion adopted by the Board of Directors of First Savings Bank on May 21, 2014, First Savings Bank converted from a federally-chartered savings bank to an Indiana-chartered commercial bank and became a member the Federal Reserve System effective December 19, 2014. As a result of the Bank&#8217;s charter conversion, First Savings Financial Group converted to a bank holding company and simultaneously elected financial holding company status effective December 19, 2014. See Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning of page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding the charter conversions.

&#160;

First Savings Financial Group&#8217;s principal business activity is the ownership of the outstanding common stock of First Savings Bank. First Savings Financial Group does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of First Savings Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. Accordingly, the information set forth in this annual report including the consolidated financial statements and related financial data contained herein, relates primarily to the Bank.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

First Savings Bank operates as a community-oriented financial institution offering traditional financial services to consumers and businesses in its primary market area. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate primarily residential and commercial mortgage loans. We also originate commercial business loans, residential and commercial construction loans, multi-family loans, land and land development loans, and consumer loans. We conduct our lending and deposit activities primarily with individuals and small businesses in our primary market area, except as otherwise discussed herein.

&#160;

On July 6, 2012, First Savings Bank acquired the four Indiana branches of First Federal Savings Bank of Elizabethtown, Inc. (&#8220;First Federal&#8221;), a Kentucky-chartered commercial bank, two of which were consolidated into the existing operations of First Savings Bank immediately subsequent to the acquisition. The acquisition enhanced First Savings Bank&#8217;s presence in Harrison and Floyd Counties in Indiana.

&#160;

Market Area

&#160; 

We are located in South Central Indiana along the axis of Interstate 65 and Interstate 64, directly across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. We consider Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford and Washington counties, Indiana, in which all of our offices are located, and the surrounding areas to be our primary market area. The current top employment sectors in these counties are the private retail, service and manufacturing industries, which are likely to continue to be supported by the projected growth in population and median household income. These counties are well-served by barge transportation, rail service, and commercial and general aviation services, including the United Parcel Service&#8217;s major hub, which are located in our primary market area.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities and mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors&#8217; funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2016, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), we held approximately 12.17%, 2.78%, 34.48%, 81.84% and 10.86% of the FDIC-insured deposits in Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford and Washington Counties, Indiana, respectively. This data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions with which we also compete. In addition, banks owned by large national and regional holding companies and other community-based banks also operate in our primary market area. Some of these institutions are larger than us and, therefore, may have greater resources.

&#160;

Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and credit unions. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies, and specialty and captive finance companies.

&#160;

We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowing banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law now permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

Consistent with the Bank&#8217;s conversion to an Indiana-chartered commercial bank in December 2014, the Bank is continuing the process of transforming the composition of its balance sheet from that of a traditional thrift institution to that of a commercial bank. We intend to continue to emphasize residential lending, primarily secured by owner-occupied properties, but also to continue concentrating on ways to expand our consumer/retail banking capabilities and our commercial banking services with a focus on serving small businesses and emphasizing relationship banking in our primary market area.

&#160; 

The largest segments of our loan portfolio are commercial real estate loans and residential real estate mortgage loans, which are primarily one- to four-family residential loans, and, to a lesser extent, multi-family real estate and commercial business loans. We also originate residential and commercial construction loans, land and land development loans, and consumer loans. We generally originate loans for investment purposes, although, depending on the interest rate environment and our asset/liability management goals, we may sell into the secondary market the 25-year and 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, as well as the portion of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) that we originate under its 7(a) program. We do not offer, have not offered and have not purchased or acquired Alt-A, sub-prime or no-documentation loans.

&#160;

One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. Our origination of residential mortgage loans enables borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes located in Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Crawford and Washington Counties, Indiana, and the surrounding areas. A significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we had originated before 2005 are secured by non-owner occupied properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally carry a greater risk of loss than loans secured by owner-occupied properties. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Business &#8211; Our concentration in non-owner occupied real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Risk Management &#8211; Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets.&#8221; Since 2005, we have de-emphasized non-owner occupied residential mortgage lending and have focused, and intend to continue to focus, our residential mortgage lending primarily on originating residential mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied properties.

&#160;

Our residential lending policies and procedures conform to the secondary market guidelines. We generally offer a mix of adjustable-rate mortgage loans and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms of 10 to 30 years. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate loans compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to an initially discounted interest rate and loan fees for multi-year adjustable-rate mortgages. The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us based on our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions.

&#160;

Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually after an initial fixed period that typically ranges from one to five years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate typically equal to a margin above the one year U.S. Treasury index. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally one percentage point per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan. However, a portion of the adjustable-rate mortgage loan portfolio has a maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased of two percentage points per adjustment period and a lifetime interest rate cap generally of six percentage points over the initial interest rate of the loan.

&#160;

While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans on a regular basis. We do not offer loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest-only loans.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We generally do not make conventional loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80%, including that for non-owner occupied residential real estate loans whose loan-to-value ratios generally may not exceed 75%, or 65% where the borrower has more than five non-owner occupied loans outstanding. Non-owner occupied loans originated before 2005, however, were generally originated with loan-to-value ratios up to 80%. Loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% generally require private mortgage insurance. However, the total balance of residential mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 90% amounted to $13.7 million, of which some do not have private mortgage insurance or government guaranty. We generally require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We also generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans with principal balances of $250,000 or more. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for all loans located in flood hazard areas.

&#160;

At September 30, 2016, our largest one- to four-family residential loan had an outstanding balance of $1.5 million. This loan, which was originated in September 2016 and is secured by 12 duplexes containing 24 living units, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by small to moderately-sized office, retail and industrial properties located in our primary market area and are typically made to small business owners and professionals such as attorneys and accountants.

&#160;

We originate fixed-rate commercial real estate loans, generally with terms up to five years and payments based on an amortization schedule of 15 to 20 years, resulting in &#8220;balloon&#8221; balances at maturity. We also offer adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans, generally with terms up to five years and with interest rates typically equal to a margin above the prime lending rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Loans are secured by first mortgages, generally are originated with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% and often require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio and other factors.

&#160;

During 2013, we began a commercial real estate lending program that is focused on loans to high net worth individuals that are secured by low loan-to-value, single-tenant commercial properties that are generally leased to investment grade national-brand retailers, the borrowers and collateral properties for which are outside of our primary market area. This program is designed to diversify the Company&#8217;s geographic and credit risk profile given the geographic dispersion of the loans and collateral, and the investment grade credit of the national-brand lessees. The terms of the loans are generally consistent with the aforementioned terms of in-market commercial real estate loans; however, these cannot exceed 70% loan-to-value and loan maturities cannot exceed the expiration of the underlying leases. In addition, the Company has established guidelines with respect to concentrations by state, lessee and industry of lessees as a percent of the overall loan portfolio, and as a percent of capital. The average size of these loans originated was $1.1 million and the portfolio balance was $93.3 million at September 30, 2016. Our largest such loan, which was originated in May 2016 and secured by a single-tenant commercial retail building, had an outstanding balance of $3.8 million at September 30, 2016 and was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

At September 30, 2016, our largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding balance of $9.0 million. This loan, which was originated in September 2016, is secured by a commercial real estate development formerly owned by the Company that includes one multi-tenant, two single-tenant, and two two-tenant retail buildings. It was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016. See Notes 5, 7 and 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report for additional information.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Construction Loans. We originate construction loans for one-to four-family homes and commercial properties such as small industrial buildings, warehouses, retail shops and office units. Construction loans are typically for a term of 12 months with monthly interest only payments. Except for speculative loans, discussed below, repayment of construction loans typically comes from the proceeds of a permanent mortgage loan for which a commitment is typically in place when the construction loan is originated. We originate construction loans to a limited group of well-established builders in our primary market area and we limit the number of projects with each builder. Interest rates on these loans are generally tied to the prime lending rate. Construction loans, other than land development loans, generally will not exceed the lesser of 80% of the appraised value or 90% of the direct costs, excluding items such as developer fees, operating deficits or other items that do not relate to the direct development of the project. Generally, commercial construction loans require the personal guarantee of the owners of the business. We also offer construction loans for the financing of pre-sold homes, which convert into permanent loans at the end of the construction period. Such loans generally have a six-month construction period with interest only payments due monthly, followed by an automatic conversion to a 15-year to 30-year permanent loan with monthly payments of principal and interest. Occasionally, a construction loan to a builder of a speculative home will be converted to a permanent loan if the builder has not secured a buyer within a limited period of time after the completion of the home. We generally disburse funds on a percentage-of-completion basis following an inspection by a third party inspector.

&#160;

We also originate speculative construction loans to builders who have not identified a buyer or lessee for the completed property at the time of origination. At September 30, 2016, we had approved commitments for speculative construction loans of $10.6 million, of which $4.9 million was outstanding. We require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for speculative construction loans. At September 30, 2016, our largest construction loan relationship was for a commitment of $11.3 million, of which $1.1 million was outstanding but 80% of this loan is participated to other financial institutions. This loan, which was originated in June 2016 and is secured by a national brand hotel, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160; 

Land and Land Development Loans. On a limited basis, we originate loans to developers for the purpose of developing vacant land in our primary market area, typically for residential subdivisions. Land development loans are generally interest-only loans for a term of 18 to 24 months. We generally require a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the appraisal market value upon completion of the project. We generally do not require any cash equity from the borrower if there is sufficient indicated equity in the collateral property. Development plats and cost verification documents are required from borrowers before approving and closing the loan. Our loan officers are required to personally visit the proposed development site and the sites of competing developments. We also originate loans to individuals secured by undeveloped land held for investment purposes. At September 30, 2016, our largest land development loan had an outstanding balance of $2.0 million. This loan, which was originated in April 2016, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. We offer multi-family mortgage loans that are generally secured by properties in our primary market area. Multi-family loans are secured by first mortgages and generally are originated with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% and generally require specified debt service coverage ratios depending on the characteristics of the project. Rates and other terms on such loans generally depend on our assessment of the credit risk after considering such factors as the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio and other factors. At September 30, 2016, our largest multi-family mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of $1.9 million. This loan, which was originated in August 2010, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Consumer Loans. Although we offer a variety of consumer loans, our consumer loan portfolio consists primarily of home equity loans, both fixed-rate amortizing term loans with terms up to 15 years and adjustable rate lines of credit with interest rates equal to a margin above the prime lending rate. We also offer auto and truck loans, personal loans and small boat loans. Consumer loans typically have shorter maturities and higher interest rates than traditional one-to four-family lending. We typically do not make home equity loans with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 90%, including any first mortgage loan balance. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant&#8217;s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. At September 30, 2016, our largest consumer loan was a home equity line of credit with a commitment of $350,000, of which $291,000 was outstanding. This loan, which was originated in May 2014 and is secured by a first mortgage on a personal residence, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Commercial Business Loans. We typically offer commercial business loans to small businesses located in our primary market area. Commercial business loans are generally secured by equipment and general business assets. Key loan terms and covenants vary depending on the collateral, the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, credit history and other relevant factors, and personal guarantees are typically required as part of the loan commitment. At September 30, 2016, our largest commercial business loan was for a commitment of $7.5 million, of which $7.5 million was outstanding but $2.5 million had been participated to other financial institutions. This loan, which was originated in September 2016 is made to a local hospital, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Loan Underwriting Risks 

&#160;

Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.

&#160;

Non-Owner Occupied Residential Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by rental properties represent a unique credit risk to us and, as a result, we adhere to special underwriting guidelines. Of primary concern in non-owner occupied real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of the property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties often depend on the maintenance of the property and the payment of rent by its tenants. Payments on loans secured by rental properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on rental properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements and we consider and review a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower&#8217;s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. We generally require collateral on these loans to be a first mortgage along with an assignment of rents and leases. Until recently, if the borrower had multiple loans for rental properties with us, the loans were not cross-collateralized. If the borrower holds loans on more than four rental properties, a loan officer or collection officer is generally required to inspect these properties annually to determine if they are being properly maintained and rented. We have generally limited these loan relationships to an aggregate total of $500,000.

&#160;

Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and commercial real estate lending is the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In addition, some loans may contain covenants regarding ongoing cash flow coverage requirements. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower&#8217;s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. An environmental survey or environmental risk insurance is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Construction and Land and Land Development Loans. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#8217;s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the building. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a building having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment if liquidation is required. If we are forced to foreclose on a building before or at completion due to a default, we may be unable to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, speculative construction loans, which are loans made to home builders who, at the time of loan origination, have not yet secured an end buyer for the home under construction, typically carry higher risks than those associated with traditional construction loans. These increased risks arise because of the risk that there will be inadequate demand to ensure the sale of the property within an acceptable time. As a result, in addition to the risks associated with traditional construction loans, speculative construction loans carry the added risk that the builder will have to pay the property taxes and other carrying costs of the property until an end buyer is found. Land and land development loans have substantially similar risks to speculative construction loans.

&#160;

Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles and boats. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In the case of home equity loans, real estate values may be reduced to a level that is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan balance after accounting for the first mortgage loan balance. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.

&#160;

Commercial Business Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from his or her employment income or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower&#8217;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value.

&#160;

Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases. Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are existing customers, walk-in traffic, advertising, and referrals from customers and centers of influence, such as real estate agents, attorneys, accountants and other professionals.

&#160;

We have not historically sold whole loans, other than long-term fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, which we generally sell in the secondary market. We have not historically purchased whole loans; however, we acquired four brokered whole loans during the year ended September 30, 2012. The loans were purchased at an average of 90% of their principal balance and are secured by multi-family and retail shopping centers located in Indiana. At September 30, 2016, three of these loans remained outstanding with a total principal balance of $4.1 million and were performing in accordance with their original terms.

&#160;

While we generally do not sell participation interests in loans originated by us or purchase participation interests in loans originated by other financial institutions in order to supplement our lending portfolio, we may sell or purchase participation interests in loans from time to time depending on various factors. At September 30, 2016, $27.0 million of loans included sold participation interests of $12.8 million, for a net position of $14.2 million outstanding in our portfolio. At September 30, 2016, acquired participation interests of loans from two lending relationships totaled $1.0 million and our largest purchased participation interest with a single borrower was $837,000. This loan, which was originated in January 2014 and is secured by a first mortgage on an industrial building, was performing in accordance with its original terms at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Beginning in April 2015, the Bank hired a management team, business development officers (loan officers), underwriters and supporting staff that are seasoned and experienced in SBA lending in order to enhance the Company&#8217;s proficiency in SBA 7(a) program loan originations and sales. The Bank intends to continue hiring additional business development officers and appropriate supporting staff in order to grow this program, the borrowers and collateral for which are outside of our primary market area. The primary purpose of the program is to originate SBA 7(a) program loans and sell the amounts guaranteed by the SBA in the secondary market. The program is also designed to diversify the Company&#8217;s geographic and interest rate risk profile with respect to the retained unguaranteed amounts given the geographic dispersion of the loans and collateral, and their floating rate structure. The Company originated SBA loans with a total commitment of $27.0 million during the year end September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $23.5 million of SBA loans included sold guaranteed portions of $13.6 million, for a net position of $10.0 million outstanding in our portfolio. The amount outstanding in the Bank&#8217;s portfolio at September 30, 2016 included $5.1 million in SBA loans held for sale, $1.3 million in the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans not yet sold and $3.6 million in the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans sold. See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning of page F-1 of this annual report for additional information regarding the fair value election for SBA loans held for sale at September 30, 2015. All SBA loans held for sale were carried at the lower of cost or market value at September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Our decision to sell or purchase loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions, interest rate management, regulatory lending restrictions and liquidity needs.

&#160;

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our conventional lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Certain of our employees have been granted individual lending limits, which vary depending on the individual, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Generally, all loan requests for non-SBA 7(a) program lending relationships that exceed the individual officer lending limits, which is generally $250,000 secured or $50,000 unsecured, require committee or Board of Directors approval. Loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of individual office lending limits but less than $1.5 million require approval by the Officer Loan Committee and loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of $1.5 million but less than $3.0 million require approval of the Executive Loan Committee. The Executive Loan Committee consists of the President, Area President, Chief Lending Officer, Chief of Credit Administration and two senior commercial lending officers, and the Officer Loan Committee consists of the same but also includes certain other officers designated by the Board of Directors. Loans resulting in aggregated lending relationships in excess of $3.0 million require approval by both the Executive Loan Committee and the Board of Directors.

&#160;

Our SBA 7(a) program lending activities also follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our Board of Directors and management. Certain of our employees have been granted individual lending limits, which is $2.0 million for the aggregate loan balance, of which 75% or greater is guaranteed by the SBA. Generally, all SBA 7(a) program loan requests for lending relationships that exceed the individual officer lending limits require approval by the SBA Officer Loan Committee. The SBA Officer Loan Committee consists of the President, Chief Lending Officer, Chief of Credit Administration, Chief of SBA Lending, Senior SBA Lending Officer and a senior commercial lending officer. The aggregated lending relationships for the SBA 7(a) program may not exceed $5.0 million according to SBA guidelines and therefore no loan requests require approval by the Board of Directors given that the portion of SBA 7(a) program loans that are not guaranteed by the SBA may not exceed $1.25 million.

&#160;

Loans to One Borrower. The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15% of our stated capital and reserves. At September 30, 2016, our regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $10.4 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship was for a commitment of $9.7 million, of which $9.5 million was outstanding, and was performing according to its original terms at that date. This loan relationship is secured by various commercial real estate properties and land intended for future development.

&#160;

Loan Commitments. We issue commitments for residential and commercial mortgage loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate mortgage loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers. Generally, our loan commitments expire after 30 days. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this annual report.

Investment Activities 

&#160;

We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, securities of various state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in other permissible securities. As a member of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Home Loan Bank System, in particular a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;), First Savings Bank is also required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB.

&#160;

At September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency and sponsored enterprises securities, mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, privately-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities, and a pass-through asset-backed security guaranteed by the SBA. We have invested $10.0 million in a managed brokerage account that invests in small and medium lot, investment grade municipal bonds and these securities are classified as trading account securities. The brokerage account is managed by an investment advisory firm registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At September 30, 2016, trading account securities recorded at fair value totaled $9.3 million.

&#160; 

Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, and to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments at a favorable return when loan demand is weak. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of the investment policy. Messrs. Myers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Schoen, our Chief Financial Officer, are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Board of Directors reviews the status of our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if warranted.

&#160; 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

&#160;

General. Deposits, borrowings, and loan and investment security repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows, loan prepayments and investment security calls are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.

&#160;

Deposit Accounts. Deposits are attracted from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), regular savings accounts and time deposits. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing weekly. Our deposit pricing strategy has typically been to offer competitive rates on all types of deposit products, and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term.

&#160;

Borrowings. We use advances from the FHLB to supplement our investable funds. First Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. First Savings Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of the U.S., U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution&#8217;s net worth or on the FHLB&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s creditworthiness. We have two federal funds purchased line of credit facilities with other financial institutions that are subject to continued borrower eligibility and are intended to support short-term liquidity needs. We also utilize brokered certificates of deposit and retail repurchase agreements as sources of borrowings and may use broker repurchase agreements and internet certificates of deposit from time to time, depending on our liquidity needs and pricing of these facilities versus other funding alternatives.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Personnel 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016, we had 161 full-time employees and 17 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

&#160;

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Savings Bank and First Savings Insurance Risk Management, Inc (the &#8220;Captive&#8221;). The Bank has three subsidiaries, Southern Indiana Financial Corporation and FFCC, Inc. (&#8220;FFCC&#8221;), both of which are organized as Indiana corporations, and First Savings Investments, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Southern Indiana Financial Corporation is an independent insurance agency, offering various types of annuities and life insurance policies, but is currently inactive. FFCC participated in the development and leasing of commercial real estate. First Savings Investments, Inc. holds and manages an investment securities portfolio. The Captive, an insurance subsidiary of the Company formed during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014, is a Nevada corporation that provides property and casualty insurance to the Company, the Bank and the Bank&#8217;s active subsidiaries. In addition, the Captive provides reinsurance to eight other third-party insurance captives for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in the insurance marketplace.

&#160;

In accordance with the Plan of Complete Liquidation adopted by FFCC&#8217;s board of directors and approval by the Bank as its sole shareholder on December 21, 2016, FFCC will voluntarily dissolve and completely liquidate effective December 31, 2016. As a result of the liquidation, FFCC will distribute its net assets to the Bank on December 31, 2016.

&#160; 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

First Savings Bank converted its charter from a federal savings bank to an Indiana commercial bank on December 19, 2014. First Savings Bank, as an Indiana commercial bank, is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;INDFI&#8221;). As a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, First Savings Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator is the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). First Savings Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. First Savings Bank must file reports with its regulatory agencies concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the INDFI and FRB to evaluate First Savings Bank&#8217;s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the INDFI, FRB, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on First Savings Financial Group and First Savings Bank and their operations.

&#160;

Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to First Savings Bank and First Savings Financial Group are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Savings Bank and First Savings Financial Group.

&#160;

Regulation of First Savings Bank 

&#160; 

Business Activities. The activities of Indiana banks, such as First Savings Bank, are governed by Indiana and federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which banks may engage. As an Indiana commercial bank, First Savings Bank is not constrained by percentage of assets or capital limits on specific types of lending, as was the case with the previous federal savings bank charter.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Federal law generally limits the activities as principal and equity investments of FDIC insured state banks to those permitted for national banks. Activities as principal of state bank subsidiaries are also limited to those permitted for subsidiaries of national banks, absent regulatory approval for a particular subsidiary activity. In addition, federal law limits the authority of Federal Reserve System member banks, such as First Savings Bank, to purchase investment securities. Generally, such authority is limited to investment securities permissible for national banks, which includes investment grade, marketable debt obligations. Certain activities, such as the establishment of new branches and mergers and acquisitions, require the prior approval of both the INDFI and the FRB.

&#160;

Loans to One Borrower. Indiana law establishes limits on a bank&#8217;s loans to one borrower. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, an Indiana bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. These limits are similar to those applicable to First Savings Bank under its previous federal savings bank charter.

&#160;

Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state chartered Federal Reserve System member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8% and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

As noted, the capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

&#160;

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

&#160;

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and is increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution&#8217;s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, First Savings Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that certain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to state member banks. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.

&#160;

Subject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; within specified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FRB within 45 days of the date an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets when it was deemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FRB could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.

&#160;

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. First Savings Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s existing risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain specified adjustments. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued final rules, effective April 1, 2011, implementing changes to the assessment process. The changes resulted from the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s directive to base assessments on an institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible capital instead of deposits, as had been the FDIC&#8217;s practice. The assessment rates (inclusive of adjustments) currently range from two and one half to 45 basis points of total capital less tangible assets, depending upon the particular institution&#8217;s risk category. The rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future when the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.

&#160;

Due to difficult economic conditions in 2008 and 2009, deposit insurance per account owner was raised to $250,000. That change was made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a target fund ratio of 2%, which it has established as a long term goal.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Savings Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FRB or FDIC. The management of First Savings Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.

&#160; 

Limitation on Dividends. Indiana law authorizes a bank&#8217;s board of directors to declare dividends out of profits as deemed expedient. However, application to and the prior approval of the INDFI and FRB is required before payment of a dividend if total dividends for the calendar year exceed net income for the year to date plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years. Federal law specifies that a bank may not pay a dividend if it fails to satisfy any applicable federal capital requirement after the dividend.

&#160;

If First Savings Bank&#8217;s capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the FRB notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to pay dividends or otherwise make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the INDFI and/or FRB could prohibit a proposed capital distribution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the regulator determined that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness in various areas such as internal controls and information systems, internal audit, loan documentation and credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that a state member bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the FRB may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. All federally-insured banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution&#8217;s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. First Savings Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.

&#160;

Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits First Savings Bank&#8217;s authority to engage in transactions with &#8220;affiliates&#8221; ( e.g ., any entity that controls or is under common control with First Savings Bank, including First Savings Financial Group and its other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of a bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by First Savings Financial Group to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, First Savings Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that First Savings Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on First Savings Bank&#8217;s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Enforcement. The INDFI maintains enforcement authority over First Savings Bank, including the power to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and remove directors, officers or employees. The INDFI also has the power to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank upon insolvency, imminent insolvency, unsafe or unsound condition or certain other situations. The FRB has primary federal enforcement responsibility over Federal Reserve System member state banks and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC, as deposit insurer, has the authority to recommend to the FRB that enforcement action be taken with respect to a member bank. If action is not taken by the FRB, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. In general, regulatory enforcement actions occur with respect to situations involving unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, violations of law or regulation or breaches of fiduciary duty. Federal and Indiana law also establish criminal penalties for certain violations.

&#160;

Assessments. Indiana banks are required to pay assessments to the INDFI to fund the agency&#8217;s operations. The assessments paid to the INDFI by First Savings Bank for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 totaled $60,000.

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Savings Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. First Savings Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. First Savings Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB capital stock at September 30, 2016 of $6.0 million.

&#160;

Federal Reserve Board System. The FRB regulations require banks to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for 2016: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $110.2 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the FRB) are exempted from the reserve requirements. First Savings Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually and, for 2017, establish a 3% reserve ratio for aggregate transaction accounts up to $115.1 million, a 10% ratio above $115.1 million, and an exemption of $15.5 million. In October 2008, the FRB began paying interest on certain reserve balances.

&#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160;

First Savings Bank&#8217;s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, including the:

&#160;

&#8226; Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; &#8226; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; &#8226; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; &#8226; Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; &#8226; Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and &#8226; rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. &#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The operations of First Savings Bank also are subject to laws such as the:

&#160;

&#8226; Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; &#8226; Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and &#8226; Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as &#8220;Check 21&#8221;), which gives &#8220;substitute checks,&#8221; such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. &#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

General. Upon the charter conversion of First Savings Bank from a federal savings bank to an Indiana commercial bank, First Savings Financial Group became a bank holding company rather than a savings and loan holding company, and simultaneously elected financial holding company status. As a bank holding company, First Savings Financial Group is subject to FRB regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRB has enforcement authority over First Savings Financial Group and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to First Savings Bank. The INDFI also has examination and enforcement authority since First Savings Financial Group controls an Indiana bank.

&#160;

As a bank holding company, First Savings Financial Group is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior FRB approval is required for any bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the FRB, prior approval may for such acquisitions also be necessary from other agencies including the INDFI and agencies that regulate the target.

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in nonbanking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 

&#160;

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed,&#8221; to opt to become a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. First Savings Financial Group has elected to become a financial holding company because of the activities of the Captive.

&#160;

Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to amend its consolidated minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies to make them no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule concerning regulatory capital accomplished this directive, effective January 1, 2015. However, legislation was enacted in December 2014 which required the FRB to amend its &#8220;Small Bank Holding Company&#8221; exemption from consolidated bank holding company capital requirements to generally extend the applicability of the exemption from $500 million to $1 billion in assets. Regulations doing so were effective May 15, 2015. Consequently, bank holding companies of under $1 billion in consolidated assets, such as First Savings Financial Group, are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases.

&#160;

The FRB&#8217;s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. 

&#160;

A bank holding company is generally required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or violate any law, regulation, FRB order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 

&#160;

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company&#8217;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends&#8217; previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company&#8217;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be limited if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The guidance also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a bank holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or where the redemption or repurchase of common or preferred stock cause a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding at the end of a quarter compared to the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of First Savings Financial Group to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

&#160;

The status of First Savings Financial Group as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 

&#160;

Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as First Savings Financial Group unless the FRB has been given 60 days&#8217; prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company&#8217;s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company&#8217;s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with First Savings Financial Group, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Indiana law requires INDFI approval for changes in control of companies controlling Indiana banks, with &#8220;control&#8221; defined to mean power to direct the management or policies of the holding company or power to vote at least 25% of the company&#8217;s voting securities.

INCOME TAXATION 

&#160; 

Federal Taxation 

&#160; 

General. We report our income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly our reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. For its 2016 fiscal year, the Company&#8217;s maximum federal income tax rate was 34%.

&#160;

First Savings Financial Group and First Savings Bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement. Because First Savings Financial Group owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of First Savings Bank, First Savings Financial Group and First Savings Bank are members of an affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, of which group First Savings Financial Group is the common parent corporation. As a result of this affiliation, First Savings Bank may be included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with First Savings Financial Group and, if a decision to file a consolidated tax return is made, the parties agree to compensate each other for their individual share of the consolidated tax liability and/or any tax benefits provided by them in the filing of the consolidated federal income tax return.

&#160;

Our Federal income tax returns have not been audited during the last five years.

&#160;

Bad Debt Reserves. For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code, as the Bank did prior to its conversion to a commercial bank in December 2014, were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. Approximately $4.6 million of our accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless First Savings Bank makes a &#8220;non-dividend distribution&#8221; to First Savings Financial Group as described below.

&#160;

Distributions. If First Savings Bank makes &#8220;non-dividend distributions&#8221; to First Savings Financial Group, the distributions will be considered to have been made from First Savings Bank&#8217;s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its reserves as of September 30, 1988, to the extent of the &#8220;non-dividend distributions,&#8221; and then from First Savings Bank&#8217;s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in First Savings Bank&#8217;s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of First Savings Bank&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of First Savings Bank&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in First Savings Bank&#8217;s taxable income.

&#160;

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if First Savings Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to First Savings Financial Group, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% federal corporate income tax rate. First Savings Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

State Taxation 

&#160;

Indiana. Effective July 1, 2013, Indiana amended its tax code to provide for reductions in the franchise tax rate. For the Company&#8217;s tax year ended September 30, 2016, Indiana imposed a 7.5% franchise tax based on a financial institution&#8217;s adjusted gross income as defined by statute. The Indiana franchise tax rate will be reduced to 7.0%, 6.5%, 6.5%, 6.25%, 6.0%, 5.5%, 5.0% and 4.9% for the Company&#8217;s tax years ending September 30, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 and years thereafter, respectively. In computing adjusted gross income, deductions for municipal interest, U.S. Government interest, the bad debt deduction computed using the reserve method and pre-1990 net operating losses are disallowed.
