Overview 

&#160; 

Virtual was formed as a Nevada corporation on January 6, 2009. Virtual Learning plans to become a subscription-based online education company. We intend to provide instruction through our fully animated talking virtual textbooks and our web based platform www.mathisbasic.com . Our fully animated, interactive featured, colorful, and audio virtual textbooks have combined rigorous content along with a variety of practice problems, activities, assessments, games, and productivity tools that we hope will improve the performance of students via proprietary our web-based platform that engage students, reinforce and reward learning achievement. 

&#160; 

Our mission is to maximize a child&#8217;s potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education, regardless of geographic location or socio-economic background. We provide a continuum of technology-based educational products and solutions to students and families as we strive to transform a student&#8217;s learning experience into one that delivers individualized education on a highly scalable basis. 

&#160; 

Our &#8220;Math is Basic&#8221; series of virtual math textbooks and assessment programs is intended to be our core product line that will help students in First through 12 th grade, master grade level academic standards in a fun and engaging manner. We provide our products via a proprietary web-based platform through one of our several websites on the World Wide Web with the URLs www.mathisbasic.com , www.scienceisbasic.com and www.readingisbasic.com . Please note though that we have only one primary website www.mathisbasic.com dedicated to math. 

&#160; 

Virtual Learning is also a producer and distributor of computer software and video educational materials on CD and DVD formatted disks and in a textbook ePub format, which will be available through various distributors and our website either as a download or in boxed format. We have combined rigorous content in math with interactive features and games that engage students, reinforce, and reward learning achievement. 

&#160; 

We plan to capitalize on two significant trends in the education market: (1) an increased focus on higher academic standards and educator accountability for student achievement, which has led to periodic assessment in the classroom to gauge student learning and inform instruction, also known as formative assessment, and (2) the increased availability and utilization of web-based technologies to enhance and supplement teacher instruction, engage today&#8217;s technology-savvy learners and improve student outcomes. 

&#160; 

We have completed 5 titles on CD formatted disks relating to the teaching of basic English to foreign speaking individuals. These titles include &#8220;English for Russian Speaking People&#8221;; English for Portuguese Speaking People&#8221;; &#8220;English for Spanish Speaking People&#8221;; &#8220;English for Chinese Speaking People&#8221;; and &#8220;English for Polish Speaking People&#8221;. These are not yet available online but are available CD formatted Discs as software. 

&#160; 

In 2011 we completed virtual software textbooks in the Adobe Flash format with the titles: &#8220;First Grade Math&#8221;; &#8220;Second Grade Math&#8221;; &#8220;Third Grade Math&#8221;; Third Grade Math: Geometry&#8221;;&#8221; Fourth Grade math: Geometry&#8221;; &#8220;Fifth Grade Math: Geometry&#8221;; &#8220;First Grade Math: Learning to Tell Time&#8221;; Second Grade Math: Learning to Tell Time&#8221;; &#8220;Third Grade Math: Algebra&#8221;; &#8220;Mr. Clock for First Grade&#8221;; &#8220;Mr. Clock Teaching Time&#8221;; and &#8220;Mr. Clock Teaches Elapsed Time&#8221; and assessment based review level titles for grades first through third grade . Our other educational titles on CD and or DVD formatted disks will consist primarily of virtual mathematics text books and work book courses for grades First grade through college level. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

During 2012, we added to our expanded inventory of titles by converting all of our software titles into the new ePub electronic format that allowed us to begin marketing our titles through Amazon&#8217;s Kindle and Barnes and Nobles Nook systems in the latter half of 2012. These titles include &#8220; First Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;,&#8221; First Grade Math Workbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;First Grade Math Workbook Vol. 3&#8221;, &#8220;First Grade Math Workbook Vol. 4&#8221;, &#8220;Second Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Second Grade Math Workbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;Third Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Third Grade Math Workbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;Third Grade Math Workbook Vol. 3&#8221;, &#8220;Fourth Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Fourth Grade Math Workbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;Fourth Grade Math Workbook Vol 3&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Math Workbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Geometry Textbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Geometry Textbook Vol. 2&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Math Geometry Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Fifth Grade Math Algebra Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Sixth Grade Math Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;High School Geometry Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;High School Trigonometry Basics Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;High School Trigonometry Workbook Vol. 1&#8221;, &#8220;Calculus Vol. 1. Per Amazon&#8217;s recommendation we established our retail price at $2.99 per titles. These titles are sold as an automatic download through Amazon and Barnes and Noble. We receive a 65% royalty on each sale. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we were in the process of converting our website from Adobe Flash to a WordPress platform. Adobe Flash has continued to experience problems of acceptance and vulnerability to outside hackers. While WordPress is used by 59.2% of all the websites whose content management system we know. This is 26.2% of all websites. At the time of the filing of this Form 10-K we have not been able to gain control of the changes made during 2015 by our former President and chief programmer Thomas P. Monahan who died April 4, 2015. While we hope to do so the references to progress during 2015 that appear throughout the Business of the Company section of this Form 10-K reflect additions to our technology that may not be recovered by the Company. 

&#160; 

We do not intend to follow the core curriculum requirements as sponsored by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) but only use it as a guide in formulating math problem questions. However we intend to enhance the range and scope of our materials and questions based upon traditional curriculum requirements found throughout the United States prior to adoption of this curriculum by the forty-three states, the District of Columbia, four territories, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) who have adopted the Common Core State Standards. 

&#160; 

Since we were short cash flow from operations and we were unable to raise any additional cash from private or public sources to pay for our anticipated marketing program during 2015. We instead relied upon the power of the marketing exposure of our ePub titles through Amazon&#8217;s Kindle and Barnes and Noble&#8217;s Nook system to help spark sales in our ePub titles. We experienced reduced revenue of $107 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $400 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 from the sale of our ePub titles. As encouraged as we were during the year with Amazon&#8217;s and Barnes and Noble&#8217;s systems of international marketing, it became clear that sales through their systems were not going to materialize. In addition, because of lack of funds, we were unable to launch an effective integrated internet marketing approach which must include the use of Face Book, Twitter and Pinterest. 

&#160; 

During 2014 and 2015, our analysis of our monthly visitors through our host provider indicated that a natural rate of growth in users was not occurring as expected. We had envisioned that by making all of our courses available to all interested users and providing user friendly self assessments to check the results of users who completed our courses was also not occurring. 

&#160; 

Several trends in the communications industry forced us to make significant changes in the platform we are using to present our online educational materials via the internet, going away from Adobe Flash, and marketing our software products: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The growth in the number of students adopting the Apple iPhone as their primary communicating and entertainment device. Apple&#8217;s iPhone led 2013 US consumer smartphone sales with a 45% share. With more than 120 million smartphones sold in the U.S. in 2013, Apple&#8217;s iPhone accounted for nearly half of those, taking a 45 percent share in its home market last year, new data released by the The NPD Group Phone Track. Lagging behind the two-horse race was LG, which represented 8 percent of smartphones sold in America last year. HTC took fourth with 6 percent, while Motorola came in fifth with 4 percent. In a Mobile Learning | Research project reported on May 8, 2013 by David Nagel, Most elementary and secondary students are using mobile devices in their studies, either in the classroom or at home. And, according to a new study, the majority would like to be able to use them more in class. Tech Times reports By Horia Ungureanu, Tech Times | November 25, 2015. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; Strategy Analytics released the latest &#8220;Tablet Operating System Forecast&#8221; report and from the looks of it, Windows tablets are growing in popularity at an accelerated rate. &#160; &#160; &#160; When it comes to sales of Windows tablets, numbers from the first nine months of 2014 show a year on year increase of 58 percent. Marketing experts estimate that the total number of Windows slates to be sold in 2015 is 22 million. If the predictions are correct, Microsoft will have ten percent of the tablet market share, slightly less than half of Apple&#8217;s score of 22 percent. Android is still king of the hill, with 68 percent of global tablets running on the system. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A multi-annual analysis, however, shows that in 2019 Microsoft will register more than double its 2015 record of 49 million Windows-powered slates sold. This will give the company 18 percent of the tablet market, while Apple is forecasted to have a stable 23 percent. From the three main rivals, Google&#8217;s presence will shrink to 59 percent, experts in the field stated &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; An NEA Newsletter reported on by Edward Graham that the number of kids with phones has just been blown out of the water the last couple of years. &#8220;Two years ago, if any of the kids in my room had a phone, it was a dial-phone that maybe they could text on. And now it&#8217;s all smartphones.&#8221; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; According to data compiled by the research firm Nielsen, 58 percent of American children from 13- to 17-years-old owned a smartphone as of July 2012&#8212;an increase of more than 60 percent over the previous year. And with over 50 percent of mobile phone users in America now using smartphones, the numbers only seems to be growing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; With their easy internet access, a multitude of education-friendly apps, and the ability to be used at a moment&#8217;s notice (after all, what smartphone-owning teenager would go anywhere without their phone?), smartphones have all the tools necessary to boost student learning. &#160; 

In the fourth quarter of 2014, management decided to abandon Adobe Flash as a platform to present our educational products over the Internet and adopt WordPress as our platform. Since the Company has only one programmer on staff and insufficient cash to hire additional help, management was forced take it upon itself to conduct the conversion process. This would entail the conversion of several thousand math questions and examples from the Flash platform to the WordPress platform. 

&#160; 

During 2014, we changed web hosts from Yahoo to Hostgator reducing our cost of operations significantly. We also took advantage of HostGators extensive library of WordPress themes and pluggins. The flexibility of the extensive inventory of WordPress pluggins offered by Hostgator would permit us to replicate the diversity of question and answer types of questions. We also took advantage of the fact that Hostgator&#8217;s level of security for our Php database is significantly improved over that offered by Yahoo. This fact alone is of critical importance in the decision to leave Yahoo since it affects the security of the name and address database of the children subscribers we hope to build upon. 

&#160; 

One of the great advantages to be found in the conversion of our inventory of learning materials, questions and answers lies in the ability of WordPress file being convertible into an app. This would enable our titles to be saleable through Google Play or the App Store. 

&#160; 

The business of the Company was originally developed through a prior entity formed under the name the Terra Media, Ltd., a Delaware company (&#8220;Terra&#8221;). Terra did complete a registration statement pursuant to the 1933 Act and was approved for trading on the Bulletin Board. On June 2, 2008, the volume in Terra&#8217;s Common Stock was non-existent. 

&#160; 

In January 2009, Terra decided to pursue the purchase and development of coal leases and entered into an agreement with Thomas Monahan to sell to Mr. Monahan the assets of Terra&#8217;s subsidiary Ding Dong School, Ltd. for a purchase price of $5,000 which included certain assets including computers, various software titles, Trade Marks, and production software with a book value of $37,688, assumption of officer loans aggregating $28,437, and the assumption of accrued liabilities aggregating $35,085. Mr. Monahan was the former President and controlling shareholder of both Terra and Ding Dong School, Ltd. and during the time when Mr. Monahan was in control of Terra, the Ding Dong School subsidiary was the only asset of Terra. Control, of Terra was purchased by Catherine Balloqui who also became Terra&#8217;s President and sole director. In 2009, Ms. Balloqui made the determination that Ding Dong School&#8217;s business was less desirable than energy assets and Terra then sold the assets to Mr. Monahan in exchange for the forgiveness of $5,000 owed to Roger Fidler by Terra for legal fees. Mr. Monahan retains no shares in Terra and Ms. Balloqui has no shares in Virtual Learning.

&#160; 

The U.S. educational market is estimated to be about $1.3 trillion dollars, and usually broken down into 4 major sectors: early childhood education: $70 billion; K-12: $670 billion; Higher education: $475 billion and Adult learning, continued education: $55 billion. Almost 9% of US GDP is spent on education, it&#8217;s the second largest market, behind healthcare, in the United States. There are about 100,000 public schools, 30,000 private schools, and roughly 4,000 charter or other schools. 

&#160; 

The U.S. market for K-12 education is large and online learning is gaining greater acceptance. For example: 

&#160; 

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (&#8220;NCES&#8221;), a division of the U.S. Department of Education, approximately 54,876,000 million students will attend K-12 public schools in the February, 2016. Total private school enrollment is estimated to be 5,268, 090 with 3,976,960 in elementary school and 1,291,130 in secondary education, according to the Digest of Educational Statistics: 2011, Table 205.20. In addition, according to a report by National Home Education Research Institute, approximately 1,773,000: total home school enrollment. 1,773,000 or 3.4% (estimate) of America&#8217;s school population according to the Digest of Educational Statistics: 2012, Table 206.10 

&#160; 

Many of these students took an online courses and a small percentage enrolled in a full-time online program. As of 2013, six states mandated the completion of an online course prior to high school graduation (Keeping Pace Report, 2013). Multi-district fully online schools served an estimated 310,000 students in 30 states during the 2012-13 school year. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to the NCES, the public school system alone encompassed more than 98,800 schools and approximately 13,600 districts during the 2011-12 school year. The NCES estimates that total spending in the K-12 market was projected to be $563 billion for the 2012-13 school year, and that public school spending will increase by 24 percent, to $699 billion, by 2022-23. 

&#160; 

According to the NCEA, the total expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States amounted to $621 billion in 2011&#8211;12, or $12,401 per public school student enrolled in the fall (in constant 2013&#8211;14 dollars, based on the Consumer Price Index). These expenditures include $11,014 per student in current expenditures for operation of schools; $1,018 for capital outlay (i.e., expenditures for property and for buildings and alterations completed by school district staff or contractors); and $370 for interest on school debt. 

&#160; 

From 2000&#8211;01 to 2011&#8211;12, current expenditures per student enrolled in the fall in public elementary and secondary schools increased by 11 percent (from $9,904 to $11,014 in constant 2013&#8211;14 dollars). Current expenditures per student peaked in 2008&#8211;09 at $11,537 and have decreased each year since then. The amount for 2011&#8211;12 ($11,014) was 3 percent ($318) less than the amount for 2010&#8211;11 ($11,332). 

&#160; 

According to the International Association for K-12 Online Learning (&#8220;iNACOL&#8221;), in 2013, all 50 states had established a significant form of online learning initiative. In addition, according to iNACOL, 1.82 million K-12 students participated in a formal online learning program. Many parents and educators are seeking alternatives to traditional classroom-based education for a variety of reasons. Demand for these alternatives is evident in the expanding number of choices available to parents and students. Acceptance of online learning initiatives, including not only virtual and blended public schools, but also online courses, credit recovery, remediation, testing and Internet-based professional development, has continued to grow. Districts are also rapidly adopting online learning to expand course offerings, provide schedule flexibility, increase graduation rates and lower the cost to deliver education. 

&#160; 

As evidenced by the varying options being utilized by students, no single educational model works equally well for all students. Children today utilize technology in all aspects of their lives, and we expect them to extend their use of technology to their educational needs and choices. Families come from a broad range of social, economic and academic backgrounds. They share the desire for individualized instruction to maximize their children&#8217;s potential. Examples of students for whom this solution fits include, but are not limited to, families with: (i) students seeking to learn at their own pace; (ii) students with safety, social and health concerns about their local school; (iii) students with disabilities who are underserved in traditional classrooms; (iv) students for whom the local public school is not meeting their needs; (v) students who seek more flexibility than traditional brick and mortar schools can provide. 

&#160; 

Most students in the United States will continue to be educated in school buildings and classrooms. However, we also believe that the academic benefits for certain student segments, combined with the significant savings for taxpayers, will continue to drive states and districts to incorporate online solutions into their school-based programs. One of the challenges traditional schools continue to face is adoption of technology and innovative new learning devices. 

&#160; 

Key Dynamics in the K-12 Education Market 

&#160; 

The education industry of the U.S. has undergone several changes over the past few years and continues to invite significant spending by the public. The overall growth of the industry will be driven by rising responsiveness of people towards the benefits of early education, rising awareness of the advantages of higher education and growing demand for online teaching methods. The major trends in the industry include growth of educational content and technology, rising demand for digital textbooks, high penetration rate for U.S. postsecondary education sector, students shift towards online education and students dependence on family for higher education funding. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to Jeff Dunn of the the Daily Genius, the size of the U.S. educational market is 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The Early Childhood Education Market is valued at roughly US$70 billion &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The K-12 Education Market is valued at roughly US$670 billion &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Adult Learning Market (continued education) is about US$55 billion. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Tutoring and Test Prep market is only about US$1 billion. Pretty small, really. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Online Education market is about US$20 billion. A bit bigger than expected. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Print and Online Textbook market is about US$8 billion. &#160; 

Legislative Environment. There are several key legislative initiatives currently impacting the K-12 education market, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Common Core Standards. A requirement for RttT applicants is to signal their intent to officially adopt the Common Core Standards for K-12 in reading and mathematics. As of December 31, 2011, 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had officially adopted the new standards, although adoption of the standards does not bring immediate change in the classroom. We believe that implementation of the Common Core Standards will be a long-term process, as states rethink their teacher training, curriculum, instructional materials and testing. We continue to believe that Common Core Standards implementation will evolve in different ways across the adopting states and will raise the overall rigor of curriculum and assessments, but we increasingly believe that the federal government will not mandate national standards and assessments. Furthermore, there is now a growing movement in some states to oppose the Common Core Standards in order to prevent unwanted federal control over education. A study recently published by Pioneer Institute, the American Principles Project, and the Pacific Research Institute of California estimated that it will cost nearly $16 billion for 45 states plus the District of Columbia to implement the Common Core Standards over a seven year period. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; State and Local Funding. Most of our U.S. potential customers are public schools and school districts that are dependent on the availability of public funds, with about 46% of total education expenditures coming from state funds and 45% coming from local funds, which have become more limited as many states or districts face budget cuts due to decreases in their tax bases and rates. State and federal educational funding is primarily funded through income taxes, and local educational funding is primarily funded through property taxes. 

&#160; 

State tax revenues grew by 6.8 percent in the second quarter of 2015, the final quarter of the fiscal year for 46 states, according to the most recent State Revenue Report of the Rockefeller Institute. Personal income tax growth was robust at 14.2 percent, which was driven by strong payments with final returns up 20.0 percent and estimated taxes up 18.2 percent. This trend is not expected to continue, as this year&#8217;s revenue figures were bolstered by the strong stock market of 2014. States expect fiscal year 2016 to be weaker than 2015, largely because of an anticipated slowdown in income tax revenue, according to Lucy Dadayan and Donald J. Boyd, November 16, 2015 

&#160; 

Personal income taxes are the bedrock of state tax revenues. States&#8217; fiscal conditions have improved since the Great Recession ended more than six years ago, but their recoveries are incomplete. Despite these challenges, personal income in all states has bounced back above pre-recession figures, though growth has fallen short of historic norms. Nationally, total state tax revenue recovered more than two years ago from its plunge during the recession. But state to state, the recovery has been uneven due to differences in economic conditions as well as tax policy choices. For the first time, tax collections in a majority of states&#8212;29&#8212;were higher in the second quarter of 2015 than at their peaks before or during the downturn, after adjusting for inflation. States with below-peak tax revenue still have less purchasing power than they did more than six years ago. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; States have only partially rebuilt their financial cushions after tapping them to plug budget gaps during the recession. At the end of fiscal year 2015, only 18 states could cover more government expenses using rainy day funds and general fund balances than they could have in fiscal 2007, just before the recession. Four states had less than five days&#8217; worth of expenses set aside for budget shortfalls. &#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe the following are our key competitive strengths: 

&#160; 

Accessible, Dynamic Web-based Platform. Our products are delivered primarily online, in a Windows based format so they can be used by teachers and students on computers wherever internet access is available, such as classrooms, computer labs, media centers, school libraries, public libraries or at home. Our programs are compatible with existing school and school district enterprise systems using the Microsoft Windows operating system and require no additional software, no installation or maintenance and no extensive implementation or training. Moreover, unlike traditional workbooks or software products, our web-based product content is easily and quickly updated. 

&#160; 

Our adoption of WordPress as our online platform will permit us to be viewed by Apple and Windows based mobile devices, iTablets, laptop and tabletop computer systems. WordPress started as just a blogging system, but has evolved to be used as a full content management system and so much more through the thousands of plugins and widgets and themes. WordPress is a free and open-source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. WordPress was used by more than 23.3% of the top 10 million websites. WordPress is the most popular blogging system in use on the Web at more than 60 million websites 

&#160; 

The Market for Supplemental Learning Materials . Schools use a variety of supplemental materials to augment their core curriculum, provide remediation and enrichment and offer additional learning opportunities in the classroom and at home. These materials include traditional print-based materials, such as textbooks, workbooks, problem sheets and printed reading materials. With increased availability and use of computers in the classroom and at home, vendors have developed software and, increasingly, online programs and content as an alternative to print-based materials. 

&#160; 

David Nagel on July 1, 2013 in The Journal reported that Public school teachers spent $1.6 billion of their own money on classroom supplies and gear in the 2012-2013 school year. All told, teachers spent $3.2 billion on classroom tools this school year, only half of which was funded for them. 

&#160; 

In a survey of teacher spending for the 2015 school year Last year, Agile Education Marketing SheerID teamed up to conduct a survey of K-12 teachers to find out more about teacher spending habits. The results were so interesting, that we surveyed over 500 teachers again this year, and now we all get to geek out over the results. 

&#160; 

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , at least thirty states in the U.S. provided less per-pupil funding for K-12 students during the 2014-2015 school year than they did before the recession hit. About 46% of total educational spending comes from state funds. The teachers we surveyed were experiencing the aftershocks of budget cuts as more of the money spent on their classrooms came from their own pockets instead of their schools or districts. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The average amount of their own money that teachers spent was $490 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The average amount teachers received from their school to spend on classrooms was $300 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The average amount teachers received from school districts was $247 &#160; 

Although education budgets fluctuate from state to state and district to district, teachers&#8217; average spending for classroom supplies has stayed steady for the past two years, hovering right around $500. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Of that nearly $500 that teachers spend out-of-pocket, 57% was spent on classroom supplies while 9% was spent on instructional materials. 

&#160; 

Limitations of Traditional Print Products. Educators increasingly are recognizing the limitations of traditional print-based textbook and workbook learning materials, which are static, cannot be quickly corrected for errors or up dated to address evolving standards, cannot provide individualized feedback to students, do not provide teachers with a method to quickly track student progress and become ragged and obsolete with time and usage. Such traditional print-based learning materials are costly and need to be replaced on a regular basis due to the publication of newer editions or, in the case of workbooks, use by students. These materials also do not provide administrators with easily obtainable metrics to measure the performance of classes, teachers, or individual grades in their schools on a regular basis. Increasingly, parents are finding their children coming home with fewer and fewer textbooks and other printed materials because the costs of providing children with materials to take home is simply too costly. 

&#160; 

Limitations of Software Products. As a result of the recognition of the limitations of print-based products and the perceived advantages of computer-based materials, educators began to utilize software-based supplemental materials, such as CD-ROMs. However, these materials also have significant limitations. Software products are designed to run on specific operating systems with specific memory requirements, and require installation on individual computers or costly and time-consuming installations on centralized computer systems. Software products place increased demands on schools&#8217; limited IT personnel, systems, and budgets. Access to these products is typically limited to the computers in a specific classroom or computer lab and cannot be used at home unless schools provide a student with a disk containing the software and the student has access to a computer with the appropriate operating system or ability to play a CD-ROM. Any updates require the publication, receipt, distribution and installation of new software or CD-ROMs, which would require the school and parents to purchase new versions. In addition, software-based products are typically unable to provide real-time feedback about student performance to teachers or educators. CD-ROM&#8217;s are also subject to being illegally duplicated. 

&#160; 

Advantages of Online Learning Solutions. Online products can provide educators and parents with real-time feedback on student progress, allowing for tailored instruction based on individual student or classroom needs, and can generate reports for parents and teachers. Online products also are easily, automatically, and frequently updated with new or more current content, additional features and enhancements and provide students with instant feedback, positive reinforcement and remediation when proficiency levels are not met. Also, unlike software- or CD-ROM- based learning materials, web-based products require no software to be installed in school or home computers and can be accessed anywhere the internet is available. Web-based products can be offered at lower prices as they do not require expenditures for publishing, paper, or electronic media, shipping or warehousing. Web-based products are also becoming increasingly available for Smartphones, Tablets and Ebooks. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe the following are our key competitive strengths: 

&#160; 

Customized, Content. Our line of virtual textbooks and assessment programs offers online, practice and assessments for certain subjects, primarily math in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth grades which we hope to expand to cover all grades and most subjects from first grade through twelfth grade. We believe this customization will be attractive to parents and educators, providing them with a resource that meets their specific state and grade-level teaching needs in a variety of subjects. 

&#160; 

Real-time Student Tracking, Built-in Remediation and Enrichment. In addition to our virtual textbooks, we have designed software that will assess a student&#8217;s progress in learning. We can provide real-time reporting on student achievement, allowing parents and educators the option to quickly identify learning gaps and provide targeted instruction and practice. Our assessment software also provides students with immediate feedback and explanations and, when required, remediation content designed to build foundational skills in order to accelerate students to grade-level proficiency. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Engaging, Fun and Easy to Use for Students. Our products utilize a simple, graphical user interface that we believe to be intuitive and easy to use. In addition, our virtual textbooks and supplementary web-based programs incorporate games and rewards in an attempt to make learning fun and engaging for students. By engaging students and providing them with the tools they need to succeed, we hope to enable them to take control of their own learning, boost their confidence, and keep them interested in using our products, while creating a culture of academic success. 

&#160; 

Accessible, Dynamic Web-based Platform. Our products are delivered online so they can be used by teachers and students on computers wherever internet access is available, such as classrooms, computer labs, media centers, school libraries, public libraries or at home. Our programs are compatible with existing school and home systems and require no additional software, no installation or maintenance and no extensive implementation or training. Moreover, unlike traditional workbooks or software products, our Virtual Learning content is easily and quickly updated whenever content or functionality enhancements are introduced or products are modified due to changes in state standards. 

&#160; 

High Impact, Low Cost Solution. Virtual Learning plans to offer a comprehensive online educational solution on a hosted platform and provides high quality content, assessment, and reporting for core subjects in a wide range of grade levels. At an anticipated annual subscription rate of $29.95 per family, Virtual Learning products are significantly less expensive than competing traditional print, software and online alternatives provided by large education publishers. Initially we plan to offer access to our full range of website based course offerings for free to help build a user base. 

&#160; 

We have designed our software to enable quick modification to any language: We have designed into our software the ability to easily modify and convert its content to any language that we feel there is a market or would be required to meet the requirements of any of our subscriber base. 

&#160; 

We believe increased accountability, including the need for school districts and states to meet the requirements of legislative developments, combined with the increased availability and utilization of web-based technologies by teachers, students, and administrators has resulted in decreased spending on traditional print-based and software-based supplemental materials and increased spending on innovative online programs that offer functionality and real-time assessment and reporting not provided by traditional solutions. 

&#160; 

Our online products are easily and frequently updated with new or more current content, additional features and enhancements and can provide students with instant feedback, positive reinforcement and remediation when proficiency levels are not met. Web-based products require no software to be installed in school or home computers and can be accessed anywhere the internet is available. Web-based products can be offered at lower prices as they do not require expenditures for publishing, paper, or electronic media, shipping or warehousing 

&#160; 

Key Attributes of Our Business Model 

&#160; 

We believe the following are the key attributes of our business model (Please note that NONE of the key attributes of our business model have materialized yet): 

&#160; 

High Revenue Visibility and Strong Cash Flow Generation. We believe we have an attractive business model characterized by a potentially visible recurring revenue stream and high profit margins, neither of which have materialized as of December 31, 2015. We have not yet generated any meaningful revenue and have never generated a profit 

&#160; 

Scalability and Flexibility. We continue to scale our business by increasing our product offerings using our products without incurring significant incremental expense. Our content development process, our flexible sales model and our cost-effective centralized, hosted online delivery platform will allow us to minimize our costs as we expand our product offerings and, hopefully, our business when and if sales develop. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Solution to Various Learning Problems : As a software development company, we have developed our products in direct response to parents and teachers concerns relating to student&#8217;s ability to master all of the material. Our software includes, at present, over fifty modules that teach subjects as diverse as geometry, algebra, measurement, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions, to name a few, This time pressure issue was further substantiated and further reported by such sources as the Education Resources Information Center; through several studies documenting the importance of time needed for learning and time spent in learning as parameters of educational achievement. Several studies have examined differences in student learning rates, amount of information acquired, and amount of information retained in three common types of classroom tasks. Tasks that required knowledge of specific facts; comprehension of basic concepts and principles; or application of facts, concepts, and principles to problem-solving activities. Results of studies indicated large differences among knowledge, comprehension, and application tasks for all measures of student performance. 

&#160; 

Third: Granting access to all of our subscribing students to all of our virtual courses and supplementary material and assessment programs will allow students who are deficient in having mastered content required in a prior classroom module, prior grade or from another school, will give students an opportunity to make up for any deficiencies at his or her own pace and in a non-threatening and non-judgmental environment. Fourth: The software platform we currently use for all of our products is ideally suited to adapt all of our products to any number of languages with minimal programming changes. It is our intention to make all of our products available in the Spanish language. 

&#160; 

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Ability to Implement Growth Initiatives . With regard to the section &#8220; Develop New Products and Enhance our Online Platform&#8221; below, the reference to new products in that section refers to completing the additional titles mentioned below and this process is on-going and the essence of our growth strategy. The completion of the additional titles is the primary goal of the Company during the next year. The main obstacle to achieving the growth strategy initiatives is the fact that at present we have one employee and limited funds. The failure to obtain additional funding elsewhere, would seriously impair or prevent achieving any of the growth strategy initiatives set forth below prior to development. With such funding, prior to developing additional titles we contemplate achieving certain of our growth initiatives or substantial parts of them. For example, with respect to cross platform functionality, while we are in the process of completing the four stages of development for any given title, we are constantly seeking ways to adapt the programming of each title to be operational on as many platforms as possible. By taking into account several other changes our files will play on any standard PC, android cellphone and also play in a video player 

&#160; 

Develop New Products and Enhance our Online Platform. Once we have achieved a revenue stream we intend to develop new products, as well as new features and functionality for our online platform, to address student needs, parents, and teacher requests in order to maintain the competitiveness we feel necessary to maintain growth both in the number of subscribers to our online services and to enable us to increase our per subscriber revenue by offering increased value. The development of new products and the enhancement of our Online Platform to play on various operating systems such as the Apple, Android and Blackberry are relevant to our growth because such development and enhancement improve functionality of content to be viewed over a broader base of communications platforms, e.g. it is now primarily viewed over a Microsoft Windows based desk top or laptop computer over the internet whereas in the future it will be viewable over cellphones and tablets. To date our system is viewable through any Windows computer system over the internet and has been modified to be viewed over any cell phone or tablet using Android operating system. In the future we want to extend this to include the iPhone, iPad and Blackberry. We also want to convert our modules to become a video presentation. 

&#160; 

Continue development in cross platform functionality for mobile telephone systems. As briefly addressed above, in order to address additional subscribers we intend to make our online services available to mobile telephone users. We are currently capable of serving Android Tablet users. We intend to extend this cross platform functionality to iPad and IPhone and Blackberry cell phones. These Smartphones appear to be establishing a significant and increasing market share of the mobile telecommunications business. A Smartphone is a mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary feature phone. Smartphones and feature phones may be thought of as handheld computers integrated with a mobile telephone, but while most feature phones are able to run applications based on platforms such as Java Me a smartphone usually allows the user to install and run more advanced applications. Smartphones run complete operating system software providing a platform for application developers. Thus, they combine the functions of a camera phone and a Personal digital assistant (PDA). The increased availability and utilization of web-based and mobile technologies enhances and supplements teacher instruction, engages today&#8217;s technology-savvy learners and improves student outcomes. Some smartphones, sometimes called NirvanaPhones, have a docking station with an external display and keyboard to create a desktop or laptop environment. Growth in demand for advanced mobile devices boasting powerful processors, abundant memory, larger screens, and open operating systems has outpaced the rest of the mobile phone market for several years. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Develop New Products and Enhance our eBook Platform. Our strategy calls for development of electronic books as an additional source of revenue, additive to revenue coming from online services. An electronic book (also e-book, eBook, digital book) is a text and image-based publication in digital form produced on, published by, and readable on computers or other digital devices. Numerous e-book formats emerged and proliferated, some supported by major software companies such as Adobe with its PDF format, and others supported by independent and open-source programmers. Multiple readers follow multiple formats, most of them specializing in only one format. 

&#160; 

Our flexible web-based distribution model and in-house content development capabilities allow us to continually update and improve our products, make our products immediately available on the World Wide Web regardless of platform and distribute our products in a cost-efficient manner. 

&#160; 

Increasingly tech-savvy students today are increasingly relying on multiple devices and media to access information, through the World Wide Web. As such, it is important to deliver our content in the way that best suits their needs. With 3 Screen access,(PC, Mobile, Tablet) we will open up new distribution channels, extending our reach while making our content conveniently accessible, regardless of time or place. And, since our content is &#8216;always on&#8217;, we may achieve higher numbers of subscribers. In this way we hope that our products will garner the widest possible user audience and hence positively impact our growth. As of December 31, 2015, our primary delivery vehicle are Windows based devices. With the migration to the WordPress platform our online programs we be visible on both Windows, Apple and Blackberry ddevices. 

&#160; 

Expand Into New Related Markets for Further Growth. We believe there is a significant opportunity to utilize our programming language platform to create fully animated, talking, colorful, interactive content for the subject fields of science and reading and sell our products in new geographic and end markets that will enhance our growth. 

&#160; 

We believe there is a significant opportunity to modify the content of our virtual textbooks and related assessment materials into other languages. Bilingual Education is a program used to help limited English proficient (LEP) children keep up with all their required academic competencies, such as math, history and science, while they are learning English through ESL (English as a Second Language) classes. Many LEP students learn to speak conversational English within the first 2 years, but research consistently shows that it takes 4 to 7 years before most students are able to use English to learn academic subjects and perform on a par with native English-speaking peers. A recent national research (Collier &#38; Thomas 1996) shows that late-exit quality bilingual programs actually create the best results, with students in 2-way bilingual programs (bilingual students and native-English speakers learning in 2 languages in the same classroom) out-performing their mainstream peers. Despite what the research is showing, most bilingual education programs transition their students into the mainstream within the first 3 years. 

&#160; 

Bilingual program students continue learning academic subjects like math and science in the language in which they are able to learn most effectively, while learning English. There is always an ESL component to each bilingual program. Uninterrupted development of children&#8217;s cognitive, academic, and linguistic skills is critical in the academic success of limited English proficient students. Moreover, is it not better to build on the assets that the students bring with them- their knowledge, languages and cultures- rather than discouraging the development of those valuable resources. 

&#160; 

Bilingual programs have been proven to be cost effective for school systems to implement for the following reasons: 

&#160; 

1) LEP students who chose bilingual education programs are less likely to be placed into expensive special education programs as those who chose to stay in the sink or swim English-only programs, 2) With the additional support, bilingual education students are less likely to drop out of high school than their language minority peers in English-only programs, 3) Bilingual education helps to nurture and support the continual development of valuable bilingual/bicultural skills that are needed in our global economy. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

There are numerous contributing factors that help explain the desertion of bilingual children and the cultural diverse child. Some of them reside in teenagers themselves, some are institutional, and some are social. Teenagers start questioning the educational system in which their needs are not satisfied. Families pressed by economic needs encourage teenagers to work, because they see education as a very expensive commodity. Pressing economic need impels them to earn a living instead of continuing their education. The exorbitant and rising costs of a college education and misinformation about the opportunities to succeed in college combine to present a bleak future for minority students. The lack of basic skills is another contributing factor. A typical bilingual student lags two years behind his or her classmates, which imprint on them a label that in some cases is very difficult to overcome. Children know who are the good students and are the ones who lack behind. Teenagers feel the alienation and become truants. Truancy makes their stay at school even more difficult. While the students who come to class regularly gain knowledge, the youngsters who are truant fall farther behind, and the gap between their knowledge level and the ideal level becomes greater. 

&#160; 

By addressing bi-lingual educational needs and by translating our online programming and eBooks into other languages we will expand our potential user base and hence promote subscriber and revenue growth. The development of new products and the enhancement of our business by producing product for non-English speakers is relevant to our growth because such development and enhancement aims to expand customer base into new markets to be viewed over a broader base of communications platforms, e.g. it is now primarily viewed over a desk top or laptop computer over the internet whereas in the future it will be viewable over cellphones and tablets, for non-English speakers. To date we have translated third and fourth grade geometry courses into Spanish and in the future we intend to translate all modules into Spanish to expand our market to include more Spanish speaking customers. We also have been having preliminary discussions for marketing Asian language courses again with an eye toward expanding the customer base in the future. 

&#160; 

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

Virtual Learning is an online education company. As of December 31, 2015, we have not begun to accept subscribers. We are making available our courses and virtual textbooks free of charge through our website www.mathisbasic.com in order to create a student user base. We provide instruction through our fully interactive virtual textbooks. Our fully animated, interactive featured, colorful and audio virtual textbooks have combined rigorous content along with a variety of practice problems, activities, assessments, games, and productivity tools that improve the performance of students via proprietary web-based platforms games that engage students, reinforce and reward learning achievement. Our core product line helps students in First through 12th grade, master grade level academic standards in a fun and engaging manner.

Please note that we have only one operational website www.mathisbasic.com . 

&#160; 

When a student logs into our web-based system, the student is granted total access to all subjects regardless of grade. Falling budgets, increased student density per classroom, and what may be perceived by parents and teachers as more demanding learning requirements have only placed a greater burden for the student to keep up. Our virtual textbooks and other learning products may help a student overcome this problem by learning on an individual level and at his or her own rate in a non-threatening, non-judgmental environment. Since it is self-paced and fully contained it allows students to work at an advanced pace as well as provide remedial support. 

&#160; 

Virtual Learning is also a producer and intends to distribute computer software and video educational materials on CD and DVD formatted disks which will be available through various distributors and our websites either as a download or in boxed format. We have opened ecommerce store fronts on Amazon.com, and Barnes and Noble&#8217;s Nook. We have combined rigorous content in math with interactive features and games that engage students, reinforce and reward learning achievement. It is our intention to eventually have all our content available both online and in the CD and DVD formats. However, at present there are some titles that are not available in both formats. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

To date, we have completed 5 titles on CD formatted disks relating to the teaching of basic English to foreign speaking people. These titles include &#8220;English for Russian Speaking People&#8221;; English for Portuguese Speaking People&#8221;; &#8220;English for Spanish Speaking People&#8221;; &#8220;English for Chinese Speaking People&#8221;; and &#8220;English for Polish Speaking People&#8221;.

We are also in preproduction on additional video titles relating to Trigonometry, pre-calculus.. 

&#160; 

Core Educational Principles 

&#160; 

We believe that one of the keys to our success lies in our core educational principles that guide product design and development: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Clear expectations. We have subdivided each grade into approximately twenty four different modules. Each module focuses on an underlying topic which is further explored with rigorous content which has been presented in an in depth, animated, colorful, and interactive format. Our initial presentation starts out with a review of the basic underlying concepts and skills and is patiently and painstaking incremented with all of the content and skills required to be learned and mastered for that particular grade. Clear goals for the student to master the targeted skills or concepts. Each module includes activities and various types of questions to assess the student&#8217;s mastery and progress. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; High quality, rigorous content. We are in the process of building courses from the ground-up, customized to each set of standards for a particular topic. We utilize a scaffolding approach to content development that begins with skill building and then builds to higher level thinking skills. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Fun and engaging assignments. Our virtual textbooks are embedded with short games, an assortment of activities and a variety of question formats to assess the student&#8217;s mastery of the material. These features provide continual positive reinforcement and reward learning to engage students and build student confidence in a non-judgmental and non-threatening environment. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Immediate feedback. Students will receive immediate feedback and explanations for each question and activity, allowing them to learn and quickly apply new knowledge to subsequent questions and to build skills and conceptual understanding in order to handle more complex content that follows. &#160; 

Our Subscribers 

&#160; 

Our target market is the approximately 50 million students that attend school throughout the United States consistingof K-12 and postsecondary education and the approximately 1.5 million students that are being home schooled though out the United States. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Subscriber Support 

&#160; 

Marketing Activities 

&#160; 

When implemented our marketing strategy will be to continually increase our brand and Web-site awareness, to introduce and to continually generate qualified subscriber leads for our web-site. We intend to focus our marketing efforts on individual students and their parents, individual schools, principals, and teachers for sales to both new and existing subscribers. 

&#160; 

Our primary marketing activities will include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Targeted campaigns to individual students and their parents and other family members, schools, and organizations sponsoring after school learning opportunities by using search engine marketing, direct mail, e-mail marketing and print advertisements; participation in tradeshows; building on relationships with satisfied students and parents, organizations, and school subscribers to target new sales to other interested parties in the geographic area; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Webinars for existing subscribers introducing them to new products, add-on features and upgrades; incentives such as free months to attract new subscribers or free trials of add-on products to attract &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Renewals; and we intend to promote ourselves through magazine advertisements describing and offering our virtual textbooks. &#160; 

Subscriber Support 

&#160; 

We will provide our subscribers with service through &#8220;contact us&#8221; via phone, live chat or by email. 

&#160; 

Our Competition As a general matter, we face varying degrees of competition from a variety of education companies because our learning systems encompass many components of the educational development and delivery process. We compete primarily with companies that provide online curriculum and school support services to K-12 virtual and blended public schools, and school districts. Virtual Learning will compete primarily with other providers of supplemental educational materials and online learning tools. 

&#160; 

We believe our principal competitors will include: providers of online and offline supplemental instructional materials for the core subject areas of reading, mathematics, science and social studies for K-12 institutions; companies that provide K-12-oriented software and online-based educational assessment and remediation products and services to students, educators, parents, and educational institutions; the assessment divisions of established education publishers, including Pearson Education, Inc., The McGraw-Hill Companies, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company; providers of online and offline test preparation materials; traditional print textbook and workbook companies that publish K-12 core subject educational materials, standardized test preparation materials or paper and pencil assessment tools; summative assessment companies that have expanded their product lines to include formative assessment and instruction products; non-profit and membership educational organizations and government agencies that offer online and offline products and services, including in some cases at no cost, to assist individuals in standards mastery and test preparation; and providers of website hosting for students, teachers and schools. 

&#160; 

We believe the principal competitive factors in Virtual Learning&#8217;s market will be: quality of content and deep customization to standards; formative assessment and reporting to inform instruction; ease of use, including whether a product is available online; program efficacy and the ability to provide improved student outcomes; ability to engage students; quality of subscriber support; vendor reputation; and price. 

&#160; 

Virtual Learning expects to compete primarily with textbook, workbook, study guide and software product published by the large postsecondary publishers, such as Pearson, McGraw-Hill, Cengage, Wiley, and Mosby (Reed Elsevier). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Concentrations 

&#160; 

We anticipate that the majority of our revenues from the sale of subscriptions and our products and services will occur in North America. 

&#160; 

The Technology 

&#160; 

All of our courses are delivered primarily through an online platform and generally include a significant amount of online content. We employ technology where we feel it is appropriate and can enhance the learning process, with the offline:online ratio changing appropriately for advancing developmental levels in students. In addition to online content, our curriculum includes a rich mix of course materials, including engaging ePub textbooks 

&#160; 

We were using Adobe Flash as the platform upon which to develop our virtual textbooks and CD and DVD formatted educational titles. Adobe Flash had several unique features that make it ideal for our purposes. First, it had the ability to publish our work in several formats including as an executable file which may be played on either a PC or a Macintosh Computer. In additional the same programming may also be used as the basis for presentation on our website with no change in the basic core code. Adobe Flash is especially useful in its ability to incorporate and integrate many forms of media into a single interactive program. 

&#160; 

Adobe Flash was one of the most popular and versatile applications for digital multimedia and website development. The biggest drawback was that Apple and Adobe have not been on friendly terms and have made the adoption of Flash on Apple systems not very user friendly and visible on Apple&#8217;s various iPhone and iTablet devices. Apple has been capturing an increasing percentage of the education market. Apple continues to dominate the market for education tablets. 

&#160; 

On October 28, 2013, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that iPads make up 94 percent of the market for education tablet, a stat that he noted was impressive and unheard of in most businesses. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen a market share that high before,&#8221; Cook said Monday during a conference call with analysts. The company has attempted to push its tablets into the education arena with textbook support and discounts for bulk purchases. Schools represent a potential source of growth at a time when the iPad&#8217;s market share dominance has eroded in the general consumer market. Cook said the education business represented a potential $1 billion market for Apple. Apple on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations, led by strong iPhone sales. But iPad sales of 14.1 million units was short of estimates and flat from a year ago. Apple could see a spike in iPad sales in the next quarter, with consumers likely scrambling to buy the iPad Air, which hits the market on Friday. The iPad Mini with Retina Display is scheduled for later in November. 

&#160; 

As the Internet has become more complex, more easily accessed, and more plentiful in rich media, it has increasingly become a destination for those wanting to be educated and entertained at the same time. Education is a subset of media (online or offline, interactive or not) that presents science, math, history or culture in a compelling and entertaining manner. This is where Flash-based education and entertainment entered the scene. Flash allowed for the creation of nonlinear, self-motivated, educational experiences that feature compelling and powerful use of sound, video, imagery, and interactivity. 

&#160; 

We believe that the conversion of our educational materials to be viewable over various Apple devices is critically important to the continued existence of our Company. We believe that WordPress is the platform to accomplish that goal. Today WordPress has impressive flexibility in terms of Themes and a vast array of plugins that most everything we have accomplished using Flash may be replicated using WordPress and plug-ins that are available. 

&#160; 

WordPress users may be installed with a variety of themes and switch between them. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website and they can be installed without altering the content or health of the site. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present. Every WordPress theme is designed using some standards with structured PHP, valid HTML and CSS. Today, JavaScript and jQuery are being used to add responsiveness to the themes.

Plugins 

&#160; 

WordPress&#8217;s plugin architecture allows users to extend its features. WordPress has over 30,000 plugins available, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs. These customizations range from search engine optimization, to client portals used to display private information to logged in users, to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars. But not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades and as a result they may not function properly or may not function at all.

Mobiles 

&#160; 

Native applications exist for WebOS, Android, iOS (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad), Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. These applications, designed by Automattic, allow a limited set of options, which include adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats. 

&#160; 

Other features 

&#160; 

WordPress also features integrated link management; a search engine&#8211;friendly, clean permalink structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to articles; and support for tagging of posts and articles. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in articles (for example, converting regular quotes to smart quotes). WordPress also supports the Trackback and Pingback standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. 

&#160; 

One of the most important and relevant characteristics of Adobe Flash that we have enjoyed was its ability to present material in almost any language. WordPress provides us with the same flexibility and will allow us to adapt any of our programs to a variety of languages. The language component of the computer program is documented as an image file, which then is displayed independent of the computer user&#8217;s operating system limitations and graphic display limitations. This will allow us to present our content in many languages simultaneously from within the program and not have to worry about the user&#8217;s computer system to display that language.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1 full-time employee who died April 4, 2016. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified resellers and to retain qualified outsourced information system management. To date, we have not been successful in our efforts, and there no assurance that we will be successful in the future. Our late employee was not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
