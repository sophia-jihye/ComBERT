 ITEM 1. Business. 

General 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Form 10-K refer to Guess?, Inc. (&#8220;GUESS?&#8221;) and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

We design, market, distribute and license one of the world&#8217;s leading lifestyle collections of contemporary apparel and accessories for men, women and children that reflect the American lifestyle and European fashion sensibilities. Our apparel is marketed under numerous trademarks including GUESS, GUESS?, GUESS U.S.A., GUESS Jeans, GUESS? and Triangle Design, MARCIANO, Question Mark and Triangle Design, a stylized G and a stylized M, GUESS Kids, Baby GUESS, YES, G by GUESS, GUESS by MARCIANO and Gc. &#32;The lines include full collections of clothing, including jeans, pants, skirts, dresses, shorts, blouses, shirts, jackets, knitwear and intimate apparel. We also selectively grant licenses to manufacture and distribute a broad range of products that complement our apparel lines, including eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids&#8217; and infants&#8217; apparel, outerwear, swimwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories. 

Our products are sold through direct-to-consumer, wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Our core customer is a style-conscious consumer primarily between the ages of 20 and 35. These consumers are part of a highly desirable demographic group that we believe, historically, has had significant disposable income. We also appeal to customers outside this group through specialty product lines that include MARCIANO, a more sophisticated fashion line targeted to women and men, and GUESS Kids, targeted to boys and girls ages 6 to 12. 

We were founded in 1981 and currently operate as a Delaware corporation. 

The Company operates on a 52 / 53 -week fiscal year calendar, which ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 of each year. &#32;All references herein to &#8220;fiscal 2016 ,&#8221; &#8220;fiscal 2015 &#8221; and &#8220;fiscal 2014 &#8221; represent the results of the 52 -week fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 , January 31, 2015 &#32;and February 1, 2014 , respectively. References to &#8220;fiscal 2017 &#8221; represent the 52 -week fiscal year ending January 28, 2017. 

Business Strengths 

We believe we have several business strengths that set us apart from our competition, including: 

Brand Equity. &#160; The GUESS? brand is an integral part of our business, a significant strategic asset and a primary source of sustainable competitive advantage. The GUESS? brand communicates a distinctive image that is fun, fashionable and sexy. We have developed and maintained this image worldwide through our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive product designs and through our award-winning advertising, under the creative leadership and vision of Paul Marciano, our Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Creative Officer. Brand loyalty, name awareness, perceived quality, strong brand images, public relations, publicity, promotional events and trademarks all contribute to the reputation and integrity of the GUESS? brand. 

Global Diversification. &#160; The global success of the GUESS? brand has reduced our reliance on any particular geographic region. This geographic diversification provides broad opportunities for growth, even during regional economic slowdowns. The percentage of our revenue generated from outside of the U.S. has grown from approximately 32% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 to approximately 59% of our total revenues for the year ended January 30, 2016 . As of January 30, 2016 , the Company directly operated 835 &#32;retail stores in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The Company&#8217;s licensees and distributors operated 804 &#32;additional retail stores worldwide. As of January 30, 2016 , the Company and its licensees and distributors operated in 97 &#32;countries worldwide. We continue to evaluate the different businesses in our global portfolio, directing capital investments to those with more profit potential. For instance, we plan to allocate sufficient resources to fuel future growth in Asia, particularly in mainland China, where we see significant opportunities. In addition, we plan to resume expansion of our G by GUESS concept in the Americas and will target overall growth in other markets such as Russia and Turkey where we believe the GUESS? brand is underpenetrated. 

Multiple Store Concepts. &#160; We and our network of licensee partners sell our products around the world primarily through six different store concepts, namely our GUESS? full-price retail stores, our GUESS? factory outlet 

stores, our GUESS? Accessories stores, our G by GUESS stores, our MARCIANO stores and our GUESS? Kids stores. We also have a small number of underwear, Gc watch and footwear concept stores. This allows us to target the various demographics in each region through dedicated store concepts that market each brand or concept specifically to the desired customer population. Having multiple store concepts also allows us to target our newer brands and concepts in different markets than our flagship GUESS? store concept. For instance, we have mall locations for G by GUESS stores where we would not ordinarily operate any of our full-price GUESS? stores. &#32; 

Multiple Distribution Channels. We use direct-to-consumer, wholesale and licensing distribution channels to sell our products. This allows us to maintain a critical balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single channel. The use of multiple channels also allows us to adapt quickly to changes in the distribution environment in any particular region. 

Direct-to-Consumer. Our direct-to-consumer network is omni-channel, made up of both directly operated brick-and-mortar retail stores as well as integrated e-commerce sites that create a seamless shopping experience for our customers with shared product inventories. 

Directly operated retail stores and concessions. As of January 30, 2016 , we directly operated a total of 455 &#32;stores in the U.S. and Canada and 380 &#32;stores outside of the U.S. and Canada, plus an additional 195 &#32;smaller-sized concessions in Asia and Europe. Distribution through our directly operated retail stores and concessions allows us to influence the merchandising and presentation of our products, enhance our brand image, build brand equity and test new product design concepts. As part of our omni-channel initiative, U.S. and Canadian retail store sales may be fulfilled from one of our numerous retail store locations or from our distribution centers. 

e-Commerce. &#32;As of January 30, 2016 , we operated retail websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, South Korea and China. Our websites act as virtual storefronts that both sell our products and promote our brands. Designed as customer shopping centers, these sites showcase our products in an easy-to-navigate format, allowing customers to see and purchase our collections of apparel and accessories. These virtual stores have not only expanded our direct-to-consumer distribution channel, but they have also improved customer relations and are fun and entertaining alternative-shopping environments. Our U.S. and Canadian online sites contain &#8220;find the right fit&#8221; product recommendations and integration with our customer relationship management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) system and loyalty programs. Omni-channel initiatives that we have already deployed in the U.S. and Canada include &#8220;reserve online, pick-up in stores&#8221; and &#8220;order from store&#8221; as well as mobile optimized commerce sites and smartphone applications. In the U.S. and Canada, e-commerce orders may be fulfilled from our distribution centers, or from our retail stores, or both. &#32;We have begun to deploy similar omni-channel strategies in certain international markets, leveraging our existing technology and experience. We have e-commerce available to 52 countries and in seven languages around the world. 

Wholesale Distribution. We sell through both domestic and international wholesale distribution channels as well as licensee operated retail stores and concessions. 

Wholesale. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In North America, our wholesale customers consist primarily of better department stores, including Macy&#8217;s, Bloomingdales, Liverpool and The Bay, and select specialty retailers and upscale boutiques, which have the image and merchandising expertise that we require for the effective presentation of our products. In Europe, our products are sold in stores ranging from large, well known department stores like El Corte Ingl&#232;s, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps &#32;to small upscale multi-brand boutiques. Because our European wholesale business is more fragmented, we generally rely on a large number of smaller regional distributors and agents to distribute our products. Through our foreign subsidiaries and our network of international distributors, our products are also available in major cities throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and Central and South America. 

Licensee stores and concessions. As of January 30, 2016 , our licensees and distributors operated 804 &#32;stores worldwide, plus 247 &#32;smaller-sized licensee operated concessions located in Asia. This licensed retail store and concession approach allows us to expand our international operations with a lower level of capital investment while still closely monitoring store designs and merchandise programs in order to protect the reputation of the GUESS? brand. 

Licensing Operations. The desirability of the GUESS? brand name among consumers has allowed us to selectively expand our product offerings and global markets through trademark licensing arrangements, with minimal capital investment or on-going operating expenses. &#32;Our international licenses and distribution agreements allow for the sale of GUESS? branded products in better department stores and upscale specialty retail stores. We currently have 15 &#32; domestic and international licenses that include eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids&#8217; and infants&#8217; apparel, outerwear, swimwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories; and include licenses for the manufacture of GUESS? branded products in markets which include Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Central America, North America and South America. &#32; 

Business Segments 

The Company&#8217;s businesses are grouped into five &#32;reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: Americas Retail , Europe , Asia , Americas Wholesale &#32;and Licensing . In fiscal 2016, the Company changed the names of its &#8220;North American Retail&#8221; and &#8220;North American Wholesale&#8221; segments to &#8220;Americas Retail&#8221; and &#8220;Americas Wholesale&#8221; to better reflect that these segments are inclusive of its operations in North America as well as Central and South America. There have been no changes to the underlying reporting in either segment. &#32;The Company&#8217;s operating segments are the same as its reportable segments. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings (loss) from operations before restructuring charges, if any. &#32;The Company believes this segment reporting reflects how its five business segments are managed and how each segment&#8217;s performance is evaluated by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker to assess performance and make resource allocation decisions. The Americas Retail &#32;segment includes the Company&#8217;s retail and e-commerce operations in North and Central America and its retail operations in South America. The Europe &#32;segment includes the Company&#8217;s wholesale, retail and e-commerce operations in Europe and the Middle East. The Asia &#32;segment includes the Company&#8217;s retail, e-commerce and wholesale operations in Asia. The Americas Wholesale &#32;segment includes the Company&#8217;s wholesale operations in the Americas. The Licensing &#32;segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. The business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs, which consist of shared costs of the organization, and restructuring charges. These costs are presented separately and generally include, among other things, the following unallocated corporate costs: accounting and finance, executive compensation, facilities, global advertising and marketing, human resources, information technology and legal. 

The following table presents our net revenue and earnings (loss) from operations by segment for the last three fiscal years (dollars in thousands):

In fiscal 2016, the Company changed the names of its &#8220;North American Retail&#8221; and &#8220;North American Wholesale&#8221; segments to &#8220;Americas Retail&#8221; and &#8220;Americas Wholesale&#8221; to better reflect that these segments are inclusive of its operations in North America as well as Central and South America. There have been no changes to the underlying reporting in either segment. 

Additional segment information, together with certain geographical information, is included in Note 17 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein. 

Americas Retail &#32;Segment 

In our Americas Retail segment, we sell our products through a network of directly operated retail and factory outlet stores in the Americas and through our online stores. In fiscal 2016 , our Americas Retail segment accounted for approximately 44.5% &#32;of our revenue and 13.3% &#32;of our earnings from operations. Our Americas Retail stores build brand awareness and contribute to market penetration and the growth of our brand, which also drives e-commerce and licensee sales. This segment benefits from the strength of our brand, the quality of our product assortment, the development of a motivated team of sales professionals to service our customers and provide a favorable shopping experience, quality real estate in high-traffic shopping centers and a diversified mix of store concepts. 

Below is a summary of store statistics for directly operated retail stores in the U.S. and Canada, followed by details regarding each of our store concepts.

GUESS? Retail Stores. Our full-price U.S. and Canada GUESS? retail stores carry a full assortment of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s GUESS? merchandise (and women&#8217;s MARCIANO merchandise in select locations), including most of our licensed product categories. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 785,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 1,500 to 13,500 square feet, with most stores between 4,000 and 5,500 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we opened one new retail store and we closed 18 stores. 

GUESS? Retail Accessories Stores. &#32;Our U.S. and Canada GUESS? retail accessories stores sell GUESS? and MARCIANO labeled accessory products. This concept enables us to utilize a smaller store floor space, dedicated to our full range of accessory products, that can co-exist in the same malls as our other concepts. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 29,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 1,500 to 2,500 square feet, with most stores at 2,000 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we closed three GUESS? retail accessories stores. 

GUESS? Factory Outlet Stores. &#32;Our U.S. and Canada GUESS? factory outlet stores are located primarily in outlet malls generally operating outside the shopping radius of our wholesale customers and our full-price retail stores. These stores sell selected styles of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s GUESS? apparel and accessories at lower price points in addition to certain G by GUESS merchandise in select locations. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 902,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 2,000 to 11,000 square feet, with most stores between 4,500 and 7,000 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we opened ten new factory stores and we closed one store. 

GUESS? Factory Accessories Stores. Our U.S. and Canada GUESS? factory accessories stores sell GUESS? and MARCIANO labeled accessory products and are located primarily in outlet malls. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 59,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 1,000 to 4,000 square feet, with most stores between 2,000 and 2,500 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we opened one new GUESS? factory accessories store and we closed three stores. 

G by GUESS Stores. &#32;Our G by GUESS store concept targets a market demographic that shops price points below our GUESS? retail stores and carries apparel for both men and women and a full line of accessories and footwear. G by GUESS stores have a fresh feel, directed toward a full customer experience, with fashion-forward merchandise. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 317,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 4,000 to 7,000 square feet, with most stores between 4,500 and 5,000 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we closed eight G by GUESS stores. 

MARCIANO Stores. &#32;Our MARCIANO stores in the U.S. and Canada offer a fashion-forward women&#8217;s collection designed for the stylish, trend-setting woman. These stores have higher price points than our traditional GUESS? stores and appeal to a slightly older, more sophisticated customer. As of January 30, 2016 , these stores occupied approximately 119,000 square feet and ranged in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,500 square feet, with most stores between 2,500 and 3,000 square feet. In fiscal 2016 , we closed five MARCIANO stores. 

In addition to the stores described above, as of January 30, 2016 , we also directly operated 38 &#32;stores in Mexico and eight &#32;stores in Brazil through our majority-owned joint ventures, comprised of 31 full-priced GUESS? retail stores, 11 GUESS? factory outlet stores and four GUESS? retail accessories stores. 

e-Commerce. &#32;Our Americas Retail segment also includes our retail websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, including www.guess.com, www.gbyguess.com, www.guessbymarciano.com, www.marciano.com, www.guessfactory.com, www.guesskids.com, www.guess.ca, www.gbyguess.ca, www.guessbymarciano.ca, www.guessfactory.ca and www.guess.mx. These websites operate as virtual storefronts that, combined with our retail stores, provide a seamless shopping experience to the consumer to sell our products and promote our brands. They also provide fashion information and a mechanism for customer feedback while promoting customer loyalty and enhancing our brand identity through interactive content online and through smartphone applications. In the U.S. and Canada, our websites and mobile sites are integrated with our CRM system and loyalty programs. In the U.S. and Canada, e-commerce orders may be fulfilled from our distribution centers, or from our retail stores, or both. 

Europe &#32;Segment 

In our Europe segment, we sell our products through wholesale, retail and e-commerce channels, primarily throughout Europe and the Middle East. In fiscal 2016 , our Europe segment accounted for approximately 33.0% &#32;of our revenues and 45.7% &#32;of our earnings from operations. 

European Wholesale Distribution. Our European wholesale business generally relies on a large number of smaller regional distributors and agents to distribute our products primarily to smaller independent multi-brand boutiques. Our products are also sold directly to large, well known department stores like El Corte Ingl&#232;s, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps . Overall, we have thousands of customers with no single customer representing more than 1% of our consolidated net revenue. The type of customer varies from region to region depending on both the prominence of the GUESS? brand in each region and the dominance of a particular type of retail channel in each region. In countries where the brand is well known, we operate through showrooms where agents and distributors can view our line and place orders. We currently have showrooms in key cities such as Barcelona, Dusseldorf, Florence, Lugano, Munich and Paris. In countries where the brand is less prominent, we may use one large distributor for the entire region. Revenues from sales to our licensee operated stores (see European Retail Network below) are recognized as wholesale sales within our European wholesale operations. We sell both our apparel and certain accessories products under our GUESS? and MARCIANO brand concepts through our wholesale channel, operating primarily through two seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. Generally our Spring/Summer sales campaign is from April to September with the related shipments occurring primarily from November to April . The Fall/Winter sales campaign is from November to April with the related shipments occurring primarily from May to October . The Company&#8217;s goal is to take 

advantage of early-season demand and potential reorders by offering a pre-collection assortment which ships at the beginning of each season. Customers retain the ability to request early shipment of backlog orders or delay shipment of orders depending on their needs. 

European Retail Network. Our European retail network is comprised of a mix of directly operated and licensee operated GUESS? and MARCIANO retail and outlet stores, GUESS? Accessories retail and outlet stores, GUESS? Footwear stores, GUESS? Kids stores and Gc stores. For the year ended January 30, 2016 , we and our partners opened 49 &#32;new stores and closed 51 &#32;stores in Europe and the Middle East, ending the year with 594 &#32;stores, 280 &#32;of which we operated directly and 314 &#32;of which were operated by licensees. This store count does not include 26 &#32;smaller-sized concessions in Europe. During fiscal 2016, we also acquired eight &#32;stores from certain of our European licensees . Our store locations vary country by country depending on the type of locations available. Our typical full-price GUESS? stores generally average 2,100 square feet, MARCIANO stores average approximately 1,400 square feet and GUESS? Accessories stores average approximately 850 square feet. Certain of our European stores require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime store locations. These amounts are paid to landlords or existing lessees in certain circumstances. 

Asia &#32;Segment 

In our Asia segment, we sell our products through retail, e-commerce and wholesale channels throughout Asia. In fiscal 2016 , our Asia segment accounted for approximately 11.0% &#32;of our revenue and 8.6% &#32;of our earnings from operations. Our growth in Asia has been fueled by our businesses in South Korea, where we began operating directly in 2007. We believe there continues to be significant potential in Asia, particularly in mainland China, and plan to allocate sufficient resources to fuel future growth. Our Asia retail business includes both licensee and directly operated stores, including GUESS?, GUESS? Kids, GUESS? Accessories, GUESS? Underwear, G by GUESS, Gc and GUESS? Footwear stores. For the year ended January 30, 2016 , we and our partners opened 49 &#32;new stores and closed 55 &#32;stores in Asia, ending the year with 490 &#32;stores, 54 &#32;of which we operated directly and 436 &#32;of which were operated by licensees or distributors. This store count does not include 416 &#32;smaller-sized apparel and accessory concessions. Concessions are widely used in Asia and generally represent directly managed areas within a department store setting. Our Asia wholesale customer base is comprised primarily of a small number of selected distributors with which we have contractual distribution arrangements. We and our partners have flagship stores in key cities such as Beijing, Seoul and Shanghai, and we have partnered with licensees to develop our business in the second-tier and third-tier cities in this region. 

Americas Wholesale &#32;Segment 

In our Americas Wholesale segment, we sell our products through wholesale channels throughout the Americas and to third party distributors based in Central and South America. Our Americas Wholesale business generally experiences stronger performance from July through November. In fiscal 2016 , our Americas Wholesale segment accounted for approximately 6.8% &#32;of our revenue and 22.7% &#32;of our earnings from operations. Our Americas Wholesale customers consist primarily of better department stores, select specialty retailers and upscale boutiques. As of January 30, 2016 , our products were sold to consumers through 810 major doors in the U.S. and Canada as well as through our customer&#8217;s e-commerce sites. This compares to 926 major doors at January 31, 2015 . These locations include 549 shop-in-shops, an exclusive selling area within a department store that offers a wide array of our products and incorporates GUESS? signage and fixture designs. These shop-in-shops, managed by the department stores, allow us to reinforce the GUESS? brand image with our customers. Many department stores have more than one shop-in-shop, with each one featuring women&#8217;s or men&#8217;s apparel. 

Our Americas Wholesale merchandising strategy is to focus on trend-right products supported by key fashion basics. We have sales representatives in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal, Mexico City and Vancouver who coordinate with customers to determine the inventory level and product mix that should be carried in each store. Additionally, we use merchandise coordinators who work with the stores to ensure that our products are displayed appropriately. During fiscal 2016 , our two &#32; largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately &#32; 3.4% &#32; of our consolidated net revenue . 

Licensing &#32;Segment 

Our Licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the Company. In fiscal 2016 , our licensing segment royalties accounted for approximately 4.7% &#32;of our revenue and 76.0% &#32;of our earnings from operations. 

The desirability of the GUESS? brand name among consumers has allowed us to selectively expand our product offerings and global markets through trademark licensing arrangements, with minimal capital investment or on-going operating expenses. &#32; We currently have 15 &#32; domestic and international licenses that include eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids&#8217; and infants&#8217; apparel, outerwear, swimwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories; and include licenses for the manufacture of GUESS? branded products in markets which include Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Central America, North America and South America. 

Our trademark license agreements customarily provide for a multi-year initial term ranging from three to ten years, with a possible option to renew prior to expiration for an additional multi-year period. The typical license agreement requires that the licensee pay us the greater of a royalty based on a percentage of the licensee&#8217;s net sales of licensed products or a guaranteed annual minimum royalty that typically increases over the term of the license agreement. In addition, several of our key license agreements provide for specified, fixed cash rights payments over and above our normal, ongoing royalty payments. Generally, licensees are required to spend a percentage of the net sales of licensed products for advertising and promotion of the licensed products and in many cases we place the ads on behalf of the licensee and are reimbursed. In addition, to protect and increase the value of our trademarks, our license agreements include strict quality control and manufacturing standards. Our licensing personnel in the U.S., Europe and Asia meet regularly with licensees to ensure consistency with our overall merchandising and design strategies in order to protect the GUESS? trademarks and brand. As part of this process, our licensing department reviews in advance GUESS? third party licensed products, advertising and promotional materials. 

We strategically reposition our existing licensing portfolio by monitoring and evaluating the performance of our licensees worldwide. For instance, between 2005 and 2013, we acquired several of our European apparel licensees. As a result, we now directly manage our adult and children&#8217;s apparel businesses in Europe. From time-to-time, the Company has and may continue to acquire certain retail store locations and/or concessions from its licensees. 

Other 

We evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall strategic initiatives and/or will take advantage of economies of scale. Similarly, when existing investments and alliances no longer align with strategic initiatives or as other circumstances warrant, we will evaluate various exit opportunities. 

In December 2015, we entered into a new majority-owned joint venture in Russia to accelerate our expansion in this country. During fiscal 2014, we entered into a majority-owned joint venture which oversees the development of our retail and wholesale channels in Brazil. During fiscal 2013, we entered into a majority-owned joint venture in Portugal with a licensee partner to further expand in this region and acquired a minority equity interest in a privately-held retail and wholesale apparel company with operations in Europe and the U.S. In fiscal 2010, we entered into majority-owned joint ventures in France and the Canary Islands with licensee partners to open new free standing retail stores in these regions. In 2006, we entered into a majority-owned joint venture to oversee the revitalization and expansion of our retail and wholesale channels in Mexico. 

Design 

GUESS?, G by GUESS and MARCIANO apparel products are designed by their own separate in-house design teams located in the U.S., Italy and South Korea. The U.S. and Italy teams work closely to share ideas for products that can be sold throughout our global markets and are inspired by our GUESS? heritage. Our design teams seek to identify global fashion trends and interpret them for the style-conscious consumer while retaining the distinctive GUESS? image. They travel throughout the world in order to monitor fashion trends and discover new fabrics. These fabrics, together with the trends observed by our designers, serve as the primary source of inspiration for our lines and collections. We also maintain a fashion library consisting of vintage and contemporary garments as another source of creative concepts. In addition, our design teams work closely with members of our sales, merchandising and retail operations teams to further refine our products to meet the particular needs of our markets. 

Advertising and Marketing 

Our advertising, public relations and marketing strategy is designed to promote a consistent high impact image which endures regardless of changing consumer trends. While our advertising promotes products, the primary emphasis is on brand image. 

Since our inception, Paul Marciano, our Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Creative Officer, has had principal responsibility for the GUESS? brand image and creative vision. Under the direction of Mr. Marciano, our Los Angeles-based advertising department is responsible for overseeing all worldwide advertising. Throughout our history, we have maintained a high degree of consistency in our advertisements by using similar themes and images, including our signature black and white print advertisements and iconic logos. 

We deploy a variety of media focused on national and international contemporary fashion/beauty, lifestyle and celebrity outlets. In recent years, we have also expanded our media efforts into digital advertising platforms including leading fashion and beauty websites, Facebook, Twitter and global search engines. Our smartphone application provides a unique mobile media experience by combining fashion, e-commerce, personalized product recommendations, targeted promotions and social loyalty rewards to drive mobile brand engagement. 

We also require our licensees and distributors to invest a percentage of their net sales of licensed products and net purchases of GUESS? products in Company-approved advertising, promotion and marketing. By retaining control over our advertising programs, we are able to maintain the integrity of our brands while realizing substantial cost savings compared to outside agencies. 

We will continue to regularly assess and implement marketing initiatives that we believe will build brand equity and grow our business by investing in marketing programs to build awareness and drive customer traffic to our stores, websites and smartphone application. We plan to further strengthen communications with customers through an emphasis on digital marketing, and through our websites, loyalty programs, direct catalog and marketing mailings. We also plan to strengthen communities on various social media platforms, which enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our history, products, special events, promotions and store locations, and allow us to receive and respond directly to customer feedback. 

As part of these initiatives, we currently have loyalty programs mainly in North America with over ten million members covering four of our brands. These programs reward our members who earn points for purchases that can be redeemed on future purchases. We also use these programs to promote new products to our customers which in turn increases traffic in the stores and online. We believe that the loyalty programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing brands. We continue to enhance our loyalty program offerings and strategically market to this large and growing customer base. 

Global Sourcing and Supply Chain 

We source products through numerous suppliers, many of whom have established long-term relationships with us. We seek to achieve efficient and timely delivery of our products, combining global and local sourcing. Almost all of our products are acquired as package purchases where we design and source product and the vendor delivers the finished product. 

In fiscal 2016 , we continued to execute our strategy of deploying a global sourcing and product development plan to support worldwide growth in our e-commerce, retail and wholesale channels. Key activities in global sourcing included our continued efforts to streamline our vendor base and optimize vendor proximity to our main markets. We believe that our balanced global supply chain, with deep vendor partnerships, provides us with a competitive advantage where we have the flexibility to respond to increased demand throughout the world. Our sourcing strategy provides us with the opportunity to leverage costs and improve speed-to-market. 

As an ongoing strategic initiative, we leave a larger portion of our buys open prior to each season to improve the efficiency of our speed-to-market by allowing us to design and produce closer to market delivery . This allows us to better react to emerging fashion trends in the market. We also plan to shorten our lead times through partnering with our suppliers, exercising agility in the production process and continuously searching for new suppliers and sourcing opportunities in reaction to the latest trends. &#32;Additionally, offering an assortment of global core products continues to be an area of focus. As a global brand, we maintain skilled sourcing teams in North America, Europe and Asia. 

We are committed to sourcing our products in a responsible manner, respecting both the countries in which we conduct business and the business partners that produce our products. As a part of this commitment, we have implemented a global social compliance program that applies to our business partners. Although local customs vary in different regions of the world, we believe that the issues of business ethics, human rights, health, safety and environmental stewardship transcend geographical boundaries. 

To support and ensure our social compliance, we communicate our expectations to our partners throughout our global supply chain and conduct compliance audits. If deficiencies are discovered, personnel in each region are empowered to work with the respective business partner to take a corrective course of action. Additionally, the goal of this process is to educate individuals, build strategic relationships and improve business practices over the long-term. 

Quality Control 

Our quality control program is designed to ensure that products meet our high quality standards. We test the quality of our raw materials prior to production and inspect prototypes of each product before production runs commence. We also perform random in-line quality control checks during and after production before the garments leave the contractor. Final random inspections occur when the garments are received in our distribution centers. We believe that our policy of inspecting our products is important to maintain the quality, consistency and reputation of our products. 

Logistics 

We utilize distribution centers at strategically located sites. The Company&#8217;s U.S. distribution center is based in Louisville, Kentucky. At this 506,000 &#32;square-foot facility, we use fully integrated and automated distribution systems. The bar code scanning of merchandise and distribution cartons, together with radio frequency communications, provide timely, controlled, accurate and instantaneous updates to the distribution information systems. Distribution of our products in Canada is handled primarily from a Company operated distribution center in Montreal, Quebec. &#32; Distribution of our products in Europe is handled primarily through a third party distribution center in Piacenza, Italy . &#32;Additionally, we utilize several third party operated distribution warehouses in Hong Kong, South Korea and China that service the Asia region. 

Competition 

The apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented and is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences. We believe that our success depends in large part upon our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner and upon the continued appeal to consumers of the GUESS? brand. We compete with numerous apparel manufacturers and distributors, both domestically and internationally, as well as several well-known designers. Our retail and factory outlet stores face competition from other retailers. Our licensed apparel and accessories also compete with a substantial number of well-known brands. Although the level and nature of competition differ among our product categories and geographic regions, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a global lifestyle brand on the basis of our global brand image and wide product assortment comprising both apparel and accessories. We also believe that our geographic diversification, multiple distribution channels and multiple store concepts help to set us apart from our competition. 

Information Systems 

We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position and support our strategic objectives and we continue to invest in and update computer hardware, system applications and networks. Our computer information systems consist of a full range of financial, distribution, merchandising, point-of-sales, customer relationship management, supply chain and other systems. During fiscal 2016 , we continued to enhance our financial and operational systems globally to align with our global IT standards, accommodate future growth and provide operating efficiencies. Key initiatives included the further development of mobile-based initiatives to support both our wholesale and retail businesses, various multi-channel initiatives and continued enhancements of our product lifecycle management system to facilitate vendor collaboration and increase the efficiency of the supply chain. 

Trademarks 

We own numerous trademarks, including GUESS, GUESS?, GUESS U.S.A., GUESS Jeans, GUESS? and Triangle Design, MARCIANO, Question Mark and Triangle Design, a stylized G and a stylized M, GUESS Kids, Baby GUESS, YES, G by GUESS, GUESS by MARCIANO and Gc. &#32;As of January 30, 2016 , we had approximately 4,600 U.S. and internationally registered trademarks or trademark applications pending with the trademark offices in approximately 184 countries around the world, including the U.S. From time-to-time, we adopt new trademarks in connection with the marketing of our product lines. We consider our trademarks to have significant value in the marketing of our products and act aggressively to register and protect our trademarks worldwide. 

Like many well-known brands, our trademarks are subject to infringement. We have staff devoted to the monitoring and aggressive protection of our trademarks worldwide. 

Wholesale Backlog 

We generally receive orders for fashion apparel three to six months prior to the time the products are delivered to our customers&#8217; stores. The backlog of wholesale orders at any given time is affected by various factors, including seasonality, cancellations, the scheduling of market weeks, the timing of the receipt of orders and the timing of the shipment of orders and may include orders for multiple seasons. Accordingly, a comparison of backlogs of wholesale orders from period-to-period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. 

U.S. and Canada Backlog. Our U.S. and Canadian wholesale backlog as of March 21, 2016 , consisting primarily of orders for fashion apparel, was $51.4 million in constant currency, compared to $59.2 million at March 23, 2015 , a decrease of 13.1%. 

Europe Backlog. As of March 20, 2016 , the European wholesale backlog was &#8364;198.3 million, compared to &#8364;202.3 million at March 22, 2015 , a decrease of 2.0%. The backlog as of March 20, 2016 &#32;is comprised of sales orders for the Spring/Summer 2016 &#32;and Fall/Winter 2016 &#32;seasons. 

Employees 

As of February 2016 , we had approximately 13,500 associates, both full and part-time, consisting of approximately 7,600 in the U.S. and 5,900 in foreign countries. The number of our employees fluctuates during the year based on seasonal needs. In some international markets, local laws provide for employee representation by organizations similar to unions and some of our international employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good. 

Environmental Matters 

We and our licensing partners and suppliers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects (such as emissions to air, discharges to water, and the generation, handling, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes). We are also subject to laws, regulations and ordinances that impose liability for the costs of clean up or other remediation of contaminated property, including damages from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or wastes, in certain circumstances without regard to fault. Certain of our operations and those of our licensing partners and suppliers routinely involve the handling of chemicals and wastes, some of which are or may become regulated as hazardous substances. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any significant expenditures or liabilities for environmental matters. As a result, we believe that our environmental obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

During fiscal 2016, we also published our first corporate sustainability report to mark the formal start of our sustainability program. This report covers important issues such as labor and human rights, employee engagement, respect for the environment, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. These issues have always been important to the Company and will be of increasing importance as we actively monitor, work to improve upon and publicly report on these areas.
