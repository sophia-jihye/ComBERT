 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

ApolloMed is a patient-centered, physician-centric integrated population health management company working to provide coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner. Led by a management team with over a decade of experience, ApolloMed has built a company and culture that is focused on physicians providing high-quality medical care, population health management and care coordination for patients, particularly senior patients and patients with multiple chronic conditions. We believe that ApolloMed is well-positioned to take advantage of changes in the rapidly evolving U.S. healthcare industry, as there is a growing national movement towards more results-oriented healthcare centered on the triple aim of patient satisfaction, high-quality care and cost efficiency.

&#160;

We implement and operate innovative health care models to create a patient-centered, physician-centric experience. ApolloMed has the following integrated, synergistic operations:

&#160;

&#183; Hospitalists, which includes our contracted physicians who focus on the delivery of comprehensive medical care to hospitalized patients; &#160;

&#183; An accountable care organization (&#8220;ACO&#8221;), which focuses on providing high-quality and cost-efficient care to Medicare fee-for-service patients; &#160;

&#183; An independent practice association (&#8220;IPA&#8221;), which contracts with physicians and provides care to Medicare, Medicaid, commercial and dual-eligible patients on a risk- and value-based fee basis; &#160;

&#183; Three clinics, which we own or operate, and which provide specialty care in the greater Los Angeles area; &#160;

&#183; Palliative care, home health and hospice services, which include our at-home and end-of-life services; and &#160;

&#183; A cloud-based population health management IT platform which was placed into service in April 2016, and includes digital care plans, a case management module, connectivity with multiple healthcare tracking devices and also integrates clinical data. &#160;

ApolloMed operates in one reportable segment, the healthcare delivery segment. Our revenue streams, which are described in greater detail below in &#8220;Our Revenue Streams and Our Business Operations,&#8221; are diversified among our various operations and contract types, and include:

&#160;

&#183; Traditional fee-for-service reimbursement; and &#160;

&#183; Risk and value-based contracts with health plans, third party IPAs, hospitals and the Medicare Shared Savings Program (&#8220;MSSP&#8221;) sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), which are the primary revenue sources for our hospitalists, ACO, IPAs and palliative care operations. &#160;

ApolloMed serves Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organization (&#8220;HMO&#8221;) and uninsured patients primarily in California. We provide services to patients, the majority of whom are covered by private or public insurance, with a small portion of our revenue from non-insured patients. We provide care coordination services to each major constituent of the healthcare delivery system, including patients, families, primary care physicians, specialists, acute care hospitals, alternative sites of inpatient care, physician groups and health plans.

&#160;

Our mission is to transform the delivery of healthcare services in the communities we serve by implementing innovative population health models and creating a patient-centered, physician-centric experience in a high performance environment of integrated care.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The original business owned by ApolloMed was ApolloMed Hospitalists (&#8220;AMH&#8221;), a hospitalist company, which was incorporated in California in June 2001, and which began operations at Glendale Memorial Hospital. Through a reverse merger, ApolloMed became a publicly held company in June 2008. ApolloMed was initially organized around the admission and care of patients at inpatient facilities such as hospitals. We have grown our inpatient strategy by providing high-quality care and innovative solutions for our hospital and managed care clients.

&#160;

In 2012, we formed an ACO, ApolloMed Accountable Care Organization, Inc. (&#8220;ApolloMed ACO&#8221;), and an IPA, Maverick Medical Group, Inc. (&#8220;MMG&#8221;). In 2013, we expanded our service offering to include integrated inpatient and outpatient services through MMG.

&#160;

In 2014, we added several complementary operations by acquiring (either directly or through affiliated entities that are wholly-owned by Dr. Hosseinion, as nominee shareholder on behalf of ApolloMed) AKM Medical Group, Inc. (&#8220;AKM&#8221;), an IPA, outpatient primary care and specialty clinics and hospice/palliative care and home health entities. During fiscal 2016, we combined the operations of AKM into those of MMG.

&#160;

Our largest acquisition to date, which was through an affiliate wholly-owned by Dr. Hosseinion, as nominee shareholder on behalf of ApolloMed, was Southern California Heart Centers (&#8220;SCHC&#8221;), a specialty clinic that focuses on cardiac care and diagnostic testing. SCHC has a management services agreement with Apollo Medical Management, Inc. (&#8220;AMM&#8221;), pursuant to which AMM manages all non-medical services for SCHC and has exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to the ongoing business operations of SCHC.

&#160;

In January 2016, we formed Apollo Care Connect, Inc. (&#8220;Apollo Care Connect&#8221;) which acquired certain technology and other assets of Healarium, Inc., which provides us with a population health management platform that includes digital care plans, a case management module, connectivity with multiple healthcare tracking devices and the ability to integrate with multiple electronic health records to capture clinical data.

&#160;

We operate through the following subsidiaries:

&#160;

&#183; AMM &#183; Pulmonary Critical Care Management, Inc. (&#8220;PCCM&#8221;) &#183; Verdugo Medical Management, Inc. (&#8220;VMM&#8221;); &#183; ApolloMed ACO; &#183; Apollo Palliative Care Services, LLC (&#8220;ApolloMed Palliative&#8221;); and &#183; Apollo Care Connect. &#160;

AMM, PCCM and VMM each operates as a physician practice management company and is in the business of providing management services to physician practice corporations under long-term management service agreements, pursuant to which AMM, PCCM or VMM, as applicable, manages certain non-medical services for the physician group and has exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to ongoing business operations.

&#160;

Through AMM, we manage our affiliated physician groups, which consist of:

&#160;

&#183; AMH &#183; MMG; and &#183; SCHC. &#160;

Our physician network consists of hospitalists, primary care physicians and specialist physicians primarily through ApolloMed's owned and affiliated physician groups.

&#160;

Through PCCM we manage Los Angeles Lung Center (&#8220;LALC&#8221;), and through VMM we manage Eli Hendel, M.D., Inc. (&#8220;Hendel&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

ApolloMed has a controlling interest in ApolloMed Palliative, which owns two Los Angeles-based companies, Best Choice Hospice Care LLC (&#8220;BCHC&#8221;) and Holistic Care Home Health Care Inc. (&#8220;HCHHA&#8221;). Our palliative care services focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.

&#160;

The management agreements that AMM, PCCM and VMM enter into with physician groups generally provide for management fees that are recognized as earned based on a percentage of revenues or cash collections generated by the physician practices. Additionally, under each of AMM&#8217;s management agreements, the management fee and services provided are reviewed annually and the management fee is adjusted as necessary to reflect the fair market value of AMM&#8217;s services.

&#160;

On February 17, 2015, we entered into a long-term management services agreement (the &#8220;Bay Area MSA&#8221;) with a hospitalist group located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under the Bay Area MSA, we provide certain business administrative services, including accounting, human resources management and supervision of all non-medical business operations. We have evaluated the impact of the Bay Area MSA and have determined that it triggers variable interest entity accounting, which requires the consolidation of the hospitalist group into our consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

During fiscal 2016, we disposed of substantially all the assets of ApolloMed Care Clinic (&#8220;ACC&#8221;). ACC was a clinic providing care in the Los Angeles area.

&#160;

ApolloMed ACO participates in the MSSP, the goal of which is to improve the quality of patient care and outcomes through more efficient and coordinated approach among providers.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 700 North Brand Blvd., Suite 1400, Glendale, California 91203 and our telephone number is (818) 396-8050.

&#160;

ApolloMed was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 1, 1985 under the name of McKinnely Investment, Inc. On November 5, 1986 McKinnely Investment, Inc. changed its name to Acculine Industries, Incorporated and Acculine Industries, Incorporated changed its name to Siclone Industries, Incorporated on May 24, 1988. On July 3, 2008, Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. merged into Siclone Industries, Incorporated and Siclone Industries, Incorporated, as the surviving entity from the merger, simultaneously changed its name to Apollo Medical Holdings Inc. ApolloMed&#8217;s telephone number is (818) 396-8050 and its website URL is http://apollomed.net.

&#160;

OUR INDUSTRY 

&#160;

U.S. healthcare spending has increased steadily over the past 20 years. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Spending (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), the estimated total U.S. healthcare expenditures are expected to grow by 5.8% for 2014 through 2024, comprising 19.6% of the U.S. gross domestic product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) by 2024. CMS projects total U.S. national health spending to grow 5.3% in 2015 and peak at 6.3% in 2020.

&#160;

These spending increases have been driven, in part, by the aging baby boomer generation; lack of a healthy lifestyle on the part of the general population, both in terms of diet and exercise; rapidly increasing costs in medical technology and pharmaceutical research; the steady growth of the U.S. population; and provider reimbursement structures Additionally, as the healthcare exchanges under the ACA and Medicaid expansions become operational, healthcare spending is projected to increase even more.

&#160;

Hospitalists 

&#160;

&#8220;Hospitalist&#8221; is the term used for doctors who are specialized in the care of patients in the hospital. This movement was initiated over a decade ago and has evolved due to many factors. These factors include:

&#160;

&#183; convenience; &#183; efficiency; &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; financial strains on primary care doctors; &#183; patient safety; &#183; cost-effectiveness for hospitals; and &#183; need for more specialized and coordinated care for hospitalized patients. &#160;

Hospital care expenditures represent the largest segment of U.S. healthcare industry spending. According to CMS estimates, total hospital spending is anticipated to have grown to 4.4% in 2014, reaching $978.3 billion, which is similar to the 2013 rate of 4.3%. In 2015, hospital spending is projected to increase 5.4% due to the continued effects of ACA insurance expansion, combined with the effect of faster economic growth. For 2016 through 2024, continued population aging combined with the improved economic conditions are expected to result in projected average annual growth of 6.1%.

&#160;

Hospitalists assume the inpatient care responsibilities that are otherwise provided by the patient&#8217;s primary care physician or other attending physician and are reimbursed by third parties using the same visit-based or procedural billing codes as are used by the primary care physician or attending physician.

&#160;

Hospitalists focus exclusively on inpatient care without the distraction of outpatient care responsibilities. Additionally, by practicing each day in the same facility, hospitalists perform consistent functions, interact regularly with the same specialists and other healthcare professionals and become accustomed to specific and unique hospital processes, which can result in greater efficiency, less process variability and better patient outcomes. Finally, hospitalists manage the treatment of a large number of patients with similar clinical needs and therefore develop practice expertise in both the diagnosis and treatment of common conditions that require hospitalization. For these reasons, we believe that hospitalists generate operating and cost efficiencies and produce better patient outcomes. Hospitalists have an increasingly important role in pushing quality through readmission prevention, infection control, electronic health records use, patient experience scores, core measures, and appropriate use of order sets.

&#160;

According to the Society of Hospital Medicine, the number of hospitalists has grown over the past decade from a few hundred to more than 44,000 at the end of 2014, making it one of the fastest-growing medical specialties in the U.S. The percentage of hospitals using hospitalists has risen from 29% in 2003 to 50% in 2007 to 72% in 2014.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, we provided hospitalist, intensivist and physician advisor services at over 20 hospitals in Southern and Central California, and had contracts with over 50 IPAs, medical groups, health plans and hospitals.

&#160; 

IPAs 

&#160;

An IPA is an association of independent physicians, or other organization that contracts with independent physicians, and provides services to managed care organizations on a negotiated per capita rate, flat retainer fee, or negotiated fee-for-service (&#8220;FFS&#8221;) basis.

&#160;

Medicare 

&#160;

The Medicare program was established in 1965 and became effective in 1967 as a federally-funded U.S. health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, and it was later expanded to include individuals with end-stage renal disease and certain disabled persons, regardless of income or age. Initially, Medicare was offered only on an FFS basis. Under the Medicare FFS payment system, an individual can choose any licensed physician enrolled in Medicare and use the services of any hospital, healthcare provider or facility certified by Medicare. CMS reimburses providers, based on a fee schedule, if Medicare covers the service and CMS considers it medically necessary.

&#160;

Growth in Medicare spending is expected to continue to increase due to population demographics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1970 to 2014, overall U.S. population grew 54%, while the number of Medicare enrollees grew by more than 140% over the same period. Medicare Beneficiaries as a Share of Total Population grew from 15% in 2011 to 17% in 2015. By the year 2030, the number of these elderly persons is expected to climb to 72.8 million, or 20% of the total U.S. population. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than two million people turn 65 in the U.S. each year.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Medicare Advantage is a Medicare health plan program developed and administered by CMS as an alternative to the traditional FFS Medicare program. Medicare Advantage plans contract with CMS to provide benefits to beneficiaries for a fixed premium per member per month (&#8220;PMPM&#8221;). According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2013, Medicare Advantage represented only 28% of total Medicare members, creating a significant opportunity for additional Medicare Advantage penetration of newly eligible seniors. The share of Medicare beneficiaries in such plans has risen rapidly in recent years; it reached approximately 31% by the end of open enrollment period in 2016 from approximately 13% in 2004. The reasons for this include that plan costs can be significantly lower than the corresponding cost for beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare FFS program, and plans typically provide extra benefits and provide preventive care and wellness programs.

&#160;

Many health plans subcontract a significant portion of the responsibility for managing patient care to integrated medical systems such as ApolloMed. These integrated healthcare systems, whether medical groups or IPAs, offer a comprehensive medical delivery system and sophisticated care management know-how and infrastructure to more efficiently provide for the healthcare needs of the population enrolled with that health plan. Reimbursement models for these arrangements vary around the country. In California, health plans typically prospectively pay the IPA or medical group a fixed PMPM, or capitation payment, which is often based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to IPAs or medical groups, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the IPA manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that IPA. Those IPAs or medical groups that manage care-related expenses under the capitated levels will realize an operating profit; if care-related expenses exceed projected levels, the IPA will realize an operating deficit.

&#160;

Integrated healthcare delivery companies such as ApolloMed can utilize their medical care and quality management strategies and interventions for potential high cost cases and aggressively manage them to improve the health of its population and therefore lower costs for these patients. Additionally, IPAs and medical groups such as MMG have established physician performance metrics that allow them to monitor quality and service outcomes achieved by participating physicians in order to reward efficient, high quality care delivered to members and to initiate improvement efforts for physicians whose results can be enhanced.

&#160;

ApolloMed provides managed care services through its MMG IPAs, and has entered into capitation agreements with health plans, either directly or through a management service organization (&#8220;MSO&#8221;).

&#160; 

Medicaid 

&#160;

Medicaid is a Federal entitlement program administered by the states that provides healthcare and long-term care services and support to low-income Americans. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the Federal government. The Federal government guarantees matching funds to states for qualifying Medicaid expenditures based on each state&#8217;s Federal medical assistance percentage, which is calculated annually and varies inversely with the average personal income in the state. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates and program administration within Federal guidelines. In an effort to improve quality and provide more uniform and cost-effective care, many states have implemented Medicaid managed care programs to improve access to coordinated care, to improve preventive care and to control healthcare costs. Under Medicaid managed care programs, a health plan receives capitation payments from the state. The health plan then arranges for healthcare services to be provided by contracting either directly with providers or with IPAs and medical groups, such as MMG. MMG has entered into capitation agreements with health plans, either directly or through an MSO.

&#160; 

Commercial 

&#160;

Patients enrolled in health plans offered through their employers are generally referred to as commercial members. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2014 approximately 55.4% of non-elderly U.S. citizens received their healthcare benefits through their employers, which contracted with health plans to administer these healthcare benefits. Nationally, commercial employer-sponsored health plan enrollment was approximately 175 million in 2014.

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Dual Eligibles 

&#160;

A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles, meaning that they are low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. Based on CMS estimates, there are approximately 10.7 million dual eligible enrollees with annual spending of approximately $285 billion. Only a small percentage of the total spending on dual eligibles is administered by managed care organizations. Dual eligibles tend to consume more healthcare services due to their tendency to have more chronic conditions. In some states, dual eligible patients are being voluntarily enrolled and/or auto-assigned into managed care programs. About 1.1 million low-income seniors and people with disabilities in California receive health care services through both the Medicare and Medi-Cal (Medicaid nationally) programs. Eight counties are participating in the duals pilot program begun in 2014, known as Cal MediConnect. The participating counties are Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Mateo, Orange, Alameda, Riverside, and Los Angeles Counties, with a total of not more than 456,000 participants and a cap of 200,000 participants in Los Angeles County. As of February, 2016, California&#8217;s demonstration had enrollment of over 128,000 beneficiaries. 

&#160; 

Health Reform Acts 

&#160;

In an effort to reduce the number of uninsured and intending to control healthcare expenditures, President Obama signed the ACA in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Health Reform Acts&#8221;) into law in March 2010. The Health Reform Acts seek a reduction of up to 32 million uninsured individuals by 2019, while potentially increasing Medicaid coverage by up to 16 million individuals and net commercial coverage by 16 million individuals. CMS projects that the total number of uninsured Americans will fall to 23 million by 2023 from 45 million in 2012. The current enrollment numbers (as of February 2016) are roughly 20 million total between the ACA between the Marketplace. The uninsured rate remains at an all-time low with 9.1% of under 65 uninsured as of 4th quarter 2015 according to CDC.Gov data. This represents a significant new market opportunity for health plans and integrated healthcare delivery companies.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, MMG delivered services to nearly 14,500 members through a network of over 140 primary care physicians and over 380 specialist physicians.

&#160;

ACOs 

&#160;

One provision of the Health Reform Acts required CMS to establish an MSSP that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs, which, as described below, are eligible to participate in some of the savings generated by such ACOs. The Medicare FFS program was designed for beneficiaries in the Medicare FFS program, which covers approximately 72% of Medicare recipients, or approximately 36 million eligible Medicare beneficiaries. CMS established the MSSP to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care and reduce unnecessary costs. Eligible providers, hospitals and suppliers may participate in the MSSP by creating an ACO and then applying to CMS. MSSP ACOs must have at least 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries in order to be eligible to participate in the program.

&#160;

The MSSP is designed to improve beneficiary outcomes and increase value of care by (1) promoting accountability for the care of Medicare FFS beneficiaries; (2) requiring coordinated care for all services provided under Medicare FFS; and (3) encouraging investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes. The MSSP rewards ACOs that lower their healthcare costs while meeting performance standards on quality of care and patient satisfaction. Under the final MSSP rules, Medicare will continue to pay individual providers and suppliers for specific items and services as it currently does under the FFS payment system. The MSSP rules require CMS to develop a benchmark for savings to be achieved by each ACO if the ACO is to receive shared savings. An ACO that meets the program&#8217;s quality performance standards will be eligible to receive a share of the savings to the extent its assigned beneficiary medical expenditures are below the medical expenditure benchmark provided by CMS. A minimum savings rate (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) must be achieved before the ACO can receive a share of the savings. Once the MSR is surpassed, all the savings below the benchmark provided by CMS will be shared 50% with the ACO. The MSR varies depending on the number of patients assigned to the ACO, starting at 3.9% for ACOs with patients totaling 5,000 and increasing to 2% for ACOs with more than 60,000 patients. The MSSP program is an all-or-nothing system, that is, an ACO either earns all of its allocable savings or none of it. In performance year 2014 (fiscal 2016), we did not receive an MSSP payment from CMS. Although we exceeded our total benchmark expenditures, generating $3.9 million in total savings and achieving an ACO Quality Score of 90.4% on its Quality Performance Report, CMS determined that we did not meet the minimum savings threshold in performance year 2014 and therefore did not receive the &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; annual shared savings payment in fiscal 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

CMS assigns a beneficiary to the preliminary roster of an ACO if the ACO physicians billed for a &#8220;plurality&#8221; of services during the calendar year preceding the performance period. A plurality means the ACO physicians provided a greater proportion of primary care services, measured in terms of allowed charges, than the physicians in any other ACO or Medicare-enrolled tax identification number. CMS sets the benchmark for each ACO using the historical medical costs of the beneficiaries assigned to the ACO. Under the final MSSP rules, primary care physicians may only join one ACO, unless they have more than one Medicare tax identification number.

&#160;

Palliative Care; Home Health and Hospice Organizations 

&#160; 

Hospice companies serve terminally ill patients and their families. Comprehensive management of the healthcare services and products needed by hospice patients and their families are provided through the use of an interdisciplinary team. Depending upon a patient&#8217;s needs, each hospice patient is assigned an interdisciplinary team comprised of a physician, nurse(s), home health aide(s), social worker(s), chaplain, dietary counselor and bereavement coordinator, as well as other care professionals. Hospice services are provided primarily in the patient&#8217;s home or other residence, such as an assisted living residence or nursing home, or in a hospital. Medicare&#8217;s hospice benefit is designed for patients expected to live six months or less. Hospice services for a patient can continue, however, for more than six months, as long as the patient remains eligible as reflected by a physician&#8217;s certification.

&#160;

Home health care companies provide direct home nursing and therapy services in addition to nutrition and disease management education. These services are provided by licensed and Medicare-certified skilled nurses and other paraprofessional nursing personnel.

&#160;

OUR OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

Hospitalists 

&#160;

Through our affiliated physician group, AMH, we:

&#160;

&#183; Provide admission, daily rounding and discharge of patients at acute care hospitals and long-term acute hospitals for health plans, hospitals and IPAs &#160;

&#183; Evaluate patients in the emergency room to determine if they may be safely discharged to home, a skilled nursing facility or other facility &#160;

&#183; Provide physician advisor consultative services for hospitals, which entails meeting daily with hospital case managers to review the charts, lab studies and imaging studies of hospitalized patients to determine if they meet criteria for continued stay in the hospital, to determine observation versus inpatient status and to evaluate proper coding &#160;

&#183; Provide intensivist/ICU services for hospitals &#160;

&#183; Provide out-of-network to in-network transfers of patients for health plans and IPAs &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

IPA 

&#160;

Our IPA is a network of independent primary care physicians and specialists who collectively care for HMO patients under either a capitated payment or FFS arrangement. Under the capitated model, an HMO pays our IPA a PMPM rate, or a &#8220;capitation&#8221; payment, and then assigns our IPAs the responsibility for providing the physician services required by the applicable patients. The physicians in our IPA are exclusively in control of, and responsible for, all aspects of the practice of medicine for our patients. Our IPA enters into contracts with HMOs, either directly or through a risk-shifting arrangement with MSOs, to provide physician services to enrollees of the HMOs. Most of the HMO agreements have an initial term of two years renewing automatically for successive one-year terms. The HMO agreements generally provide for a termination by the HMOs for cause at any time, although we have never experienced a termination. The HMO agreements generally allow either party to terminate the HMO agreements without cause with a four to six month notice.

&#160;

&#183; Through our IPA, we provide the following services: &#160;

&#183; Physician recruiting &#160;

&#183; Physician contracting &#160;

&#183; Medical management, including utilization management and quality assurance &#160;

&#183; Provider relations &#160;

&#183; Member services, including annual wellness evaluations &#160;

&#183; Education of physicians on proper coding &#160;

&#183; Data collection and analysis &#160;

&#183; Pre-negotiating contracts with specialists, labs, imaging centers, nursing homes and other vendors &#160;

One of our IPA entered into an agreement with an (&#8220;MSO&#8221;), to receive 98% of the gross revenue received for all enrollees attributable to us during the term of the PSA and we are responsible for all medical services required by the enrollees. 

&#160;

ACO 

&#160;

Through our ACO, we provide the following services for our physicians and patients:

&#160;

&#183; Population health management, a population health management and analytics platform to analyze monthly claims data from CMS and data collected from each physician&#8217;s practice

&#160;

&#183; Care coordination in the inpatient and outpatient settings using case managers &#160;

&#183; High-risk management of patients with multiple chronic conditions &#160;

&#183; Educating our physicians. For example, we have a partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim to educate our physicians on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) &#160;

&#183; Services for our patients. For example, we have a partnership with Rite Aid to provide health education, medication reconciliation and motivational interviewing for our patients &#160;

&#183; Promote use of evidence-based medicine by our physicians &#160;

As of March 31, 2016, ApolloMed ACO had over 500 physicians and nearly 12,000 Medicare FFS beneficiaries in California.

&#160;

ApolloMed ACO entered into an agreement with Prospect Medical Group (&#8220;PMG&#8221;), located in Orange, California, that, among other things, granted to PMG a right of first refusal to acquire Apollo Med ACO&#8217;s network of physicians who were contracted with PMG and introduced to ApolloMed ACO by PMG. This right took effect only if ApolloMed ACO elected to sell its operations and terminated on the termination of the agreement between ApolloMed ACO and PMG. The agreement expired in accordance with its terms on December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Care Clinics 

&#160;

Our outpatient clinics provide specialty services, such as cardiology and pulmonary services. ApolloMed also owns an imaging center complete with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compound tomography (CT), cardiac echo, ultrasound, and nuclear and exercise stress-test equipment. Our clinics focus on the efficient delivery of ambulatory treatment and ancillary services, with an increasing emphasis on preventive care and managing chronic conditions. Our clinics also serve as post-discharge centers for patients who have just left the hospital.

&#160;

Our clinics are located within our historical core service areas in the greater Los Angeles area. The clinics have served their communities for many years, handle approximately 20,000 patient visits per year and provide specialty services and lab and imaging services.

Palliative Care, Home Health and Hospice Service Operations 

&#160;

Our palliative care, home health and hospice operations provide hospice, palliative care and home health services for patients using an interdisciplinary team composed of physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers. For hospice services, depending on the needs of the specific patient in each case, our service team may include a physician, nurse, home health aide, medical social worker, chaplain, dietary counselor and bereavement coordinator. Our hospice and palliative care services are provided in the patient's home, assisted living or nursing home or in a hospital. Our home health services are provided directly in each patient&#8217;s home and may include skilled nursing and therapy services, as well as specialty programs such as disease management education, nutrition and help with daily living activities.

&#160;

In October 2013, California enacted the Home Care Services Consumer Protection Act. That act established a licensing program for home care organizations, and requires background checks, basic training and tuberculosis screening for the aides that are employed by home care organizations. Home care organizations and aides had until January 1, 2015 to comply with the new licensing and background check requirements and we are in compliance with the new requirements.

&#160;

Our hospice and home health services are currently offered only in Southern California, with an average daily census of about 64 hospice patients and 120 home health patients during fiscal 2016.

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, entities owned by our subsidiary, ApolloMed Palliative, served over 180 patients on a daily basis.

&#160;

STRENGTHS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 

&#160;

The following are some of the material opportunities that we believe exist for our company.

&#160;

Diversification 

&#160;

Through our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliates, we have been able to reduce our business risk and increase revenue opportunities by diversifying our service offerings and expanding our ability to manage patient care across a horizontally integrated care network. Our revenue is spread across our operations. Additionally, with our ability to monitor and manage care within our wide network, we are a more attractive business partner to health plans, IPAs and health systems seeking to provide better access to care at lower costs.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Strong Management Team 

&#160;

Our management team and Board of Directors have decades of experience managing physician practices, risk-based organizations, health plans, hospitals and health systems. Collectively, they have a deep understanding of the healthcare marketplace, emerging trends and an exciting vision for the future of healthcare delivery that is driven by physician-driven healthcare networks.

&#160;

&#160; Strong Relationships with Physicians 

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, our physician network consisted of over 1,000 contracted physicians, including hospitalists, primary care physicians and specialist physicians, through our owned and affiliated physician groups and ACO.

&#160;

Long-Standing Relationships with Clients Generating Recurring Contractual Revenue 

&#160;

We have long-standing relationships with multiple health plans, hospitals, hospital systems and IPAs which generate recurring contractual revenue.

&#160; 

Comprehensive and Effective Medical Management and Population Health Management Programs 

&#160;

We have developed comprehensive and effective programs for patients with multiple chronic conditions as well as hospitalized patients. Using our own proprietary risk assessment scoring tool, we have also developed our own protocol for identifying high-risk patients. In addition, we have developed expertise in population health management and care coordination, further expanded as a result of our recent acquisition of Apollo Care Connect. Additionally, we have developed expertise in proper medical coding which results in improved Risk Adjustment Factor (&#8220;RAF&#8221;) scores and higher payments from health plans, both for our own IPA patients and other client IPAs. We have also developed expertise in improving quality metrics, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. Our hospitalists have been able to improve hospital core measure quality metrics, and in the outpatient setting, we improved the CMS Quality Score in our ACO and also improved the STAR rating of our IPA. CMS implemented a five-star quality rating for participants in the Medicare Advantage program in 2008.

&#160; 

OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 

&#160;

Our mission is to transform the delivery of health services to the communities we serve by implementing innovative population health and care coordination models and by creating a patient-centered, physician-centric experience in a high-performing environment of integrated care.

&#160;

Our current intention is to implement our strategy through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, as well as dispositions when appropriate. While we have taken many concrete steps to achieve our strategy, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these endeavors and we may not achieve our strategic goals. The principal elements of our growth strategy are:

&#160;

Pursue growth opportunities in established markets . We identify growth opportunities in established markets we serve by working with our local network physicians. Opportunities may include continued physician enrolment for MMG and ApolloMed ACO, additional or expanded hospitalist contracts, new risk-based insurance contracts and new clinic acquisitions.

&#160;

Continue to strengthen our market presence and reputation. We position ourselves to thrive in a changing healthcare environment by continuing to build and operate high-performing, patient-centered care networks, fully engaging in health and wellness, and enhancing our reputation in our markets. We focus particularly on patient safety, patient satisfaction, care coordination, population health and implementing clinical quality best practices across all our operations. We measure the health status of our patients with the goal of directly improving their health.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Focus on high-quality, patient-centered care . We provide high-quality, patient-centered care in our communities. We have implemented several initiatives to maintain and enhance the delivery of high-quality care, including clinical best practices, information technology and tools, coordination of care, home visits, annual wellness exams and population health.

&#160;

Drive physician collaboration and alignment . We foster a collaborative approach among our physicians to provide what we believe to be clinically superior healthcare services. We provide medical management, population health management and care coordination resources to our physicians sufficient to support the necessary, high-quality services to our patients. We have implemented several initiatives, including active participation of physician leadership in ApolloMed ACO, MMG and hospitalist boards and subcommittees, training programs and information technology resources. In addition, we are aligning with our physicians in various forms of risk contracting, including pay-for-performance programs such as clinical documentation improvement to improve RAF scores and certain programs, such as annual wellness visits, to improve Medicare Advantage STAR ratings.

&#160;

Expand ambulatory services and further our population health strategies . We are flexible and competitive in a dynamic healthcare environment. We will continue to add medical management and population health management resources to our ambulatory care services. We intend to pursue further strategies in physician practice management and population health services, such as predictive analytics and telemedicine services. We also intend to pursue the expansion of certain strategic services, such as home health care, hospice and palliative care services in an attempt to create a more comprehensive network of healthcare services.

&#160;

Pursue selective acquisitions . We believe that our philosophy, built on patient-centered healthcare and clinical quality and efficiency, gives us a competitive advantage in expanding our services in our existing markets as well as other markets through acquisitions or partnerships. We regularly monitor opportunities to acquire hospitalist groups, IPAs, ACOs and clinics that fit our vision and long-term strategies.

&#160;

Pursue selective dispositions . We regularly monitor the performance of our operations and have curtailed, cut back on or disposed of, certain operations that either are not performing to our expectations or are creating a financial strain on us.

&#160;

Expand our relationships with payors and facilities in selective markets across the U.S. We intend to explore ways to develop relationships with existing and new health plans and hospitals in selective markets across the U.S. in order to participate in the growing hospitalist medicine market, under value-based contracts.

&#160;

Acquisitions and Dispositions 

&#160; 

In furtherance of our growth strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to add to our portfolio of healthcare companies in areas where we do not have a presence, in order to expand our geographic footprint, in areas where we already have a presence to increase our market share, and in areas of practice that are complementary to our existing business model. Similarly, we periodically evaluate parts of our business that may not fit within our overall business model or may be underperforming and, when appropriate, we may dispose of such companies.

&#160;

In January 2016, we formed Apollo Care Connect, Inc. (&#8220;Apollo Care Connect&#8221;) which acquired certain technology and other assets of Healarium, Inc., which provides us with a population health management platform that includes digital care plans, a case management module, connectivity with multiple healthcare tracking devices and the ability to integrate with multiple electronic health records to capture clinical data. We issued 275,000 shares of our Common Stock in exchange for the acquired assets and the seller paid us $200,000.

&#160;

Also during fiscal 2016, we sold substantially all the assets of ApolloMed Care Clinic (&#8220;ACC&#8221;). ACC was as clinic providing care in Los Angeles area. The purchase price was $61,000 of which we received $10,000 in cash and the balance in the form of a non-interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of $51,000. We also combined the operations of one of our IPAs, AKM, into those of our other IPA, MMG.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Hospitalists 

&#160;

We believe that attractive growth opportunities exist for our hospitalists&#8217; inpatient business due to the increasing need for improved efficiencies in the hospital from both payors and hospital management teams. Our physicians work closely with our partners to improve the care given to patients and their families and enhance how care is coordinated within the hospital and upon discharge of the patient. We have designed programs for some of the largest health plans and hospital chains in California to improve outcomes, reduce over-utilization, reduce Medicaid denial rates, optimize lengths of stay, optimize senior and commercial bed-days, improve Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores, improve hospital core measures, improve documentation and reduce 30-day readmissions. In addition, our physicians consult with hospital management teams to assist in Medicaid denial reviews, case management and improving discharge management.

&#160;

We believe that the demand for hospitalists, including our hospitalists&#8217; inpatient business, will continue to grow due to the following significant changes in the healthcare delivery system:

&#160;

The primary care physician&#8217;s role in hospital care appears to be decreasing due to the increasingly specialized nature of hospital care, the demands of treating increasingly sicker patients in the hospital and higher acuity patients in the clinic, the increased time it takes to round on patients in the hospital due to electronic health records and the desire to reduce on-call obligations.

&#160;

Hospitals have a greater need for consistent on-site physician availability due to the increasing severity of illness required to justify hospital admissions, the need to reduce readmissions, the need for better documentation and external pressures to decrease the inpatient length of stay.

&#160;

Health plans, IPAs and other payors are searching for strategies to control the increase in inpatient expenditures.

&#160;

There is increasing pressure in providing a coordinated continuum of care for patients to improve the quality of care, improve patient satisfaction and to reduce costs over an entire episode of care.

&#160; 

IPAs 

&#160; 

Senior/Medicare Advantage Market Opportunity. We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for patient-centered, physician-centric integrated groups serving the growing senior market. At present, approximately 55 million Americans are eligible for Medicare according to CMS. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 2 million Americans turn age 65 in the United States each year, and this number is expected to grow as the so-called baby boomers continue to turn 65. Also, many large employers that traditionally provided medical and prescription drug coverage to their retirees have begun to curtail these benefits. In addition, the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;), increased the healthcare options available to Medicare beneficiaries through the expansion of Medicare managed care plans through the Medicare Advantage program.

&#160; 

Medicaid Program and Dual Eligibles . As a result of the Health Reform Acts, CMS projects that the total number of uninsured Americans will fall to 23 million by 2023 from 45 million in 2012. This represents a significant new market opportunity for health plans and integrated healthcare delivery companies such as ApolloMed, and we believe that we are strategically positioned to benefit from this expansion.

&#160;

&#8220;Dual-eligibles&#8221; present another opportunity for us. According to CMS data for 2013, the most recently available year, there are approximately 9 million dual-eligible enrollees. We believe that this represents a significant opportunity for companies like ours that have the capabilities to effectively manage this population.

&#160; 

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

ACOs 

&#160;

We believe that there are growth opportunities in the ACO market, both through starting new ACOs in new geographic areas, as well as by acquisition of, or joint ventures with, existing ACOs. Additionally, CMS is changing the business model of ACOs to allow ACOs to assume more financial risk. We submitted an application to CMS on May 25, 2016 for the Next Generation ACO under the AIPBP model. We also believe that there are increasing opportunities for ACOs to contract with health plans for commercial patients.

&#160; 

Palliative Care, Home Health and Hospice 

&#160;

We believe that there are multiple factors that will contribute to the growth of the hospice and home health industry, including (i) increasing consumer and physician awareness and interest in hospice, palliative and home health services; (ii) recognizing that in-home services can be a cost-effective alternative to more expensive institutional care; (iii) aging demographics and hanging family structures in which more aging people will be living alone and may be in need of assistance; (iv) the psychological benefits of recuperating from an illness or accident or receiving care for a chronic condition in one&#8217;s own home; and (v) medical and technological advances that allow more healthcare procedures and monitoring to be provided at home.

&#160;

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE 

&#160;

Our business and operations are located exclusively in California, and all of our revenue is derived from our operations in California. As of March 31, 2016, through our managed physician practices, we provided hospitalist services at more than 20 acute-care hospitals and long-term acute care facilities in Southern and Central California, and operated 3 primary care and specialty medical clinics in the Los Angeles area. MMG provides primary and specialist care through its contracted physicians throughout the greater Los Angeles area. ApolloMed ACO has nearly 12000 Medicare beneficiaries assigned to it by CMS in California.

&#160;

CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 

&#160;

Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries and certain affiliated medical practices. Some states have laws that prohibit business entities with non-physician owners, such as ApolloMed, from practicing medicine, which are generally referred to as corporate practice of medicine. States that have corporate practice of medicine laws require only physicians to practice medicine, exercise control over medical decisions or engage in certain arrangements with other physicians, such as fee-splitting. California is a corporate practice of medicine state. Therefore, in California, we operate by maintaining long-term management service agreements with our affiliates, each of which are owned and operated by physicians, and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide hospitalist services. Under management agreements, we provide and perform all non-medical management and administrative services, including financial management, information systems, marketing, risk management and administrative support. The management agreements typically have an initial term of 20 years unless terminated by either party for cause. The management agreements are not terminable by our affiliates, except in the case of gross negligence, fraud, or other illegal acts by ApolloMed, or the bankruptcy of ApolloMed.

&#160;

When necessary, Dr. Hosseinion, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as nominee shareholder, on our behalf, of affiliated medical practices, in order to comply with healthcare laws and certain accounting rules applicable to consolidated financial reporting.

&#160;

Through the management agreements and our relationship with the physician owners of our medical affiliates, we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decisions related to the ongoing business operations of those affiliates. Consequently, we consolidate the revenue and expenses of our affiliates from the date of execution of the management agreements, as the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;).

&#160;

OUR REVENUE STREAMS 

&#160;

We generate revenue through various contractual agreements which vary in both structure and by type of business operation. These contracts are multi-year renewable contracts that include traditional &#8220;fee for service&#8221;, capitation, case rates, and professional and institutional risk contracts. Our revenue streams consist of contracted, fee-for-service, capitation, and MSSP revenue.

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Contracted revenue 

&#160;

Contracted revenue represents revenue generated under management agreements for which ApolloMed provides physician and other healthcare staffing and administrative services in return for a contractually negotiated fee. Contracted revenue consists primarily of billings based on hours of healthcare staffing provided at agreed-upon hourly rates. Additionally, contracted revenue also includes supplemental revenue from hospitals where we may have an FFS contract arrangement or provide physician advisory services to the medical staff at a specific facility. Such contract terms generally either provides for a fixed monthly dollar amount or a variable amount based upon measurable monthly activity, such as hours staffed, patient visits or collections per visit, compared to a minimum activity threshold. Such supplemental revenues based on variable arrangements are usually contractually fixed on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis considering the variable factors negotiated in each such agreement. Additionally, we derive a portion of our revenue as a contractual bonus from collections received by our partners and such revenue is contingent upon the collection of third-party billings.

&#160;

FFS revenue 

&#160;

FFS revenue represents revenue earned under agreements in which ApolloMed bills and collects the professional component of charges for medical services rendered by our contracted and employed physicians. Under our FFS arrangements, we bill patients for services provided and receive payment from patients or their third-party payors. FFS revenue is reported net of contractual allowances and policy discounts. All services provided are expected to result in cash flows and are therefore reflected as net revenue in our consolidated financial statements. The recognition of net revenue (gross charges less contractual allowances) from patient visits is dependent on such factors as proper completion of medical charts following a patient visit, the forwarding of such charts to our billing center for medical coding and entering into our billing system and the verification of each patient&#8217;s submission or representation at the time services are rendered as to the payor(s) responsible for payment for such services.

&#160;

Capitation revenue 

&#160;

Capitation revenue represents revenue that ApolloMed generates based on agreements that generally make ApolloMed or our affiliates liable for excess medical costs. The use of capitation under provider service agreements (&#8220;PSAs&#8221;) is intended to control the use of health care resources by putting ApolloMed or our affiliates at financial risk for services provided to patients. Capitation is a fixed amount of money per patient per unit of time paid in advance for the delivery of health care services. The actual amount of money paid to us is determined by the ranges of services that we provide, the number of patients involved, and the period of time during which the services are provided. Capitation rates under our PSAs are generally based on local costs and average utilization of services. To ensure that contracting physicians provide necessary care to their patients, we monitor and measure rates of resource utilization in physician practices and submit reports to appropriate regulators. These reports are made available to the public as a measure of health care quality, and can be linked to financial rewards, such as bonuses. For example, we receive incentives under &#8220;pay-for-performance&#8221; programs for quality medical care, based on various criteria.

&#160;

Additionally, Medicare pays capitation using a &#8220;risk adjustment&#8221; model, which compensates managed care organizations and providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual enrollee. Health plans and providers with higher acuity enrollees receive more and those with lower acuity enrollees receive less. Under risk adjustment, capitation is determined based on health severity, measured using patient encounter data. Capitation is paid on an interim basis based on data submitted for the enrollee for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled.

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

MSSP Revenue 

&#160;

Through our subsidiary, ApolloMed ACO, we participate in the MSSP sponsored by CMS. The MSSP allows ACO participants to share in cost savings it generates in connection with rendering medical services to Medicare patients. Payments to ACO participants, if any, are calculated annually and paid once a year by CMS on cost savings generated by the ACO participant relative to the ACO participants&#8217; CMS benchmark. Under the MSSP program, an ACO either receives the full amount of its allocable cost savings or nothing. The MSSP is a newly formed program with minimal history of payments to ACO participants. Under the final MSSP rules, Medicare will continue to pay individual providers and suppliers for specific items and services as it currently does under the FFS payment methodologies. The MSSP rules require CMS to develop a benchmark for savings to be achieved by each ACO if the ACO is to receive shared savings. An ACO that meets the MSSP&#8217;s quality performance standards will be eligible to receive a share of the savings to the extent its assigned beneficiary medical expenditures are below the medical expenditure benchmark provided by CMS. An MSR must be achieved before the ACO can receive a share of the savings. Once the MSR is surpassed, all the savings below the benchmark provided by CMS will be shared 50% with the ACO. The MSR varies depending on the number of patients assigned to the ACO, starting at 3.9% for ACOs with patients totaling 5,000 and increasing to 2% for ACOs with more than 60,000 patients.

&#160;

We consider revenue, if any, under the MSSP, as contingent upon the realization of program savings as determined by CMS, and are not considered earned and therefore are not recognized as revenue until notice from CMS that cash payments are to be imminently received. We received an MSSP payment in fiscal 2015 but we did not receive an MSSP payment in fiscal 2016.

&#160;

Types of Revenue by Business Operation 

&#160;

Each of our operations generates revenue in the following manners:

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Hospitalists. AMH contracts with health plans or IPAs to be paid on fee schedules or case rates to see patients and earns revenue primarily on a contracted basis. AMH also contracts directly with hospitals for fixed monthly stipends for continuous staffing coverage. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; IPA. MMG earns revenue based on capitation payments from health plans. In California, health plans prospectively pay the IPA or medical group a fixed PMPM amount, or capitation payment, which is often based on a percentage of the amount received by the health plan. Capitation payments to medical groups or IPAs, in the aggregate, represent a prospective budget from which the IPA manages care-related expenses on behalf of the population enrolled with that IPA. Those IPAs or medical groups that manage care-related expenses under the capitated levels will realize an operating profit; if care-related expenses exceed projected levels, the IPA will realize an operating deficit. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; ACO. ApolloMed ACO is a &#8220;shared savings&#8221; performance model that has contracted with CMS and earns revenue from MSSP based on cost-savings achieved. As discussed above, the MSSP reward ACOs that lower their healthcare costs while meeting performance standards on quality of care and patient satisfaction on an all-or-nothing basis once a year. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Care Clinics &#160;- ApolloMed Care Clinic&#8217;s clinics receives the majority of their revenue from traditional FFS models where the physicians are paid based on professional fee schedules from various health plans, and also receive capitated payments from IPAs, including MMG. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Palliative Care, Home Health and Hospice Service Operations - ApolloMed Palliative, which includes BCHC and Holistic Health, receives both FFS and contracted revenue. Under the home health Prospective Payment System (&#8220;PPS&#8221;) of reimbursement, for Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs paid at episodic rates, ApolloMed estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data, relating to each patient&#8217;s health status including clinical condition, functional abilities and service needs, as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels of employees providing services to the patient. Billings under PPS are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period. The process for recognizing revenue to be recorded is based on certain assumptions and judgments, including (i) the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard 60 day episode; (ii) any differences between the clinical assessment of and the therapy service needs for each patient at the time of certification as compared to actual experience; and (iii) the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits, are discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same 60-day episodic period or are subject to certain other factors during the episode. Revenues for hospice are recorded on an accrual basis based on the number of days a patient has been on service at amounts equal to an estimated payment rate. The payment rate is dependent on whether a patient is receiving routine home care, general inpatient care, continuous home care or respite care. Adjustments to Medicare revenues are recorded based on an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor or other reasons unrelated to credit risk. 

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Key Payors 

&#160;

We have a few key payors that represent a significant portion of our net revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, three payors accounted for 55.4% of our net revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, three payors accounted for 60.3% of our net revenue.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Year Ended March 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; Year Ended March 31, 2016 &#160; Medicare/Medi-Cal &#160; &#160; 34.8 % &#160; &#160; 29.8 % L.A Care &#160; &#160; 13.2 % &#160; &#160; 15.7 % Health Net &#160; &#160; 12.3 % &#160; &#160; 9.9 % 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented across all of our services and operations. We compete for customers with many other healthcare providers, including local physicians and practice groups as well as local, regional and national networks of physicians, hospitals and other healthcare companies, many of which are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial and other resources, including personnel than we have.

&#160; 

Hospitalists 

&#160;

AMH faces competition primarily from numerous small inpatient practices as well as large physician groups. Some of our competitors operate on a national level, such as EmCare, Team Health and Sound Physicians, and many of them have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. In addition, because the market for hospitalist services is highly fragmented and the ability of individual physicians to provide services in any hospital where they have certain credentials and privileges, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to our largest competitors.

&#160;

IPAs 

&#160;

Our affiliated IPA, MMG, competes with other IPAs, medical groups and hospitals. Many of our competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. For example, in Los Angeles, examples of our competitors include Regal Medical Group and Lakeside Medical group, which are part of the Heritage Provider Network (&#8220;Heritage&#8221;), as well as HealthCare Partners, which is owned by DaVita HealthCare Partners (&#8220;DaVita&#8221;).

&#160; 

ACOs 

&#160;

ApolloMed ACO competes with hospitals, sophisticated provider groups, and MSOs in the creation, administration, and management of ACOs. Many of our competitors have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. For example, in Los Angeles, our competitors include Heritage California ACO, which is part of Heritage and operates a Pioneer ACO, and HealthCare Partners ACO, which is owned by DaVita and which participates in the MSSP.

&#160; 

Palliative Care, Home Health and Hospice 

&#160;

The Palliative care and hospice providers with which we compete include not-for-profit and charity-funded programs that may have strong ties to their local communities and for-profit programs that may have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. Home health providers include not-for-profit and for-profit facility-based agencies, such as hospitals or nursing homes, as well as independent companies, some of which are large publicly-traded companies and which have greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Apollo Palliative Services competes with Hospice and Home Health agencies with greater financial, personnel and other resources available to them. For example, in Los Angeles, our competitors include Vitas, Kindred, Haven and Lakeview

&#160;

PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY AND OTHER INSURANCE COVERAGE 

&#160;

Our business has an inherent and significant risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. Our independent physician contractors and we pay premiums for third-party professional liability insurance that indemnifies our affiliated hospitalists and us on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation. Professional liability coverage is required in order for our affiliated hospitalists to maintain hospital privileges. All of our physicians carry first dollar coverage with limits of liability equal to $1,000,000 for all claims based on occurrence up to an aggregate of $3,000,000 per year.

&#160;

While we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us, our affiliated professional organizations or our affiliated hospitalists in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable. We believe that the ultimate resolution of all pending claims, including liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that future claims will not have such a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

We also maintain worker&#8217;s compensation, director and officer, and other third-party insurance coverage subject to deductibles and other restrictions that we believe are in accordance with industry standards. We believe that these insurance coverage limits are appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, we cannot assure that any pending or future claim will not be successful or if successful will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.

&#160; 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

&#160; 

Significant Federal and State Healthcare Laws Governing Our Business 

&#160;

As a healthcare company, our operations and relationships with healthcare providers such as hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government entities. These laws and regulations often are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, CMS, and various state authorities. We have included brief descriptions of some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that affect our business below.

&#160;

Imposition of liabilities associated with a violation of any of these healthcare laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot guarantee that its arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate certain healthcare laws. Government investigations and prosecutions, even if we are ultimately found to be without fault, can be costly and disruptive to our business. Moreover, changes in healthcare legislation or government regulation may restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160; 

False Claims Acts 

&#160;

The federal False Claims Act imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim for payment approved. Private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the government and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit.

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. By way of illustration, these prosecutions may be based upon alleged coding errors, billing for services not rendered, billing services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. The government and a number of courts also have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the False Claims Act based on the theory that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement.

&#160;

Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties as well as exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.

&#160;

A number of states have enacted false claims acts that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Even more states are expected to do so in the future because Section 6031 of the DRA, amended the federal law to encourage these types of changes, along with a corresponding increase in state initiated false claims enforcement efforts. Under the DRA, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state&#8217;s false claims act. The OIG, in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States, is responsible for determining if a state&#8217;s false claims act complies with the statutory requirements. Currently, many states, including California have some form of state false claims act.

&#160;

Anti-Kickback Statutes 

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The ACA amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the ACA, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

&#160;

Due to the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute&#8217;s broad prohibitions, statutory exceptions exist that protect certain arrangements from prosecution. In addition, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that specify arrangements that also are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of an activity to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but these arrangements may be subject to scrutiny and prosecution by enforcement agencies. The conduct or business arrangement, however, does increase the risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. We may be less willing than some of our competitors to take actions or enter into business arrangements that do not clearly satisfy the safe harbors. As a result, this unwillingness may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. For example, California has adopted the Physician Outpatient Referral Act (&#8220;PORA&#8221;). PORA makes it unlawful for a healing arts licensee, including physicians and surgeons, and other licensed professionals, to refer a person for certain health care services if the licensee has a financial interest, with the person or entity that receives the referral. While the law also provides certain exemptions from this prohibition, failure to fit within an exemption in violation of PORA can lead to a misdemeanor offense that may subject a physician to civil penalties and disciplinary action by the Medical Board of California.

&#160;

Although we have established policies and procedures to ensure that our arrangements with physicians comply with current laws and applicable regulations, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities that enforce these laws will not determine that some of these arrangements violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160; 

Federal Stark Law 

&#160;

The Federal Stark Law, also known as the physician self-referral law, generally prohibits a physician from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing &#8216;&#8216;designated health services,&#8217;&#8217; if the physician or a member of the physician&#8217;s immediate family has a &#8216;&#8216;financial relationship&#8217;&#8217; with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services, and other items or services that our affiliated physicians may order. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and business arrangements from penalty. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.

&#160;

The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services and civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, double damages, and possible exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law&#8217;s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme.

&#160;

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state.

&#160;

Because the Stark Law and its implementing regulations continue to evolve, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of this law and its regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot be certain that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. In addition, in the July 2008 final Stark rule, CMS indicated that it will continue to enact further regulations tightening aspects of the Stark Law that it perceives allow for Medicare program abuse, especially those regulations that still permit physicians to profit from their referrals of ancillary services. There can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with physicians and facilities will be found to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be implemented or interpreted.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Health Information Privacy and Security Standards 

&#160;

Among other directives, the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), required the Department of Health and Human Services, or the HHS, to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of certain health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by &#8220;HIPAA covered entities,&#8221; which include entities like the Company, our affiliated hospitalists, and practice groups.

&#160;

In addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.

&#160;

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enacted on February 18, 2009, included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) which modified the HIPAA legislation significantly. Pursuant to HITECH, certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations become directly applicable to &#8220;HIPAA business associates&#8221;.

&#160;

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security standards may result in civil and criminal penalties. Historically, these included: (1) civil money penalties of $100 per incident, to a maximum of $25,000, per person, per year, per standard violated and (2) depending upon the nature of the violation, fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to ten years. The passage of HITECH significantly modified the enforcement structure, creating a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. We must also comply with the &#8220;breach notification&#8221; regulations, which implement certain provisions of HITECH. Under these regulations, in addition to reasonable remediation, covered entities must promptly notify affected individuals in the case of a breach of &#8220;unsecured PHI,&#8221; which is defined by HHS guidance, as well as the HHS Secretary and the media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to the HHS Secretary on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches at or by the business associate. Formal enforcement of the new breach notification regulations began on February 22, 2010.

&#160;

We expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. Under HITECH, state Attorneys General now have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator. This methodology for compensation to harmed individuals was initially required to be in place by February 17, 2012; however, no rules or regulations implementing this methodology have yet been adopted by HHS. HHS may nonetheless eventually establish such methodology for compensation to harmed individuals.

&#160;

Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused.

&#160; 

Fee-Splitting and Corporate Practice of Medicine 

&#160;

Some states, including California, have laws that prohibit business entities, such as us and our subsidiaries, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. In these states, a violation of the corporate practice of medicine prohibition constitutes the unlawful practice of medicine, which is a public offense punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. In addition, any physician who participates in a scheme that violates the state&#8217;s corporate practice of medicine prohibition may be punished for aiding and abetting a lay entity in the unlawful practice of medicine. The Company operates by maintaining long-term management contracts with affiliated professional organizations, which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide hospitalist services. Under these arrangements, we perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that we offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the affiliated professional organizations. The California Medical Board, as well as other state&#8217;s regulatory bodies, has taken the position that certain physician practice management agreements that confer too much control over a physician practice violate the prohibition against corporate practice of medicine.

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We operate by maintaining long-term management contracts with affiliated professional organizations, which are each owned and operated by physicians and other individuals, and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide clinical services. Under these arrangements, we perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that we offer medical services, and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the affiliated professional organizations.

&#160;

For financial reporting purposes, however, we consolidate the revenues and expenses of all our practice groups that we own or manage because we have a controlling financial interest in these practices based on applicable accounting rules and as described in our consolidated financial statements. In states where fee-splitting is prohibited between physicians and non-physicians, the fees that we receive through our management contracts have been established on a basis that we believe complies with the applicable state laws.

&#160;

Some of the relevant laws, regulations, and agency interpretations in the State of California and other states that have corporate practice prohibitions have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. Moreover, state laws are subject to change and regulatory authorities and other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that our arrangements constitute unlawful fee-splitting. If this occurred, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable (in whole or in part), or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements. If we were required to restructure our operating structures due to determination that a corporate practice of medicine violation existed, such a restructuring might include revisions of our management services agreements, which might include a modification of the management fee, and/ or establishing an alternative structure.

&#160; 

Deficit Reduction Act Of 2005 

&#160;

Among other mandates, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the &#8220;DRA&#8221;) created a new Medicaid Integrity Program designed to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse. Additionally, section 6032 of the DRA requires entities that make or receive annual Medicaid payments of $5.0 million or more from any one state to provide their employees, contractors and agents with written policies and employee handbook materials on federal and state False Claims Acts and related statues. At this time, we are not required to comply with section 6032 because we receive less than $5.0 million in Medicaid payments annually from any one state. However, we may likely be required to comply in the future as our Medicaid billings increase.

&#160;

Other Federal Healthcare Compliance Laws 

&#160;

We are also subject to other federal healthcare laws.

&#160;

In 1995, Congress amended the federal criminal statutes set forth in Title 18 of the United States Code by defining additional federal crimes that could have an impact on our business, including &#8220;Health Care Fraud&#8221; and &#8220;False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters.&#8221; The Health Care Fraud provision prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. As defined in this provision of Title 18, a &#8220;healthcare benefit program&#8221; can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. The ACA amended section 1347 of Title 18 to provide that a person may be convicted under the Health Care Fraud provision even in the absence of proof that the person had actual knowledge of, or specific intent to violate, the statute.

&#160;

The False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters provision prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both.

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under the Civil Monetary Penalties law of the Social Security Act, a person, including any individual or organization, may be subject to civil monetary penalties, treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs for certain specified conduct. One provision of the Civil Monetary Penalties law precludes any person (including an organization) from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services that the person knows or should know (a) were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program or (e) are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as specifically permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act.

&#160;

Other State Healthcare Compliance Provisions 

&#160;

In addition to the state laws previously described, we may also be subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations if we expand our operations beyond California. Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Generally, state laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.

&#160;

Knox-Keene Act and Other State Insurance Laws 

&#160;

Some of the medical groups and IPAs that have entered into management services agreements with us, have historically contracted with health plans and other payors to receive a per member per month (&#8220;PMPM&#8221;) or percentage of premium capitation payment for professional (physician) services and assumed the financial responsibility for professional services. In many of these cases, the health plans or other payors separately enter into contracts with hospitals that directly receive payment (either a capitation or fee-for-service payment) and assume some type of contractual financial responsibility for their institutional (hospital) services. In some instances, the Company&#8217;s managed medical groups and IPAs have been paid by their contracting payor for the financial outcome of managing the care dollars associated with both the professional and institutional services received by the medical groups&#8217; and IPAs&#8217; members. In the case of institutional services, the medical groups and IPAs have recognized a percentage of the surplus of institutional revenues less institutional expense as the medical groups&#8217; and IPAs&#8217; net revenues and has also been responsible for some percentage of any short-fall in the event that institutional expenses exceed institutional revenues. Notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its managed medical groups or IPAs are contractually obligated to pay claims to any hospitals or other institutions under these arrangements. The Department of Managed Health Care (&#8220;DMHC&#8221;) of California licenses and regulates health care service plans pursuant to the Knox-Keene Act. We do not hold a limited Knox-Keene license. If DMHC were to determine that we have been inappropriately taking risk for institutional and professional services as a result of our various hospital and physician arrangements without having a limited Knox-Keene license, we may be required to obtain a limited Knox-Keene license to resolve such violations and we could be subject to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

Furthermore, some states require ACOs to be registered or otherwise comply with state insurance laws. Our affiliated ACO does not currently take financial risk, and is therefore not registered with any state insurance agency. If a state insurance agency were to determine that we have been inappropriately operating an ACO without state registration or licensure, we may be required to obtain such registration or licensure to resolve such violations and we could be subject to liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Licensing, Certification, Accreditation and Related Laws and Guidelines 

&#160;

Our clinical personnel are subject to numerous federal, state and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Since the Company performs services at hospitals and other types of healthcare facilities, it may indirectly be subject to laws applicable to those entities as well as ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional trade associations and private accreditation commissions, such as the American Medical Association and The Joint Commission. There are penalties for non-compliance with these laws and standards, including loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, loss of hospital admitting privileges, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our affiliated physician organizations to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable health care laws and regulations, including any new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations.

&#160; 

Professional Licensing Requirements 

&#160;

Our affiliated hospitalists must satisfy and maintain their individual professional licensing in each state where they practice medicine. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject them to sanctions, or to even lose their license and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well. Some state boards of medicine impose reciprocal discipline, that is, if a physician is disciplined for having committed professional misconduct in one state where he or she is licensed, another state where he or she is also licensed may impose the same discipline even though the conduct occurred in another state. Professional licensing sanctions may also result in exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third-party programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our affiliated physician organizations to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable health care laws and regulations, including any new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations.

&#160;

Home Health and Hospice Regulation 

&#160;

We have invested in business lines consisting of home health, hospice and palliative care, which require compliance with additional regulatory requirements. For example, we must comply with laws relating to hospice care eligibility, the development and maintenance of plans of care, and the coordination of services with nursing homes or assisted living facilities where many of our patients live. In addition, our hospice programs are licensed as required under state law as either hospices or home health agencies.

&#160;

The following is a discussion of the regulations that we believe most significantly affect our home health and hospice business.

&#160; 

Licensure, Certification, Accreditation and Related Laws and Guidelines 

&#160;

Our agencies and facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care, to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. To assure continued compliance with these various regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our agencies and facilities. Additionally, our clinical professionals are subject to numerous federal, state and local licensing laws and regulations, relating to, among other things, professional credentialing and professional ethics. Clinical professionals are also subject to state and federal regulation regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Each state defines the scope of practice of clinical professionals through legislation and through the respective Boards of Medicine and Nursing, and many states require that nurse practitioners and physician assistants work in collaboration with or under the supervision of a physician. There are penalties for noncompliance with these laws and standards, including the loss of professional license, civil or criminal fines and penalties, federal health care program disenrollment, loss of billing privileges, and exclusion from participation in various governmental and other third-party healthcare programs. We operate our business to ensure that our employees and agents possess all necessary licenses and certifications.

&#160;

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Reimbursement for palliative care and house call services is generally conditioned on our clinical professionals providing the correct procedure and diagnosis codes and properly documenting both the service itself and the medical necessity for the service. Incorrect or incomplete documentation and billing information, or the incorrect selection of codes for the level and type of service provided, could result in non-payment for services rendered or lead to allegations of billing fraud.

&#160; 

Medicare Participation 

&#160;

To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments, our agencies and facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by CMS. Among other things, these requirements, known as the &#8220;Conditions of Participation&#8221; relate to the type of facility, its personnel, and its standards of medical care, as well as its compliance with state and local laws and regulations. The Conditions of Participation for hospice programs include, but may not be limited to regulation of the: Governing Body, Medical Director, Direct Provision of Core Services, Professional Management of Non-Core Services, Plan of Care, Continuation of Care, Informed Consent, Training, Quality Assurance, Interdisciplinary Team, Volunteers, Licensure, Central Clinical Records, Surveys and Audits, Billing Audits/ Claims Reviews, Certificate of Need Laws and Other Restrictions, Limitations on For-Profit Ownership, Limits on the Acquisition or Conversion of Non-Profit Health Care Organizations, and Professional Licensure.

&#160;

To be eligible for Medicare payments for home health services, a patient must be &#8220;homebound&#8221; (cannot leave home without considerable or taxing effort), require periodic skilled nursing or physical or speech therapy services, and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician based upon a face-to-face encounter between the patient and the physician.

&#160;

From time to time we receive survey reports containing statements of deficiencies. We review such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. If a hospice or home health agency were found to be out of compliance and actions were taken against that hospice or home health agency, this could materially adversely affect the entity&#8217;s ability to continue to operate, to provide certain services and to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could materially adversely affect our business operations.

&#160;

Billing Audits/Claims Reviews. The Medicare program and its fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims. There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. In order to conduct these reviews, the payor requests documentation from us and then reviews that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of patients to receive hospice benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those patients and the documentation of that care. Our claims have been subject to review and audit. We make appropriate provisions in our accounting records to reduce our revenue for anticipated denial of payment related to these audits and reviews. We believe our hospice programs comply with all payor requirements at the time of billing. However, we cannot predict whether future billing reviews or similar audits by payors will result in material denials or reductions in revenue.

&#160;

Professional Licensure and Participation Agreements. Many hospice employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their profession, including physicians, physical, speech and occupational therapists, social workers, home health aides, pharmacists and nurses. In addition, those professionals who are eligible to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs as individuals must not have been excluded from participation in those programs at any time.

&#160; 

Environmental and Occupational Health 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all we could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management&#8217;s attention to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations.

&#160;

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are implemented, and regulations might adversely affect our operations.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of March 31, 2016, ApolloMed, its subsidiaries and its consolidated affiliates (including affiliated clinics) had 150 employees, of whom 148 were full-time and 2 were part-time, and more than 85 employed or independent contractor physicians. We also had a broader physician network which, as of March 31, 2016, consisted of approximately 1,000 additional contracted physicians who provided services to us. None of our employees is a member of a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that we enjoy a good working relationship with our employees.

&#160;
