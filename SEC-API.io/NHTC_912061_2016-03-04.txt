 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview of Business 

&#160; 

Natural Health Trends Corp. is an international direct-selling and e-commerce company headquartered in Rolling Hills Estates, California. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and &#8220;quality of life&#8221; products under the &#8220;NHT Global&#8221; brand. In most markets, we sell our products to a network of members referred to us by other members. 

&#160; 

Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: North America; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; South Korea; Japan; and Europe, which consists of Italy and Slovenia. We also operate within certain Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia and Kazakhstan) through our engagement with a local service provider. 

&#160; 

Our subsidiaries sell our products into many markets, primarily through our network marketing operations. The exception is our Chinese entity, where we sell directly to consumers through an e-commerce retail platform. Our objectives are to enrich the lives of the users of our products and enable our members to benefit financially from the sale of our products. 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated as a Florida corporation in 1988. We re-incorporated in Delaware effective June 29, 2005. 

&#160; 

Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;NHTC.&#8221;

We continuously source unique, proprietary and immediate impact products to offer to our members and customers. Our product development is an ongoing process that is fueled by marketplace trends, new scientific findings, member input, research and vendor proposals. 

&#160; 

Working closely with raw material manufacturers and contract manufacturers, our mission is to co-develop and bring to market the highest quality products. Our manufacturers are primarily located in the United States, as well as a few in South Korea, Hong Kong and China. Our raw materials are sourced from reputable suppliers around the world. In addition, raw material Certificates of Analysis are reviewed in our effort to assure that the appropriate testing has been performed and are within ingredient specification requirements. 

&#160; 

Operations of the Business 

&#160; 

Operating Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to help our members succeed in achieving their life objectives; be it personal health, beauty, happiness or financial security. Our professionals focus on assisting our members in attaining their goals. 

We believe we have a competitive business model applicable to the markets in which we operate based on six key competencies: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our field leaders are experienced and culturally coherent. They work effectively with our management, implementing our strategies and providing continuous feedback to improve our services. 

&#8226; 

A discipline and capability has been established to continue launching high-quality consumer products that are designed to facilitate the accomplishment of our corporate objectives. 

&#8226; 

We have developed and rolled out a comprehensive training system that provides a complete career path appropriate for our members. Our training material covers the needs of our members, be they prospects, new recruits, product evangelists, sales leaders or dream builders. 

&#8226; 

We have developed a year-round, multi-faceted promotional plan that targets different segments of our membership and has proven most effective in the last few years. 

&#8226; 

We have implemented a commission structure that makes it as easy as possible to join our business, while giving existing members a chance to start making money as quickly as possible in multiple ways. 

&#8226; 

The continuously improving mentality and methodology in our customer services have not only distinguished us as an organization, but have also given us a constant flow of information as to how we can do better to service our members. 

Sourcing of Products 

&#160; 

Our corporate staff works with research and development personnel of our manufacturers and other prospective vendors to create product concepts and develop the product ideas into actual products. We then may enter into supply agreements with the vendors pursuant to which we obtain rights to sell the products under private labels (or trademarks) that are owned by us. In addition, some of our local markets introduce their own products from time to time and these products are sometimes adopted by our other markets. 

&#160; 

We generally purchase finished goods from manufacturers and sell them to our members for personal consumption. We believe that in the event we are unable to source products from our current or alternate suppliers, our revenue, income and cash flow could be adversely and materially impacted. We have a contract with one of our suppliers through February 2019 with automatic renewal rights. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We distribute our products internationally primarily through a network marketing system, which is a form of person-to-person direct selling. Under this system, members primarily refer our products to prospective consumers or they may buy at wholesale prices for resale to consumers and for personal consumption. The concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends, neighbors, relatives, and close acquaintances. We believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person-to-person product education and testimonials as well as higher levels of customer service, all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels. In this document, we generically use the term &#8220;member&#8221; to refer to members who purchase for their own consumption or for resale, or both, as well as to members who only sign up to consume our products. 

&#160; 

Each of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly sales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product&#8217;s wholesale price. 

Our members are independent full-time or part-time contractors who purchase products directly from our subsidiaries via the internet for their own personal consumption or for resale to retail consumers. Purchasers of our products in China and certain other markets may purchase only for their own personal consumption and not for resale. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth the number of active members by market as of the dates indicated. We consider a member &#8220;active&#8221; if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year.

Members must agree to the terms and conditions of our member agreement posted on our website and generally pay an annual enrollment fee. The member agreement sets forth our policies and procedures, and we may elect to terminate a member for non-compliance. 

&#160; 

We pay commissions to eligible members based on product purchases by such members&#8217; down-line members during a given commission period. To be eligible to receive commissions, members in some countries may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of products. See &#8220;Working with Members . &#8221; 

&#160; 

Members generally place orders through the internet and pay by credit card prior to shipment. Accordingly, we carry minimal accounts receivable and credit losses are historically negligible. 

&#160; 

We sponsor promotional meetings and motivational training events for current and potential members. These events are designed to inform prospective and existing members about both existing and new product lines, our latest marketing and promotional plans, and new services improvements. These events also serve as a venue for recognition of member accomplishments. Members typically share their experiences in using our products and developing their business at these events. We are continually developing or updating our marketing strategies and programs to motivate our members. 

&#160; 

Management Information Systems 

&#160; 

Our business uses a proprietary web-based system to process orders and to communicate bonus volume activity and commissions to members. We have automated a substantial amount of our financial reporting processes through implementation of Oracle&#8217;s E-Business Suite, and we intend to integrate other critical business processes such as inventory management. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 133 total full-time employees worldwide, of which 25 were located in North America, 92 in Greater China (Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan), 6 in Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia and Kazakhstan), three in Singapore, three in South Korea, three in Europe, and one in Japan. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

From quarter to quarter, we are somewhat impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. For example, most Asian markets celebrate their respective local New Year in the first quarter. This generally has a significant impact on the services of our third-party providers, and can negatively impact our net sales. We believe that net sales can also be negatively impacted during the third quarter, when many of our members traditionally take time off for vacations. In addition, the national holidays in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan in early October tend to have an adverse effect on sales in those markets. 

&#160; 

Our spending is affected by the major events planned at different times of the year. A major promotional event could significantly increase the reported expenses during the quarter in which the event actually takes place, while the revenue that might be generated by the event may not occur in the same reporting period. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Most of our products are packaged under a &#8220;private label&#8221; arrangement. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for certain names, logos and various product names in several countries in which we are doing business or considering expanding. We also rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. These common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a United States federal trademark. Common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually utilized, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to discontinue the unauthorized use of the trademark by a third party anywhere in the United States even if the registrant has never used the trademark in the geographic area where the trademark is being used; provided, however, that the unauthorized third party user has not, prior to the registration date, perfected its common law rights in the trademark within that geographic area. 

&#160; 

We have a foreign holding and operating company structure for our non-United States businesses, which involves the division of our United States and non-United States operations. Under this structure, we and some of our United States subsidiaries have granted an exclusive license to some of our non-United States subsidiaries to use outside of the United States all of their intangible property, including trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary information. 

Working with Members 

&#160; 

Sponsorship 

&#160; 

Enrolling new members creates multiple levels in our direct selling structure. The persons that a member enrolls within the network are referred to as &#8220;sponsored&#8221; members, who may purchase solely for their own personal consumption, for resale, or both. Persons newly enrolled are assigned into network positions that can be &#8220;under&#8221; other members, and thus they can be called &#8220;down-line&#8221; members. If down-line members also enroll new members, they create additional levels within the structure, but their down-line members remain in the same down-line network as the original member that introduced them to our business. 

&#160; 

While we provide product samples, brochures and other sales materials, members are primarily responsible for enrolling and educating their new members with respect to products, the compensation plan and how to build a successful membership network. 

&#160; 

Members are not required to enroll other members as their down-line, and we do not pay any commissions for enrolling new members. However, because of the financial incentives provided to those who succeed in building a member network that consumes and resells products, we believe that many of our members attempt, with varying degrees of effort and success, to enroll additional members. Because they are seeking new opportunities for income, people are often attracted to become members after using our products or after attending introductory seminars. Once a person becomes a member, he or she is able to purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices via the internet. The member is also entitled to enroll other members in order to build a network of members and product users. 

&#160; 

Compensation Plans 

&#160; 

We employ what is commonly referred to as a binary compensation plan, enhanced with certain unilevel features. Under our compensation plan, members are paid weekly commissions for product purchases by their down-line member network across all geographic markets, except China, where our subsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay any commissions. This &#8220;seamless&#8221; compensation plan enables a member located in one country to sponsor other members located in other countries. Currently, there are basically two ways in which members can earn income: 

&#8226; 

Through commissions paid on product purchases made by their down-line members; and 

&#8226; 

Through retail markups on sales of products purchased by members at wholesale prices (in some markets, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail mark-ups on sales in that market). 

&#160; 

Each of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per sales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product&#8217;s wholesale price. As the member&#8217;s business expands, the member receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down-line network. To be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of our products. Certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be 

eligible to receive commissions. In determining commissions, the number of levels of down-line members included within the member&#8217;s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the member increases. Under our current compensation plan, some of our commission payout may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of the total product sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited. 

&#160; 

In some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally sponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned by up to three generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn income, trips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we hold from time to time. 

&#160; 

From time to time we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate members, which can have an impact on member commissions. From time to time we also enter into agreements for business or market development, which may result in additional compensation to specific members. 

&#160; 

Member Support 

&#160; 

We are committed to providing a high level of support services tailored to the needs of our members in each marketplace we are serving. We attempt to meet the needs and build the loyalty of members by providing personalized member services and by maintaining a generous product return policy (see &#8220;Product Warranties and Returns&#8221;). We believe that maximizing a member&#8217;s efforts by providing effective member support has been, and could continue to be, important to our success. 

Through product training meetings, regular conventions, web-based messages, member focus groups, regular telephone conference calls and other personal contacts with members, we seek to understand and satisfy the needs of our members. Via our websites, we provide product fulfillment and tracking services that result in user-friendly and timely product distribution. 

&#160; 

To help maintain communication with our members, we offer the following support programs: 

&#8226; 

Teleconferences &#8211; we hold teleconferences with associate field leadership on various subjects such as technical product discussions, member organization building and management techniques. 

&#8226; 

Internet &#8211; we maintain a website at www.nhtglobal.com. On this website, the user can read company news, learn more about various products, sign up to be a member, place orders, and track the fulfillment and delivery of their orders. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Product Literature &#8211; we offer a variety of literature to members, including product catalogs, informational brochures, pamphlets and posters for individual products, which are both printed and available online. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Broadcast E-mail and Text Messages &#8211; we send announcements via e-mail and/or text messages to members who opt in to receive this form of communication. 

&#8226; 

Social Media Tools &#8211; in some countries we maintain country-specific social media sites to foster a community environment around our product offering and business opportunity. 

Technology and Internet Initiatives 

&#160; 

We believe that the internet is important to our business as more consumers communicate online and purchase products over the internet as opposed to traditional retail and direct sales channels. As a result, we have committed significant resources to our e-commerce capabilities and the abilities of our members to take advantage of the internet. Substantially all of our sales take place via the internet. We offer a global web page that allows a member to have a personalized replicating website through which he or she can sell products in all of the countries in which we do business. Links to these websites can be found at our main website for members at www.nhtglobal.com. The information provided on these websites should not be considered part of this report. 

&#160; 

Rules Affecting Members 

&#160; 

Our member policies and procedures establish the rules that members must follow in each market. We also monitor member activity in an attempt to provide our members with a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; so that one member may not be disadvantaged by the activities of another. We require our members to present products and business opportunities in an ethical and professional manner. Members further agree that their presentations to customers must be consistent with, and limited to, the product claims and representations made in our literature. 

&#160; 

Our policies and procedures state that we produce or pre-approve all sales aids used by members such as presentations videotapes, audiotapes, brochures and promotional clothing. Further, members may not use any form of media advertising to promote products unless it is pre-approved by us. Members are not entitled to use our trademarks or other intellectual property without our prior consent. 

&#160; 

Our compliance and member services department reviews reports of alleged member misbehavior. If we determine that a member has violated our member policies or procedures, we may terminate the member&#8217;s rights completely. Alternatively, we may impose sanctions, such as warnings, probation, withdrawal or denial of an award, suspension of privileges of the membership, fines, withholding commissions, until specified conditions are satisfied or other appropriate injunctive relief. Our members are independent contractors, not employees, and may act independently of us. Further, our members may resign or terminate their membership at any time without notice. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Direct Selling Activities 

&#160; 

Direct selling, or multi-level marketing, activities are regulated by various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes. The laws and regulations in our current markets often: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

impose cancellation/product return, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off rights for consumers and members; 

&#8226; 

require us or our members to obtain a license from, or register with, governmental agencies; 

&#8226; 

impose reporting requirements; and 

&#8226; 

impose upon us requirements, such as requiring members to maintain levels of retail sales to qualify to receive commissions, to ensure that members are being compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting new members. 

&#160; 

The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we may be subject from time to time to government reviews, examinations or investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes to our business model and aspects of our global compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and examinations. 

&#160; 

Based on advice of our engaged outside professionals in existing markets, the nature and scope of inquiries from government regulatory authorities and our history of operations in those markets to date, we believe our method of distribution complies in all material respects with the laws and regulations related to direct selling of the countries in which we currently operate. 

&#160; 

At the end of 2005, China adopted new direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that are restrictive and contain various limitations, including a restriction on the ability to pay multi-level compensation to independent members. We are not conducting direct selling in China. Rather, consumers and members purchase our products via our Hong Kong-based website or our e-commerce retail platform in China. The regulatory environment in China is complex, and our operations in China can receive regulatory and media attention. 

&#160; 

The Chinese government scrutinizes activities of direct selling companies. Our business continues to be subject to regulations and examinations by municipal and provincial level regulators. At times, actions by government regulators have impacted our members&#8217; activities in certain locations, and have resulted in a few cases of enforcement actions. In each of these cases, we helped our members with their defense in the legality of their conduct. So far, no material changes to our business model have been required. We expect to receive continued guidance and direction as we work with regulators to address our business model and any changes that need to be made to comply with the direct selling regulations. 

&#160; 

We believe that neither our Hong Kong-based website nor our e-commerce platform in China require a direct selling license in China, which we currently do not hold. We have previously sought to obtain a direct selling license, and in August 2015 initiated the process for submitting a new preliminary application for a direct selling license in China. If we are able to obtain a direct selling license in China, we believe that the incentives inherent in the direct selling model in China would incrementally benefit our existing business. Increased sales in China that could be derived from obtaining a direct selling license may be partially offset by the higher fixed costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of required service 

centers and branch offices. We are unable to predict whether and when we will be successful in obtaining a direct selling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling operations and whether such operations would be profitable. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Our Products 

&#160; 

Our products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities in the United States, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture, State Attorneys General and other state regulatory agencies. In our foreign markets, the products are generally regulated by similar government agencies. 

Our personal care products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can be marketed as a &#8220;cosmetic&#8221; or requires further approval as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug. In the United States, regulation of cosmetics is under the jurisdiction of the FDA. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as &#8220;articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.&#8221; Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, eye and facial makeup preparations, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes and deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. Conversely, a product will not be considered a cosmetic, but may be considered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. A product&#8217;s intended use can be inferred from marketing or product claims. The other markets in which we operate have similar regulations. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regulates the sale and distribution of cosmetics and requires us to have an import business license and to register each personal care product imported into Japan. In Taiwan, all &#8220;medicated&#8221; cosmetic products require registration. In China, personal care products are placed into one of two categories, &#8220;general&#8221; and &#8220;drug.&#8221; Products in both categories require submission of formulas and other information with the health authorities, and drug products require human clinical studies. The product registration process in China for these products can take from nine to more than 18 months or longer. Such regulations in any given market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. The sale of cosmetic products is regulated in the European Union under the European Union Cosmetics Directive, which requires a uniform application for foreign companies making personal care product sales. 

&#160; 

The markets in which we operate all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional health supplements from &#8220;drugs&#8221; or &#8220;pharmaceutical products.&#8221; Because of the varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a &#8220;food&#8221; in certain markets may be treated as a &#8220;pharmaceutical&#8221; in other markets. These regulations may require us to either modify a product or refrain from selling the product in a given market. As a result, we must regularly modify the ingredients and/or the levels of ingredients in our products for certain markets. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign markets may require us to obtain regulatory approval prior to introduction of a new product or limit our uses of certain ingredients altogether. There has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements. This could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. Because of this increased regulatory focus, our internal review efforts have been enhanced in order to comply with our understanding of current regulations. 

&#160; 

FDA regulations require current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) for dietary supplements. The regulations ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include requirements for establishing quality control procedures for us and our vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, and testing ingredients and finished products. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements contain contaminants or do not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded. 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to additional FDA regulations, such as those implementing an adverse event reporting system (&#8220;AER&#8217;s&#8221;), which requires us to document and track adverse events and report serious adverse events, which are events involving hospitalization or death, associated with consumers&#8217; use of our products. 

&#160; 

Most of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products. This is particularly true with respect to our dietary supplements because we typically market them as foods or health foods. For example, in the United States, we are unable to claim that any of our nutritional supplements will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, however, permits substantiated, 

truthful and non-misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being resulting from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or a function of the body. Most of the other markets in which we operate have not adopted similar legislation, although we may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our products in these markets. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Issues 

&#160; 

As a United States entity operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and custom laws that regulate the flow of funds between our subsidiaries and us for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of member commissions. As is the case with most companies that operate in our product categories, we might receive inquiries from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our business and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other laws. 

Product Warranties and Returns 

&#160; 

Our refund policies and procedures closely follow industry and country-specific standards, which vary greatly by country. For example, in the United States, the Direct Selling Association recommends that direct sellers permit returns during the twelve-month period following the sale, while in Hong Kong the standard return policy is 14 days following the sale. Our return policies typically conform to local laws or the recommendation of the local direct selling association. In most cases, members who timely return unopened product that is in resalable condition may receive a refund. The amount of the refund may be dependent on the country in which the sale occurred, the timeliness of the return, and any applicable re-stocking fee. NHT Global must be notified of the return in writing and such written requests would be considered a termination notice of the membership. From time to time, we may alter our return policy in response to special circumstances. 

&#160; 

Our Industry 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the direct selling industry, selling wellness, herbal, beauty, lifestyle and home products. More specifically, we are engaged in what is called network marketing or multi-level marketing. This type of organizational structure and approach to marketing and sales include companies selling lifestyle enhancement products, cosmetics and dietary supplements, or selling other types of consumer products. Generally, direct selling is based upon an organizational structure in which independent members purchasing a company&#8217;s products are compensated for sales made directly to consumers. 

&#160; 

Our members are compensated based on sales generated by members they have enrolled and all subsequent members enrolled by their &#8220;down-line&#8221; network of members. The experience of the direct selling industry has been that once a sizeable network of members is established, new and alternative products and services can be offered to those members for sale to consumers and additional members. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The network marketing industry is very diverse, with giant multinational corporations as well as smaller, local operators. Big network marketing companies include Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc., USANA Health Sciences, Inc., and Herbalife, Ltd, which have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we do and also have many more members. They are publicly traded and therefore serve as informational benchmarks, but we don&#8217;t overlap with them in terms of marketplace or product range. On the other hand, many medium- and small-sized privately held Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies are fierce competitors and are much closer to directly competing with us. Also, a number of our former employees and members now work for competitors, and sometimes try to use relationships and knowledge obtained to compete with us. 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete with other network marketing companies depends, in significant part, on our success in attracting and retaining members. There can be no assurance that our programs for attracting and retaining members will be successful. The pool of individuals interested in network marketing is limited in each market and is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully attract these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe that we offer an attractive opportunity for our members, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing members or deplete the pool of potential members in a given market. 

&#160; 

The direct selling channel tends to sell products at a higher price compared to traditional retailers, which poses a degree of competitive risk. There is no assurance that we would continue to compete effectively against retail stores, internet-based retailers or other direct sellers.
