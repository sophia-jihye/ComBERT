 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, one of the world&#8217;s leading causes of blindness. We have pioneered Micro &#8209;Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. We launched the iStent , our first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and we are leveraging our platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro &#8209;scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. We believe the iStent is the smallest medical device ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide. 

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss caused by optic nerve damage, which is most commonly associated with elevated levels of pressure within the eye, or intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure often occurs when aqueous humor, the thin watery fluid that fills the front part of the eye, is not circulating normally and draining properly. According to Market Scope, more than 80 million people worldwide have glaucoma, a number it expects to grow to more than 90 million by 2020. This estimate includes approximately 4.3 million people with glaucoma in the United States, growing to approximately 4.8 million by 2020. Glaucoma is a chronic condition that progresses slowly over long periods of time and can have a devastating impact on a patient&#8217;s vision and quality of life. 

Reducing intraocular pressure is the only proven treatment for glaucoma. Glaucoma has traditionally been treated through a range of approaches that often require patients to use multiple types of prescription eye drops for the rest of their lives, and sometimes undergo complex and invasive eye surgery. Prescription eye drops, which are estimated to account for approximately $4.7 billion in global sales in 2015, according to Market Scope, are often used to control intraocular pressure throughout glaucoma progression. Unfortunately, these medications can be ineffective over time due to patient noncompliance and other factors. Complex and invasive glaucoma surgical options are typically reserved for more advanced disease and have remained largely unchanged since the 1970&#8217;s. 

We developed MIGS to address the shortcomings of current glaucoma treatment options. MIGS procedures involve the insertion of a micro &#8209;scale device from within the eye&#8217;s anterior chamber through a small corneal incision. MIGS devices reduce intraocular pressure by restoring the natural outflow pathways for aqueous humor. Based on clinical studies and published reports, we believe MIGS procedures are safer, preserve more eye tissue and result in faster recovery times and fewer complications than invasive glaucoma surgical options. 

The iStent is the first commercially available MIGS treatment solution. FDA &#8209;approved for insertion in combination with cataract surgery, the iStent has been shown to lower intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma, which represents the majority of glaucoma cases. The iStent procedure is currently reimbursed by Medicare and a majority of commercial payors and we have sold more than 1 4 0,000 iStent devices worldwide. 

We are building a broad portfolio of micro &#8209;scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression, including three innovative pipeline products: the iStent Inject , the iStent Supra and iDose . The iStent Inject includes two stents pre &#8209;loaded in an auto &#8209;injection inserter. We are developing two versions of this product: the first is currently being studied for lowering intraocular pressure in conjunction with cataract surgery in a U.S. investigational device exemption (IDE) pivotal trial; the second is currently being studied in an initial U.S. IDE study as a standalone treatment for lowering intraocular pressure. This second version is also capable of making its own self &#8209;sealing corneal penetration, potentially offering patient treatment in a minor surgical suite or an in &#8209;office setting. The iStent Supra is designed to access an alternative drainage space within the eye where we estimate 20% of aqueous humor outflow occurs, and is now in a U.S. pivotal IDE trial. iDose is an implant that is designed to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication from within the eye for extended periods of time to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. To validate the safety and efficacy of our iStent products, we are currently conducting 17 prospective clinical trials. 

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters and production facilities are located in Laguna Hills, California, and as of December 31, 2015, we had 182 employees. We have built and are continuing to grow our commercial organization, which includes a direct sales force in the United States, Germany, Australia and Canada, and distribution partners in Europe, Asia Pacific and other targeted international geographies. Information about geog raphic revenue is set forth in Note 1 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Our net sales increased to $71.7 million in 2015 from $45.6 million in 2014 and $20.9 million in 2013 , and our net losses were $38.3 million , $14.1 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

Our Market Opportunity 

According to Market Scope, more than 80 million people worldwide have glaucoma, a number it expects to grow to more than 90 million by 2020. This estimate includes approximately 4.3 million people with glaucoma in the United States, growing to approximately 4.8 million by 2020. Market Scope estimates 2015 global sales of products used to treat glaucoma patients to be approximately $5.1 billion, growing to approximately $7.1 billion in 2020. Open &#8209;angle glaucoma is the most common form of the disease. Approximately 3.5 million people in the United States have open &#8209;angle glaucoma, growing to approximately 3.8 million by 2020 according to Market Scope. Despite therapeutic options that attempt to manage disease progression, researchers estimate that 8.4 million people were bilaterally blind from glaucoma in 2010, with this figure forecasted to rise to 11.1 million by 2020. 

Many factors are driving significant growth in the glaucoma market. Populations worldwide in both mature and emerging markets are growing and aging, while life expectancies continue to rise. Treatment of glaucoma is expected to increase due to better healthcare access globally and advances in glaucoma technology designed to provide earlier diagnosis and more cost &#8209;effective treatment to a larger portion of the glaucoma population. 

Care for glaucoma patients in the United States is administered by many of the approximately 18,900 ophthalmologists who diagnose the disease and provide medical management according to Market Scope. There are more than 8,000 ophthalmic surgeons in the United States focused on performing cataract or glaucoma procedures. These ophthalmic surgeons perform approximately 3.8 million cataract surgeries annually in the United States according to Market Scope. We believe that approximately 20% of cataract surgeries are performed on patients also diagnosed with open &#8209;angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension. Appropriate treatment options are determined based on the progression and severity of the disease and include medical management with prescription pharmaceuticals, laser therapy, surgical therapy and now MIGS. 

Glaucoma Treatment Overview and Limitations 

Glaucoma and the eye&#8217;s drainage system 

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive, irreversible and largely asymptomatic vision loss in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are often associated with optic nerve damage. While some glaucoma patients do not experience an increase in intraocular pressure, it is widely considered a major risk factor in glaucoma&#8217;s progression and reduction in intraocular pressure is the only clinically proven treatment. Elevated intraocular pressure occurs when aqueous humor is not circulating normally and properly drained from the front part of the eye. Normally, this fluid flows through the trabecular meshwork, an area of spongy mesh &#8209;like tissue in the eye located around the base of the cornea, and into Schlemm&#8217;s canal, a circular channel in the eye that collects the aqueous humor and delivers it back into the bloodstream. This trabecular meshwork pathway is also known as the conventional outflow pathway. 

A second outflow pathway is located in the suprachoroidal space, which lies between the sclera and the choroid, where we estimate 20% of the eye&#8217;s total aqueous humor outflow occurs. This pathway is also known as the unconventional or uveoscleral pathway. The suprachoroidal space is characterized as an area of less venous resistance to aqueous humor outflow than Schlemm&#8217;s canal. 

&#160;

The following image depicts the blockage of aqueous humor outflow in an eye with open &#8209;angle glaucoma. 

Open &#8209;angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. In open &#8209;angle glaucoma, structures of the eye may appear normal, but aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork and into Schlemm&#8217;s canal is reduced due to gradual degeneration and obstruction. Direct causes of this blockage are unknown, but the disease is linked to age, ethnicity and hereditary factors. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye. 

Glaucoma is a progressive disease that can be categorized based by severity levels ranging from ocular hypertension (or pre &#8209;glaucoma) to severe glaucoma, as shown in the chart below. According to industry experts, mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate glaucoma patients account for a majority of the population. An eye doctor usually diagnoses glaucoma as part of a comprehensive exam that includes measuring intraocular pressure and corneal thickness, evaluating optic nerve damage and testing visual fields. Intraocular pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), with normal eye pressures ranging from 10 to 21 mm Hg. Glaucoma is typically characterized by an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg. 

An eye doctor will monitor optic nerve damage by tracking the cup to disc (C:D), ratio. This exam measures the diameter of the optic disc (the round area in back of the eye where retinal nerve fiber layers collect to form the optic nerve) relative to the diameter of the optic cup (the center of the optic disc). Expansion and deepening of this optic cup indicates damage. Visual field, or perimetry, tests are used to check for peripheral vision impairment in one or more 

&#160;

quadrants. Once diagnosed, the treatment goal in all cases is to control intraocular pressure. Glaucoma progression stages are described in the following chart.

Filtration surgery or aqueous shunt, a flexible plastic tube with an attached silicone drainage pouch 

Mechanism of action 

Increasing aqueous humor outflow and/or decreasing production of aqueous humor 

SLT laser energy targets melanin &#8209;containing cells in the trabecular meshwork, creating changes in the tissue and improving the aqueous humor outflow 

Creating a drainage channel from the anterior chamber and through the sclera to allow aqueous humor outflow to area beneath the conjunctiva 

Considerations 

Poor patient compliance; complex, frequent and lifelong dosing regimens; loss of effect over time; cost; side effects; contraindications and adverse interactions with other medications 

Effects of surgery dissipate after several years necessitating additional procedures; medication therapy may be necessary post &#8209;treatment 

Little innovation; high failure rates; complication risks; lack of long &#8209;term efficacy; medication therapy may be necessary post &#8209;treatment 

&#160; 

Multiple clinical trials have shown that medications can reduce intraocular pressures to baseline targets that can minimize vision loss. However, poor adherence to and lack of persistence with glaucoma medication regimens have been documented in numerous independent studies, which often place the incidence of patient noncompliance up to or above 50%, particularly in patients on two or more prescription eye drops. Even daily glaucoma single medication use has been associated with noncompliance rates as high as 75%. 

According to Market Scope, more than 47% of patients use two or more prescription eye drops. Furthermore, because glaucoma progresses slowly and with few symptoms, patients often do not adhere to their medication regimens as prescribed until the disease has progressed to the point of significant vision loss. As a result, despite the availability of medication therapies to combat glaucoma, progressive visual loss and blindness still occur. According to a study published in 2014, 15% of glaucoma patients progress to blindness within 20 years of diagnosis. 

Laser treatments have been developed to provide an alternative to lifelong medication treatments. Laser procedures are typically performed at an outpatient surgical center and involve the use of lasers to create changes in eye tissue and improve aqueous humor outflow. Ophthalmic surgeons may perform laser procedures as initial treatment, or for patients who are noncompliant with prescription eye drops or whose intraocular pressure is not well controlled by medications. According to Market Scope, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is the most frequently performed glaucoma laser procedure in the United States. Although SLT can help to lower intraocular pressure, the procedure&#8217;s effectiveness often wears off within one to five years, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. While a second procedure can be performed, the results of repeated laser surgeries are less predictable and less effective than those of the first surgery. Additionally, medication therapy may still be required post &#8209;treatment. 

Where medication therapy and laser treatment are unsuccessful in managing glaucoma, invasive surgical procedures such as trabeculectomies or implantation of tube shunts are performed, usually as outpatient procedures. In a 

&#160;

trabeculectomy, the surgeon cuts open the conjunctiva and sclera to create flaps, and removes a plug of scleral tissue and sometimes a portion of the trabecular meshwork to create an opening into the anterior chamber. The conjunctiva and sclera flaps are sutured back down and a small blister, or bleb, is created between the conjunctiva and sclera. The surgery results in a new drainage channel that allows increased outflow of aqueous humor into the bleb. While some patients experience significant reductions in intraocular pressure, trabeculectomy failure rates can approach 50% according to published research. A common complication is scarring, which can prevent fluid drainage from the eye and interfere with the proper function of the bleb. If the bleb doesn&#8217;t work properly, more surgery may be needed. Among the other complications associated with trabeculectomies are blurred vision, bleeding in the eye, bleb leaks, low intraocular pressure, or hypotony, infection, persistent corneal edema, choroidal detachment and cataract development. Implantations of tube shunts, devices that divert the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber, are generally reserved for eyes in which a trabeculectomy has failed or has a poor likelihood of success. A tube shunt surgery is similar to a trabeculectomy, except that the device&#8217;s tube is inserted through the scleral channel to maintain the channel, and the device&#8217;s reservoir end is placed deep under the conjunctiva to maintain the drainage space. While invasive glaucoma surgery often leads to significant reductions in intraocular pressure, it is associated with high long &#8209;term failure rates, long recovery times and significant complication risks. Additionally, as with laser treatment, the effects may dissipate over time, requiring additional procedures, and medication therapy may still be required post &#8209;treatment. 

We believe that because of the limitations of medications and laser and the morbidity associated with invasive surgical therapies, a clear unmet medical need exists in the management of open &#8209;angle glaucoma patients. 

Our Solution 

We pioneered the development of MIGS in order to address the shortcomings of current pharmaceutical and surgical options, and in doing so have established an entirely new market segment within the global glaucoma marketplace. We believe that by using our core competencies to develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating our proprietary technologies, we have created a platform capable of disrupting and revolutionizing the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. 

In contrast to invasive surgical approaches, MIGS procedures access the anterior chamber of the eye through small corneal incisions or penetrations. MIGS procedures reduce intraocular pressure by restoring the natural physiologic pathways for aqueous humor outflow. Based on clinical studies and published reports, we believe MIGS procedures are safer, preserve more eye tissue and result in faster recovery times and fewer complications than invasive glaucoma surgical options. 

We launched our first micro &#8209;scale MIGS treatment solution, the iStent , in the United States following FDA approval in June 2012. We believe the iStent represents the next generation in glaucoma surgical innovation and it is the first FDA &#8209;approved surgical device available for insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma. The iStent is a micro &#8209;bypass stent made of surgical &#8209;grade non &#8209;ferromagnetic titanium that is coated with heparin. An extensive history of development efforts preceded the current form of the iStent , with contribution by our Caltech &#8209;associated founder, during which more than 80 prototype iterations were produced. Packaged in a sterile, pre &#8209;loaded configuration, the iStent is inserted through the small corneal incision made during cataract surgery and placed into Schlemm&#8217;s canal, a circular channel in the eye that collects aqueous humor and delivers it back into the bloodstream. Once inserted, the iStent improves aqueous humor outflow while fitting naturally within Schlemm&#8217;s canal. The ergonomic rail design protects and accesses underlying collector channels while the iStent &#8217;s three retention arches ensure secure placement. The iStent is currently approved only for insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery because this was the product usage in the U.S. IDE clinical trial information that was included in the premarket approval (PMA). 

The iStent is rated &#8220;MRI Conditional&#8221; by the American Society for Testing and Materials. This means that a patient implanted with the iStent can be scanned safely via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) under the following conditions specified on the product label: static magnetic field of 3 &#8209;Tesla or less, and maximum spat ial magnetic field gradient of 4,000 &#8209;Gauss/cm or less. Therefore, it may not be safe for iStent recipients to undergo MRIs in environments that do not match these specified conditions; however, the vast majority of MRI systems in use in the United States today are rated 3 &#8209;Tesla or less. Following implantation of an iStent , the surgeon is instructed to provide to the patient a wallet &#8209;sized patient identification card citing the model and serial number of the device, implant date, and surgeon&#8217;s 

&#160;

name along with the aforementioned MRI conditions. The surgeon is also instructed to advise the patient that the patient identification card contains important information related to the iStent and that the card should be shown to their current and future health care providers.

&#160; 

In combination with cataract surgery, the iStent has been clinically proven to decrease intraocular pressure. We believe the iStent provides numerous benefits that address the significant unmet need for a durable and effective glaucoma treatment earlier in the treatment paradigm. These benefits include: 

Reduces intraocular pressure. In the pivotal U.S. clinical trial, after one year, 68% of mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma patients who received the iStent in combination with cataract surgery remained medication free while sustaining target intraocular pressures of &#8804; &#160; 21 mm Hg, a level consistent with normal, non &#8209;glaucomatous eyes. In the same trial, 64% of patients who received the iStent remained medication free while sustaining a mean intraocular pressure reduction of 20% compared to baseline. 

Facilitates compliance, convenience. The iStent is designed to establish continuous outflow of aqueous fluid for sustained reduction in intraocular pressure. This mechanism is intended to assure uninterrupted therapy, thus overcoming the primary limitation of patient noncompliance to prescribed eye drop regimens. By reducing intraocular pressure on a sustained basis, iStent efficacy does not depend on patients remembering to use their prescription eye drops. Re &#8209;establishing normal, steady &#8209;state physiologic outflow of aqueous humor may reduce the large fluctuations in intraocular pressure that occur throughout the day in glaucoma patients. These large fluctuations in intraocular pressure have been shown in independent studies to be a significant risk factor in glaucoma progression. 

Safe procedure and rapid recovery. Clinical studies have demonstrated that inserting the iStent in combination with cataract surgery yields an overall safety profile and recovery rate similar to cataract surgery alone, a surgery that has minimal complications and is the most commonly performed ophthalmic procedure today. The iStent procedure is not associated with the complication risks of invasive glaucoma surgery, and it also spares conjunctival tissue, or the clear skin that covers the sclera, enabling rapid recovery and preserving the potential for future glaucoma treatment options. 

Broad segment of ophthalmic practitioners can perform procedure. Because the iStent procedure is straightforward, a broad segment of ophthalmic surgeons can effectively perform the MIGS procedure to insert an iStent . We believe this characteristic increases the procedure&#8217;s appeal and utilization as an early and effective treatment option for ophthalmic surgeons. 

Our Pipeline 

Our research and development goal is to leverage our core capabilities in MIGS &#8209;based design and development to create a full portfolio of micro &#8209;scale injectable therapies for glaucoma management. We have developed a series of innovative products, in varying stages of development, that are designed to expand market penetration and adoption, 

&#160;

further enhance ease of use for surgeons, reach a wider glaucoma patient population and broaden our offering for glaucoma management in order to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression: 

iStent Inject trabecular micro &#8209;bypass stent. The iStent Inject is approximately one &#8209;third the size of the iStent and relies on a similar method of action to improve aqueous humor outflow into Schlemm&#8217;s canal and reduce intraocular pressure. Packaged in a two &#8209;stent, preloaded, auto &#8209;inject mechanism, the iStent Inject allows the surgeon to inject these stents into multiple trabecular meshwork locations through a single corneal entry with the goal of achieving greater intraocular pressure reduction. We are developing two versions of this product. One version of the iStent Inject is currently being evaluated in a pivotal U.S. IDE clinical trial for the reduction of intraocular pressure in mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma in combination with cataract surgery. A second version of the iStent Inject is designed to make its own self &#8209;sealing corneal needle penetration to achieve insertion without an incision. A n initial U.S. IDE study i s currently underway to evaluate this second version of the device as a stand &#8209;alone procedure in glaucoma patients who are not undergoing concurrent cataract surgery. Both versions of the iStent Inject have been approved for marketing in the European Union and Canada and are currently in a commercial launch in Germany and Canada. The version of the iStent Inject that may be used for the reduction of intraocular pressure in mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open angle glaucoma in combination with cataract surgery is approved for marketing and currently in a commercial launch in Australia.

&#160; 

iStent Supra suprachoroidal micro &#8209;bypass stent. The iStent Supra is designed to reduce intraocular pressure by accessing the suprachoroidal space in the eye, an area that we estimate is responsible for 20% of its total aqueous outflow. We believe that the iStent Supra device could be used alone to lower intraocular pressure or in combination with the iStent or the iStent Inject to achieve even lower intraocular pressure in patients with progressive or more advanced open &#8209;angle glaucoma. An international study showed the iStent Supra achieved a 30% pressure reduction in comparison to the unmedicated baseline at 12 months. A U.S. pivotal IDE trial for the iStent Supra used in conjunction with cataract surgery to lower intraocular pressure is underway. The iStent Supra device has already been approved for marketing in the European Union. 

&#160;

&#160; 

iDose. The iDose is a targeted injectable drug delivery implant that uses our micro &#8209;scale platform. The iDose implant is designed to be pre &#8209;loaded into a small gauge needle and injected into the eye via a self &#8209;sealing corneal needle penetration, where it is secured within the eye. Once secured in the eye, the iDose is designed to continuously deliver therapeutic levels of medication from within the eye for extended periods of time. The titanium implant is comparable in size to the Company&#8217;s other proprietary MIGS devices. It is filled with a special formulation of travoprost, a prostaglandin analog used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure. The implant is capped with a membrane that is designed for continuous controlled drug elution into the anterior chamber. When depleted, the implant can be removed and replaced in a similar, subsequent procedure. Glaukos has designed the product to be an alternative to chronic, daily prescription eye drop treatments, which may have high rates of patient noncompliance and cause long &#8209;term ocular surface damage to glaucomatous eyes. In November 2015, the Company submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA seeking authorization to study the iDose delivery system for investigational use in the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. In the IND application, we proposed to conduct a randomized and 12- week masked Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of two models of the iDose delivery system with different travoprost elution rates compared to topical timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5%. In addition, the IND application included information on travoprost&#8217;s history of safety and efficacy, as well as Glaukos&#8217; preclinical program and early data from an initial international clinical trial on the iDose implant involving 69 patients. In this initial international study, subjects were randomized to receive either one of two models of the implant, each with different elution rates, or topical travoprost. Through 12 months, mean intraocular pressure was lower in the implant groups than in the topical medication group. The results from this initial trial demonstrated that both implant models had a potent intraocular pressure &#8209;lowering effect and that the implants were generally well &#8209;tolerated. In December 2015, the FDA allowed the Phase II clinical trial of iDose to proceed. We plan to initiate the Phase II clinical trial for iDose in early 2016. &#160; 

Our injectable therapies could further transform the glaucoma patient value proposition. We believe newly diagnosed glaucoma patients, and mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma patients who have failed on medication therapy, or those who are noncompliant with their prescribed eye drop regimens, could have iStent or iDose injectable therapy as a meaningful alternative to lifelong treatment with prescription eye drops. Our simple, straightforward injectable solutions may reduce the daily need, side effects and cost of prescription eye drops. 

Research &#38; Development 

We are leveraging our micro &#8209;scale technology platform to address the full range of glaucoma disease states and progression and to fundamentally change the way glaucoma patients are treated. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on continuous improvement of our iStent designs and injector systems and improvements to our proprietary MIGS platform. Our research and development objectives are: 

&#183; 

To advance glaucoma patient care through continuous improvement of the MIGS platform, to provide a viable MIGS alternative to lifelong medication regimens and invasive surgical procedures for intraocular pressure management; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

To further transform glaucoma treatment and care by introducing micro &#8209;scale injectable therapies&#8212;including our iStent Inject , iStent Supra and iDose pipeline products&#8212;that can be performed in minor surgical suites or in &#8209;office settings with topical anesthetic. 

As of December 31, 2015, our research and development team consisted of 66 employees. Our research and development process is supported by multiple clinical research programs and regulatory affairs activities. We currently have 17 prospective clinical trials underway. In addition, our technologies have been discussed in 40 articles published in peer &#8209;reviewed journals to date. Our research and development expenses were approximately $ 25.0 million , $19.2 million and $15.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect our research and development expenditures to increase as we continue to devote significant resources to clinical trials and regulatory approvals of our new products. 

iStent clinical validation 

The iStent pivotal U.S. clinical trial that served as the basis for the FDA approval of our PMA application by the FDA was the first prospective, randomized, open &#8209;label, multi &#8209;center, controlled U.S. IDE clinical trial ever to be conducted in support of a glaucoma device. A total of 29 U.S. investigational sites participated in the trial, which demonstrated that insertion of the iStent in patients undergoing cataract surgery provided clinically and statistically significant improvements in intraocular pressure and an overall safety profile similar to cataract surgery alone. 

To be enrolled in the trial, subjects were required to have mild or moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma with visual field or nerve pathology characteristic of glaucoma, a C:D ratio of 0.8 or less, and intraocular pressure &#8804; 24 mm Hg while taking one to three prescription eye drops. After discontinuation of glaucoma medications, intraocular pressure was required to be between 22 mm Hg and 36 mm Hg. Excluded from the trial were individuals with severe glaucomatous field defects, severely uncontrolled intraocular pressure, angle closure glaucoma, neovascular, uveitic or angle recession glaucoma, prior glaucoma surgery other than iridectomy, prior refractive procedures, known corticosteroid responders, ocular disease that would affect safety, monocular subjects or those with fellow eye best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, worse than 20/200. In this study, the &#8220;p&#8221; values were statistical calculations to determine whether the effects of receiving the iStent in conjunction with cataract surgery were significant in comparison to cataract surgery alone based on pre &#8209;specified statistical targets. We specified that any result where p &#8804; .05 would be significant. 

A total of 240 eyes (239 subjects) were randomized, of which 117 were randomized to receive the iStent in conjunction with cataract surgery (treatment group) and 123 to cataract surgery only (control group). Of the 117 eyes randomized to the treatment group, 111 underwent insertion of the iStent in conjunction with cataract surgery. Of the 123 eyes randomized to receive cataract surgery only, 117 eyes underwent cataract surgery. At the 12 &#8209;month visit, subject accountability was 97% in the treatment group and 99% in the control group. After the randomized phase of the trial, an additional 50 subjects were enrolled for the safety purposes in the non &#8209;randomized phase. 

Pivotal trial efficacy data 

Of subjects in the treatment group, 68% achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of an intraocular pressure &#8804; 21 mm Hg without prescription eye drops at 12 months, compared to 50% for the control group (p = 0.004). Of subjects in the treatment group, 64% achieved the secondary efficacy endpoint of intraocular pressure reduction &#8805; 20% without prescription eye drops at 12 months, compared to 47% in the control group (p = 0.010). Throughout the postoperative period, prescription eye drops were prescribed in a lower proportion of patients, and initiated later, in the treatment group than in the control group. At 12 months, 85% of treatment group subjects were medication free compared to 65% of control group subjects at 12 months.

The overall rate of adverse events was similar between the treatment and control groups and no unanticipated adverse device complications were reported. The trial showed that when inserted in conjunction with cataract surgery for subjects with mild &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma, the benefits of the iStent procedure exceeded its risks. 

Additional iStent studies 

Two &#8209;year results from the pivotal trial showed relatively similar outcomes, although it was not designed nor statistically powered for two &#8209;year efficacy endpoints. Numerous other studies performed in Western Europe and the United States evaluating the iStent in combination with cataract surgery have found statistically significant reductions in mean intraocular pressure and medication use. For example, in a prospective, double &#8209;masked, randomized controlled trial on 36 patients with cataract and primary open &#8209;angle glaucoma, patients who received a single iStent in conjunction with cataract surgery showed an intraocular pressure decline to 14.8 mm Hg from 17.9 mm Hg at 15 months. This compared to an intraocular pressure decline to 15.7 mm Hg from 17.3 mm Hg in patients who underwent cataract surgery only. This trial included a washout of medications at 15 months in order to remove the confounding effect of glaucoma medications and, at 16 months, intraocular pressure was 16.6 mm Hg in the combined group, compared to 19.2 mm Hg in the cataract surgery &#8209;only group. 

Two other Western European studies have demonstrated the sustained efficacy and safety of a single iStent inserted in combination with cataract surgery af ter three or more years of post operative follow up. In one international prospective, non &#8209;comparative, uncontrolled, non &#8209;randomized, interventional case series study, 19 subjects with mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma underwent iStent implantation in conjunction with cataract surgery. At a mean follow &#8209;up of 53 months, patients&#8217; mean intraocu l ar pressure was 16.3 mm Hg, compared to preoperative medicated intraocular pressure of 19.4 mm Hg. In 42% of patients, no glaucoma medications were used at the end of follow &#8209;up and the mean number of prescription eye drops used by the patients declined to 0.8 from 1.3 medications preoperatively. 

The other Western European study, a prospective, open &#8209;label, non &#8209;randomized study, assessed the long &#8209;term postoperative outcomes of one iStent implanted during cataract surgery in subjects with primary open &#8209;angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, secondary or post &#8209;traumatic glaucoma or ocular hypertension. There was no preoperative medication washout period and 40% of eyes had undergone previous glaucoma surgeries, primarily laser procedures. In the study, a single iStent was implanted through the same incision used for cataract surgery in a consecutive series of 62 eyes of 43 subjects. In 39 eyes followed through three years, the mean intraocular pressure at three years was 14.9 mm Hg, compared to a mean preoperative intraocular pressure of 23.4 mm Hg, representing a 36% decline. In the same 39 eyes, the mean number of glaucoma medications used three years following surgery declined to 0.3, compared to a mean of 1.9 medications at subjects&#8217; preoperative visits, representing an 86% reduction. No operative complications occurred during the cataract surgical procedure or during the stent implantation procedure. Over the three &#8209;year follow &#8209;up period, five secondary surgeries, two postoperative ocular sequelae and two non &#8209;ocular adverse events were reported. 

&#160;

Additional iStent studies with multiple stents in standalone procedures 

In a prospective, pilot study in Eastern Europe, 39 phakic and pseudophakic subjects with open &#8209;angle glaucoma and preoperative unmedicated intraocular pressure between 22 mm Hg and 38 mm Hg received two iStents in a standalone procedure. At 36 months, subjects not taking medication achieved mean intraocular pressure of 15.2 mm Hg, representing a 37% reduction from unmedicated baseline intraocular pressure. In four subjects who required medication, intraocular pressure ranged from 13 mm Hg to 15.7 mm Hg at 36 months. There were no postoperative adverse events related to stent implantation, except for one incidence of early postoperative hyphema that resolved at one week. The study is designed for follow &#8209;up through five years. 

In another international prospective, randomized study, 119 subjects with open &#8209;angle glaucoma and preoperative unmedicated intraocular pressure between 22 mm Hg and 38 mm Hg received one, two or three iStents in a standalone procedure. In this study, the number of stents was based on randomization and not on each glaucoma patient&#8217;s specific needs. The study design included a primary efficacy endpoint of &#8805; 20% intraocular pressure reduction at 12 months from baseline unmedicated intraocular pressure without use of prescription eye drops or secondary glaucoma procedures. The secondary efficacy endpoint was intraocular pressure &#8804; 18 mm Hg at 12 months without use of prescription eye drops or secondary glaucoma procedures. Approximately 89%, 90% and 92% of the one &#8209;, two &#8209; and three &#8209;stent groups met the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. In addition, at 18 months, mean unmedicated intraocular pressure was 15.9 mm Hg, 14.1 mm Hg and 12.2 mm Hg in the one &#8209;, two &#8209; and three &#8209;stent groups, respectively. No intraoperative ocular adverse events occurred and safety data were similar across all stent groups. By month 18, four eyes had undergone cataract surgery due to progression of cataract. Under the study design, follow &#8209;up will continue through five years. 

To show the benefits of combining trabecular meshwork stents and suprachoroidal stents to achieve dual physiologic outflow in patients with severe glaucoma, 80 failed trabeculectomy patients received two iStents, one iStent Supra and one prescription eye drop in an international study. In 49 patients followed through 12 months, mean intraocular pressure declined 49% to 13.4 mm Hg, compared to a baseline intraocular pressure of 26.4 mm Hg. In addition, 100% of patients met the primary endpoint of &#8805; 20% reduction in intraocular pressure at 12 months. 

Sales and Marketing 

In the United States, we sell our products through a direct sales organization that, as of December 31, 2015, consisted of 65 sales professionals, including regional business managers, sales directors, clinical relations personnel and reimbursement specialists. Our sales organization is primarily responsible for training ophthalmic surgeons on the iStent procedure, helping these physicians integrate the technology into their practices and providing resources to support reimbursement, while also identifying and supporting investigational sites for clinical trials of our pipeline technologies. We continue to recruit experienced sales professionals with extensive sales and/or clinical experience in ophthalmic medical technologies. Our weighted average number of domestic sales representatives increased to 45 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 35 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The higher number of sales representatives in each period helped increase our customer base, leading to growth in unit sales. Increased unit volume was responsible for the majority of the increase in net sales for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015. 

We invest significant time and expense to provide comprehensive training to our sales professionals so that they are proficient in all aspects of our iStent technologies, including features and benefits, procedure techniques and reimbursement. In addition, we provide technical education regarding the eye&#8217;s anatomy, glaucoma diagnosis, disease states and treatment, and cataract surgery. 

Outside the United States, we sell our products primarily through a network of distribution partners located in markets where we see the greatest potential for iStent adoption. In late 2013, we formed a wholly &#8209;owned subsidiary in Germany that employs five direct sales representatives. In early 2015, we formed a wholly &#8209;owned subsidiary in Japan that employs five direct sales representatives. We intend for this subsidiary to commence a commercial launch in the event we receive regulatory approval to market the iStent in Japan. Following our initial public offering (IPO), we formed wholly &#8209;owned subsidiaries in Australia and Canada. In Australia, we have hired a general manager and five direct sales representatives who commenced a commercial launch in January 2016. In Canada, we have hired a general manager and five direct sales representatives who commenced a commercial launch in January 2016. We continually 

&#160;

monitor our international sales progress and will consider conversion to a direct sales approach on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis, depending on our assessment of market conditions, net sales and profitability trends, reimbursement coding and coverage potential, and other factors. As of December 31, 2015, we had agreements with approximately 1 7 distributor organizations. No single distributor accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 201 5 , 2014 or 201 3 . 

Our global sales efforts and promotional activities are currently aimed at ophthalmic surgeons and other eye care professionals. Our primary customers include ophthalmic surgeons, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). We require physicians to complete a mandatory training program before commencing iStent procedures. To facilitate this, we have developed a multi &#8209;faceted education program that includes interactive webinars, wet &#8209;lab training, in &#8209;office didactic sessions, observation of surgical cases and off &#8209;site information seminars. We also offer physician &#8209;to &#8209;physi cian training that involves pre operative diagnostics , procedure assistance and post operative consultations. We believe our education and training programs enable ophthalmic surgeons and other eye care professionals to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction with the iStent and procedure. 

We support our sales organization with marketing programs and initiatives designed to build awareness and appreciation for our iStent technologies. These include advertisements and editorial coverage in professional publications, exhibits at major ophthalmic congresses and meetings, MIGS and iStent user meetings, and targeted direct &#8209;to &#8209;consumer marketing efforts. 

Reimbursement 

United States reimbursement 

Reimbursement for iStent procedure 

There are three key aspects of reimbursement in the United States: 

&#183; 

Coding refers to distinct numeric and alphanumeric billing codes that are used by healthcare providers to report the provision of medical procedures and the use of supplies for specific patients to payors. There are different categories of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Category I, II and III) based on the procedure or supply. 

&#183; 

Coverage refers to decisions made by individual payors as to whether or not to pay for a specific procedure and related supplies and if so, under what conditions ( i.e. , for which specific diagnoses and clinical indications). Payors typically base coverage decisions on reviews of the published medical literature. 

&#183; 

Payment refers to the amount paid to providers for specific procedures and supplies. Payment is generally determined for the specific billing code and, in addition, there may be separate numeric codes, under which the billing code is classified, to establish a payment amount. 

In 2008, in consultation with and with the approval of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, we applied for and received a temporary Category III CPT code to describe insertion of devices such as the iStent using MIGS procedures. 

Category III codes expire five years after the date they become effective. Prior to expiration, there are two options: submit an application to convert to a Category I code; or submit an application for a five year extension of Category III status. CPT code 0191T, which describes the insertion of the iStent and iStent Inject devices, first became effective in 2008. Prior to expiration, an application for a five - year extension was approved in 2012 and expires on December 31, 2018 . We will need to either submit an application to convert CPT code 0191T to a Category I code or apply for another five-year extension by June 2017 in order for the new code to be effective &#160; by January 1, 2019 . 

We also successfully applied for, and the American Medical Association created, a new CPT code 0253T, which describes the insertion of the iStent Supra device, in 2011. An application for a five - year extension was approved at the same time as the application for the extension of CPT code 0191T. We will need to either submit an application for a Category I code or apply for another five &#8209;year extension by June 2017. 

&#160;

The iStent is approved by the FDA for reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma undergoing cataract surgery who are currently treated with prescription eye drops. Based on data released by Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding total cataract surgery volume in the Medicare Fee for Service program and data published by Market Scope, we estimate that Medicare pays for 70% of all cataract surgeries performed in the United States. Due primarily to strong published clinical data, including the FDA pivotal trial, all MACs had begun covering the iStent procedure by February 2013, approximately seven months after FDA approval. 

We estimate that 20% of patients who meet the FDA indication for iStent insertion are covered by private health insurance companies, and we have secured positive coverage policies for iStent insertion with many of these private payors. As of December 31, 2015, we had secured reimbursement for the iStent insertion for approximately 80% of individuals covered by private insurance . These include United HealthCare, CIGNA, Aetna and all Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) plans except Anthem BCBS , Humana and Tricare . The positive coverage by most of the BCBS plans is a result of medical policy issued by the BCBS Association (national) in October 2013 stating that iStent insertion is considered medically necessary for mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209;angle glaucoma patients undergoing cataract surgery. While BCBS plans, which are independent licensees, are not required to follow BCBS national guidelines, the majority of the plans do so. We continue to work with private insurance providers in an effort to broaden coverage for the iStent procedure. 

iStent insertion in the United States is almost always performed in an outpatient setting and virtually all U.S. iStent sales are to ASCs and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). At the average facility, 70% of claims reporting iStent insertion with cataract surgery will be processed and paid for by Medicare. National payment rates by Medicare to ASCs and HOPDs are determined each year through a complex formula, which takes into account reported costs for each claim submitted. When two procedures are performed in an ASC on the same patient on the same day ( e.g. , iStent insertion and cataract surgery), Medicare reduces the payment of the lower &#8209;paying procedure by 50%. The ASC facility payment for cataract surgery is generally lower than the payment for iStent insertion. Therefore, when these two procedures are performed together in an ASC, the payment for cataract surgery is reduced by 50%. We believe that the incremental payment the ASC facility receives for performing iStent insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery over and above what the facility would receive for performing cataract surgery alone covers the cost of the iStent device and the profit for the facility. The incremental ASC facility payment has remained relatively stable over the past few years, however there is no assurance that this payment will remain stable in the future. If the incremental facility payment were to decrease such that it did not cover the cost of the iStent device, it could reduce the profit margin of the ASC where the cataract surgery is performed, make it difficult for existing customers to continue using, or new customers to adopt, our products and create additional pricing pressure for us. 

Reimbursement for iStent insertion and cataract procedures performed in HOPDs was similar to ASCs until CMS implemented a rule change, effective January 1, 2016, reflecting a trend by CMS of bundling payment for procedures that are clinically similar and performed at the same time in HOPDs. Procedures covered by these combined reimbursement codes are grouped into levels and reimbursed with a single, all &#8209;inclusive payment. As a result of this recent rule change, CMS combined the cataract and MIGS/ iStent procedure within a single comprehensive reimbursement code, which eliminated the separate 50% facility reimbursement for the cataract portion of the procedure when performed in the HOPD. While this change will result in lower Medicare fee &#8209;for &#8209;service reimbursement when iStent and cataract procedures are performed at the same time in HOPDs, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our 2016 iStent utilization rates. We intend to preserve our current HOPD pricing on the iStent device. We estimate that approximately 25% of US iStent procedures are currently performed in HOPDs but only a portion of these procedures are reimbursed through traditional Medicare fee &#8209;for &#8209;service. This change will likely reduce the profit margin of the iStent and cataract procedure for some HOPD customers and could potentially make it more difficult for some existing HOPD customers to continue using, or new HOPD customers to adopt, our products and could create additional pricing pressure on the iStent implant. 

Physicians are paid separately from the facility for surgical procedures. Unlike the facility payment, for the CPT code that describes iStent insertion, there is no published Medicare payment schedule at the national level, and the physician payment rate is left to the discretion of the individual Medicare contractor. In order to adopt a new procedure, one of the factors that the surgeon evaluates is whether or not payment for the procedure adequately covers the surgeon&#8217;s time. As with the facility payment, the incremental payment the physician receives for inserting the iStent device in conjunction with cataract surgery over and above what he or she would receive for performing cataract surgery alone 

&#160;

plays a role in a surgeon&#8217;s decision to adopt the technology. We estimate that the national average incremental payment is approximately $500. 

Unlike Medicare, commercial payors do not publish fee schedules. In general, based on selected feedback from facilities and surgeons, payments for iStent insertion from the commercial payors who cover the procedure generally run somewhat higher than the comparable local Medicare payment. 

Reimbursement for future products 

We have also filed and received approval of applications for CPT codes that describe our pipeline iStent devices. Our application for a CPT code to describe insertion of the iStent Supra was approved by the American Medical Association, or AMA, in 2011 resulting in the creation of Category III CPT code 0253T. Our application for a CPT code to describe the insertion of additional trabecular meshwork stents (as with the iStent Inject procedure) was approved by the AMA in early 2014 resulting in the creation of Category III CPT code 0376T. While this code was available beginning on January 1, 2015, for the reporting of procedures in which more than one iStent is inserted in the same eye, it currently does not result in any incremental facility or professional fee payment from Medicare. In addition, it is unclear whether any other third &#8209;party payor will cover the insertion of a second stent or that payment for a second stent will be adequate. 

Reimbursement outside the United States 

Reimbursement in Europe 

In most of the developed European countries, healthcare is funded by the central government. In general, obtaining broad &#8209;based reimbursement and adequate payment for new technologies is more difficult in these markets than in the United States. As with the United States, high &#8209;quality published clinical data ( i.e. , randomized, controlled trials) is required to obtain coverage. However, most of the developed European countries require new medical technologies to not only be safe and effective, but also to be able to demonstrate clinical benefits that outweigh the costs when compared to the standard of care. Conversely, while some U.S. private insurers take cost into consideration, Medicare by law does not consider cost in its coverage decisions. 

Our primary focus has been on the U.S. market and we are in the early stages of commercialization in Europe. With regard to reimbursement in the larger developed countries, we have made the most progress in Germany. Prior to 2013, surgeons in Germany who implanted the iStent used a code for a general glaucoma operation. This code was only payable in the hospital inpatient setting and, although the payment was sufficient to cover the cost of the iStent and payment to the surgeon, the requirement of an overnight stay in the hospital was a significant barrier to adoption. Effective January 1, 2013, there is a specific code (5 &#8209;133.9) describing implantation of a trabecular stent ( e.g. , the iStent and iStent Inject ). This code was added to the Einheitlicher Bewertungsma&#223;stab (EBM) or Unified Rating Scale of procedures that are payable in the outpatient setting. The 5 &#8209;133.9 code can be reported in conjunction with cataract surgery or as a stand &#8209;alone procedure. In addition, the payment to the surgeon for 5 &#8209;133.9 is considered adequate to cover the surgeon&#8217;s costs ( i.e. , time) for inserting the iStent . Also, under the EBM, the cost of the implant can be passed through to the payor. 

Although under German law healthcare is a universal right, and approximately 90% of the population is covered under the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) or public plan, coverage decisions and payment are decentralized. Physicians who treat SHI patients must belong to a Kassen&#228;rztliche Vereinigung (KV) or Physician&#8217;s Association. There are 17 KVs in Germany, and the KVs are responsible for negotiating the budget with the State Sickness Fund for physician and facility payments for outpatient procedures in their region. Generally, procedures that are added to the EBM are covered and paid for by the KVs; however, this is not automatic and the process of achieving routine payment for a new procedure listed on the EBM can take several months. With several KVs, an application must be made to the KV by a surgeon in that area who wishes to perform the procedure. In some cases, the addition of a new outpatient procedure can create budget issues and there can be a delay while the KV negotiates additional funds with the State Sickness Fund to cover payment for the new procedure. 

&#160;

Surgeons in each of the states continue to work to gain KV approval so that claims are processed smoothly. While the majority of claims submitted to KVs in 2015 were processed and paid, some were denied . We are working with reimbursement consultants in Germany who have a successful track record of securing adequate payment for new medical technologies. In light of the strong favorable clinical data for iStent , we anticipate that reimbursement will continue to improve in Germany. 

Under German law, if a person has an income above a certain level, that person can opt out of the SHI and obtain private insurance. Approximately 10% of Germans have opted out and are covered by private insurance companies. Each of these private insurance companies makes its own decisions on individual claims. In general, the private insurance companies cover and pay for outpatient procedures listed on the EBM and that has been our experience to date with iStent insertion. 

We have also made significant progress in reimbursement in Switzerland where the procedure that describes iStent insertion is on the list of approved outpatient procedures. This also means that the costs of any implants or supplies used during these procedures can be passed through for payment. Like Germany, coverage and payment decisions are decentralized, with 26 cantons and numerous private insurers determining coverage. To date, the vast majority of claims for iStent procedures have been processed and paid with no issues. 

In France, our application for a code to describe iStent insertion and our application to add the iStent to the list of devices approved for pass through payment were denied in 2013. Following the publication of data on iStent Inject , we submitted new applications for both devices in 2014. In November 2015, the French government approved the iStent application for reimbursement. Unless there is a code and listing on the pass through list, the only opportunity for payment for the iStent in France would result from successful negotiations at the individual hospital level. There can be no assurance that the French government will approve pass through payment for iStent even though iStent has been approved for reimbursement. 

In the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, there are no codes that specifically describe the insertion of a trabecular stent. We do not anticipate this changing in Spain and Italy in the near future. In addition, there is no mechanism to provide incremental payment for the iStent when insertion is in conjunction with cataract surgery. Our success to date relies on our distributors in these countries negotiating with individual hospitals to cover the cost of inserting the iStent . 

Reimbursement in other regions 

We currently market the iStent in Australia , New Zealand and Canada . In Australia, we have been successful at including the iStent and iStent Inject on the pass through list so that the cost of the device is paid separately. In New Zealand, the vast majority of the population is covered under a publicly &#8209;funded, universal &#8209;coverage health system, with services provided by public, private and non &#8209;governmental sectors. W e have yet to achieve significant success with any of the public and major private payors in New Zealand . In Canada, the iStent &#160; and iStent Inject is paid through individual hospital budgets for glaucoma implants. We have yet to achieve a special funding pathway for iStent &#160; and iStent Inject in Canada and we will be subject to the limitation s of individual hospital budgets until Canadian Provinces provide a special funding pathway for our products. 

Although we are not yet commercial in Japan, we believe that the current reimbursement structure that would apply to iStent insertion in conjunction with cataract surgery may support adequate reimbursement to both the facility and physician. 

Competition 

We are positioning our products and MIGS procedures for use instead of, or in combination with, prescription eye drop therapies that currently dominate the glaucoma treatment marketplace. To a lesser extent, we also compete with manufacturers of medical devices used in other surgical therapy procedures for treating glaucoma, including laser as well as more complex and invasive surgeries. 

&#160;

Many of our current and future competitors are large public companies or divisions of publicly &#8209;traded companies and have several competitive advantages, including: 

&#183; 

greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation; 

&#183; 

significantly greater name recognition; 

&#183; 

longer operating histories; 

&#183; 

established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers and third &#8209;party payors; 

&#183; 

additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives; 

&#183; 

more established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks; and 

&#183; 

greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, preparing regulatory submissions and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for drug and device products and marketing approved products. 

Companies with competing products include Alcon, Inc. , a division of Novartis International &#160; AG (which has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Transcend Medical, Inc. (Transcend) , a MIGS competitor), Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Allergan plc (which has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Pfizer, Inc., pursuant to which the two companies intend to combine), STAAR Surgical Company, Lumenis Ltd., NeoMedix,Inc. and Ellex Medical Lasers Limited. Alcon, Inc. and Abbott Medical Optics Inc. are the leading manufacturers of aqueous shunts, and Alcon, Inc. also markets the EX &#8209;PRESS Glaucoma Filtration Device and, upon its completion of the Transcend acquisition, will be a manufacturer of a MIGS device. Lumenis Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of SLT equipment. Neo M edix, Inc. markets an electrosurgical device and Ellex Medical Lasers Limited markets a canaloplasty device that some physicians employ to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma. 

In addition to these current competitors, we may also in the future compete with manufacturers of alternative technologies to treat glaucoma. We are aware of several companies, including Transcend (which has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Alcon, Inc . ), AqueSys, Inc. (which was recently acquired by Allergan plc, a publicly traded company, which has entered into a definitive merger agreement with Pfizer, Inc., pursuant to which the two companies intend to combine), InnFocus Inc. and Ivantis Inc. , that are conducting FDA &#8209;approved IDE clinical trials or have filed for regulatory approval of MIGS devices. These products or other products that may be developed could demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, ease of use or lower costs than our iStent or other products under development. If approved for marketing, these devices may compete directly with the iStent and our products under development. If any of these alternative technologies gain market acceptance, this may reduce demand for our primary product, the iStent , as well as for our products in development . 

In addition to competing for market share for our products, we also compete against these companies for personnel, including qualified sales representatives that are necessary to grow our business, as well as scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions that are important to our research and development efforts. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

&#183; 

improved outcomes for glaucoma; 

&#183; 

acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons; 

&#183; 

ease of use and reliability; 

&#183; 

product price and availability of reimbursement; 

&#183; 

technical leadership; 

&#183; 

effective marketing and distribution; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

speed to market. 

Facilities, Manufacturing and Distribution 

We occupy approximately 2 3 , 915 square feet at our corporate headquarters &#160; facilities located in Laguna Hills, California under a lease that expires on September 30, 2016. All of our headquarters &#8209;based employees, including our manufacturing and dis tribution employees, work at these &#160; facilit ies . While these facilit ies are sufficient for our current needs, we will require additional space as our business expands. Accordingly, we entered into a sublease for an approximately 37,700 square foot facility located in San Clemente, California effective September 1, 2015, as well as a five &#8209;year lease for these premises that takes effect January 1, 2017 upon expiration of the sublease. We plan for this facility to serve as our headquarters beginning sometime in 2016. Our international subsidiaries also lease facilities in Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan. 

We manufacture, inspect, package and ship finished products from our Laguna Hills facility. We source components used in our proprietary manufacturing process from outside vendors and we assemble them to produce iStent devices and disposable insertion instruments. These components include both off &#8209;the &#8209;shelf materials and custom made parts. The iStent device and some insertion instrument components are supplied by single vendors. While we believe that there are at least several other vendors that could make any one of these items, we maintain a minimum inventory of three to six months&#8217; supply to help mitigate any supply interruptions. We source the heparin used in our iStent heparin coating from one supplier. We maintain a stock of several years&#8217; worth of heparin material and have FDA approval to retest and extend the shelf life of the material indefinitely for U.S. product. 

We have received International Standards Organization (ISO) 13485 certification, which includes design control requirements. Our manufacturing processes have been validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facility and the facilities of our critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. To date, FDA and CE manufacturing audits conducted at our facilities have noted no significant deficiencies or findings requiring remediation. 

We have significantly increased manufacturing output since the commercial launch of the iStent in 2012. We believe we are well &#8209;positioned to continue advancing our manufacturing technology, capacity and efficiency going forward. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that the strength of our competitive position will depend substantially upon our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights protecting our technology. We file for patents for new patentable technologies relevant to our business and utilize other forms of intellectual property protection to strategically protect our intellectual property. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio can be leveraged into new products and potential additional indications for our technology. In addition, we may also review and attempt to acquire rights in third &#8209;party patents and applications that are strategically valuable to us. 

Patents 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or exclusively licensed in certain fields of use 124 issued patents, of which we owned 52 that were issued in the United States and 61 that were issued outside of the United States, and 80 pending patent applications, of which we owned 29 that were filed in the United States and 21 that were filed outside of the United States. We also granted to DOSE Medical certain exclusive rights and licenses outside our licensed fields of use under certain of our owned patents and patent applications. Our issued patents that protect our commercial products and current product pipeline will expire between 2020 and 2033. While we have pursued and continue to pursue patent protection for our technologies, we may, from time to time, abandon certain patents and patent applications for business reasons. 

Our U.S. patents include a variety of claims related to devices and methods for treating glaucoma with ab &#8209;interno surgical procedures, which are procedures initiated from within the anterior chamber of the eye and accessed 

&#160;

through an opening in the clear corneal tissue. Our pending U.S. patent applications, if issued with their present claims, relate to the same field and potentially other fields of use. 

From March 2013 to October 2015, we were engaged in a dispute with Transcend ( which has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Alcon, Inc., a divisi on of Novartis International AG ) as to whether or not Transcend&#8217;s CyPass Micro &#8209;Stent infringed our patents. On October 29, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with Transcend to resolve the patent litigation then pending between us before the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Under the settlement agreement, we granted Transcend a covenant not to sue Transcend for patent infringement in connection with Transcend&#8217;s CyPass Micro &#8209;Stent devices, appliers and delivery systems. In exchange, Transcend granted us a conditional covenant not to challenge the validity or enforceability of any of our patents and will make quarterly payments to us equal to 1% of future net sales of the CyPass Micro &#8209;Stent devices until April 8, 2022 or up to a maximum aggregate payment amount of $6.0 million. In connection with our settlement, we filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice of all of our respective claims against each other in this matter, with each of us responsible for our own legal expenses. The court dismissed the matter with prejudice on October 29, 2015, thereby eliminating the need for the trial, which was scheduled to begin on November 2, 2015. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, we agreed to pay The Regents of The University of California (the University) 33% of any payments we receive from Transcend pursuant to the settlement agreement. For additional information relating to our agreement with the University, see &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8212;Intellectual property agreements.&#8221; 

Before dismissal, the court ruled on Transcend&#8217;s motion for summary judgment on various invalidity grounds. While the court denied Transcend summary judgment on almost all grounds, the court did issue an order granting summary judgment that certain dependent claims using the term &#8220;choroid&#8221; were indefinite and invalid. Although this order did not become a final judgment due to the dismissal, there would be no guarantee that the order would not negatively affect an analysis of the validity of these claims in addition to a limited number of claims in other patents that we own covering the iStent Supra if such patents are challenged in the future. 

The ophthalmology industry in which we operate has been subject to a large number of patent filings and patent infringement litigation. Whether we infringe any patent claim owned by a third party will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent claim in the context of litigation. If an infringement allegation is made against us, we may seek to invalidate the asserted patent claim and may allege non &#8209;infringement of the asserted patent claim. Also, for business reasons, we may take similar actions before any such infringement allegation is made. In order for us to invalidate a U.S. patent claim, we would need to rebut the presumption of validity afforded to issued patents in the United States with clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Similar or greater effort and proof may be required to invalidate foreign patents owned by third parties, including those owned by our competitors. 

Trademarks 

Glaukos, our logo, iStent, iStent Supra, iStent Inject and iPrism are registered trademarks of our company in the United States. Glaukos, iStent, iStent Inject, iStent Supra and iDose are registered trademarks of our company in the European Union. We have registered trademarks for Glaukos in Canada, Japan and Mexico. We have registered trademarks for iStent in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico and Switzerland. We have pending trademark applications for iStent in Argentina, Brazil and Columbia. We have a pending trademark application for iDose TR in the United States. We have pending trademark applications for iDose in Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States. We have pending trademark applications for iPrism in Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan. We have pending trademark applications for iStent Inject in Australia, Canada and Japan. We also use MIGS as an unregistered trademark . 

Trade secrets 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and manufacturing process in part by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment unless excluded pursuant to California Labor Code Section 2870. These agreements further prohibit our employees from using, disclosing, or bringing onto the premises any proprietary information belonging to a third party. In addition, most of our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors are required to sign 

&#160;

agreements under which they must assign to us any inventions that relate to our business. These agreements also prohibit these third parties from incorporating into any inventions the proprietary rights of third parties without informing us. It is our policy to require all employees to document potential inventions and other intellectual property in laboratory notebooks and to disclose inventions to patent counsel using invention disclosure forms. 

We also rely on confidentiality restrictions and trade secret protection to protect our technology. We generally require our consultants and other parties who may be exposed to our proprietary technology to sign non &#8209;disclosure agreements that prohibit such parties from disclosing or using our proprietary information except as may be authorized by us. 

We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know &#8209;how and inventions. 

Intellectual property agreements 

In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with GMP Vision Solutions, Inc. (GMP) to acquire certain in &#8209;process research and development. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to make periodic royalty payments based on revenues received for royalty &#8209;bearing products and periodic royalty payments at a higher rate for all amounts received in connection with the grant of licenses or sublicenses of the related intellectual property. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with GMP pursuant to which we paid GMP $1.0 million for a 90 &#8209;day option to buy out all remaining royalties payable to GMP. In April 2013, the option expired unexercised and as provided in the agreement, the $1.0 million payment satisfied the obligation to pay the first $1.0 million in royalties earned beginning on January 1, 2013. 

In November 2013, we entered into an agreement with GMP pursuant to which we bought out all remaining royalties payable to GMP in exchange for the issuance of $17.5 million in promissory notes payable to GMP and a party related to GMP. For additional information relating to the terms of these notes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Indebtedness.&#8221; 

In December 2014, we entered into an agreement with the University to quiet title to our entire ownership of certain patents and patent applications, or the Patent Rights, to which Dr. Richard Hill contributed while he was both a consultant for us and a faculty member at the University. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to pay to the University $2.7 million in 2015 and to make periodic payments to the University equal to a low single &#8209;digit percentage of worldwide net sales, beginning in 2015, of certain current and future products, including our iStent products, with a required minimum annual payment of $500,000 during the term of the agreement. The University has a security interest in all tangible assets owned by us. Our agreement with the University will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the Patent Rights, which is currently expected to be in 2022. 

On October 29, 2015, we entered into the settlement agreement with Transcend (which has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Alcon, Inc., a division of Novartis International AG, which is a publicly traded multinational pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland) whereby we granted Transcend a covenant not to sue for patent infringement in connection with certain Transcend products and released Transcend from any and all liability for past infringement of our patents. Transcend granted us a conditional covenant not to challenge the validity or enforceability of any of our patents, and agreed to make royalty payments equal to 1% of future net sales of certain Transcend products in countries where we have patent protection. Transcend&#8217;s royalty obligation continues until April 8, 2022, or up to a maximum aggregate payment amount of $6.0 million, whichever occurs first. In connection with entering into the settlement agreement, we agreed to pay the University 33% of any payments we receive from Transcend pursuant to the settlement agreement . 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices (such as iStent ), as well as combination drug/device products (such as iDose ) in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny. 

U.S. government regulation&#8212;medical devices 

Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 

Device classification 

Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non &#8209;misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 

Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; as defined in the statute, to either: 

&#183; 

a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 

&#183; 

another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. 

To be &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. 

After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which 

&#160;

may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements. 

If the FDA determines that the device is not &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. 

Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life &#8209;supporting or life &#8209;sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre &#8209;clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 

The investigational device process 

In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present &#8220;non &#8209;significant risk&#8221; are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is obtained. If the device presents a &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA&#8217;s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. 

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA&#8217;s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and 

&#160;

efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#183; 

the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 

&#183; 

patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 

&#183; 

patients do not comply with trial protocols; 

&#183; 

patient follow &#8209;up is not at the rate expected; 

&#183; 

patients experience adverse events; 

&#183; 

patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial; 

&#183; 

device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences; 

&#183; 

institutional review boards and third &#8209;party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 

&#183; 

third &#8209;party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; 

&#183; 

we or third &#8209;party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 

&#183; 

third &#8209;party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 

&#183; 

regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 

&#183; 

changes in government regulations or administrative actions; 

&#183; 

the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or 

&#183; 

the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 

The PMA approval process 

Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant&#8217;s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information ( e.g. , major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee&#8217;s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and 

&#160;

three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 

&#183; 

the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction; 

&#183; 

the data from pre &#8209;clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 

&#183; 

the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 

&#183; 

changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. 

In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require postmarket surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life &#8209;supporting or life &#8209;sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post &#8209;approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. 

Because of the indication we chose to pursue for the iStent in the United States, the FDA required that we undergo the more rigorous PMA process. The majority of the devices currently marketed in the United States for the treatment of glaucoma have been cleared via the 510(k) process. The FDA considered the iStent to be a &#8220;first in class&#8221; device that was not substantially equivalent to any currently marketed device. 

The FDA approved the iStent PMA on June 25, 2012, for the indication for use in combination with cataract surgery for the reduction of intraocular pressure in adult patients with mild &#8209;to &#8209;moderate open &#8209; angle glaucoma currently treated with prescription eye drops. The FDA imposed conditions of approval, including three postmarket studies, and a requirement that we implement a three &#8209;part training program for physicians who will use the iStent device. 

We are required to file new PMA applications or PMA supplement applications for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device for which we have received approval through the PMA approval process. 

&#160;

Post &#8209;approval requirements 

After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to: 

&#183; 

the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution; 

&#183; 

the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third &#8209;party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 

&#183; 

labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements; 

&#183; 

advertising and promotion requirements; 

&#183; 

restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 

&#183; 

PMA annual reporting requirements; 

&#183; 

the FDA&#8217;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off &#8209;label&#8221; uses; 

&#183; 

the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur; 

&#183; 

medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 

&#183; 

recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 

&#183; 

an order of repair, replacement or refund; 

&#183; 

device tracking requirements; and 

&#183; 

postapproval study and postmarket surveillance requirements. 

Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution. 

U.S. government regulation&#8212;drug delivery implant 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and combination drug/device products under the FDCA and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations, which along with the FDCA govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post &#8209;approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug product development process, approval process or post &#8209;approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of 

&#160;

profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or other governmental entities. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices; 

&#183; 

the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials commence in the United States; 

&#183; 

approval by an IRB at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#183; 

obtaining informed consent from the participants in a clinical trial; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each intended use and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP); 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre &#8209;approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#183; 

the submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#183; 

FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA. 

The investigational new drug process 

An IND application is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be obtained prior to administration to humans of any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, that is not the subject of an approved new drug application, or NDA, except under limited circumstances. 

To conduct a clinical study of an investigational new drug product, we are required to file an IND with the FDA. The IND submission must include the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies, as well as results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND. If FDA raises questions, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from the IRB at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The IRB must also monitor the trial until completed. All participants in our clinical trials must provide their informed consent in writing. In addition, there are requirements and industry guidelines that require the posting of ongoing clinical trials on public registries, and the disclosure of designated clinical trial results. The IRB must also review and approve all clinical trial recruitment plans and materials. 

&#160;

The clinical investigation of an investigational drug product is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of investigational new drug investigation are as follows: 

&#183; 

Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well &#8209;controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#183; 

Phase II. Phase II includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug product. Phase II clinical trials are typically well &#8209;controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 

&#183; 

Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit &#8209;risk profile of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and adequate information for product labeling. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well &#8209;controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA has the legal discretion to approve a drug on the basis of a single well &#8209;controlled clinical trial. In practice, the agency often requires that such a trial meet higher standards in terms of size, robustness and statistical significance, and it may restrict approval on the basis of single trial to situations in which there is a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 

The FDA&#8217;s primary objectives in reviewing an IND are to assure the safety and rights of patients and to help assure that the quality of the investigation will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug&#8217;s effectiveness and safety. The decision to terminate development of an investigational drug product may be made by either the FDA, an IRB or ethics committee, or by the study sponsor for various reasons. Clinical trials may be overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable risk to health. Other reasons for suspension or termination may include changes in business objectives or the economic environment. 

The NDA approval process 

In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that includes data to establish the safety and effectiveness of the new drug product for the proposed indication. The NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The NDA filing must also be accompanied by a substantial user fee, although there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. 

&#160;

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. If the FDA requests additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 

Once the NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth substantive review and sets a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two &#8209;tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within 10 to 12 months, whereas the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will review the proposed product labeling and may request changes. FDA will also inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will communicate the deficiencies to the applicant and often will request additional testing or information. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory standards for approval. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

The clinical testing and drug approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if the FDA approves a product, the agency may limit the approved indications for use, impose prominent warnings, or place other conditions on approval that could restrict the commercial application of the products, such as special risk management measures through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). 

Our iDose implant may be eligible for the Section 505(b)(2) application pathway if and when we are prepared to submit an application for marketing to the FDA. Section 505(b)(2) expressly permits the FDA to rely, in approving a new drug application, on data not developed by the applicant. Thus, if a 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on 

&#160;

the FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. We are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory strategy for our iDose implant, which we expect will allow us to rely in our NDA filing on certain nonclinical and clinical safety findings made by the FDA in previous approvals. For changes to a previously approved drug product, an application may rely on the FDA&#8217;s finding of safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug, coupled with the information needed to support the change from the approved drug product. The additional information could be new studies conducted by the applicant or published data. The FDA may approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 

The filing or approval of a Section 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. Section 505(b)(2) applications must include patent certifications and must provide notice of certain patent certifications to the NDA holder and patent owner. A Section 505(b)(2) application may be granted three years of market exclusivity if one or more of the clinical investigations, other than bioavailability/bioequivalence studies, was essential to approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. 

Circumstances could change that may cause a Section 505(b)(2) application for our product to no longer be an appropriate pathway. For example, if an equivalent drug product were approved before our application is submitted, the applicable pathway for our drug product might be an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA seeks approval of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so &#8209;called &#8220;reference listed drug&#8221; approved under an NDA with full supporting data to establish safety and effectiveness. Limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special petition process. An ANDA must contain certifications relating to patents for the reference listed drug. An ANDA also generally contains limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as the reference listed drug, which is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, and must contain certifications to patents listed with the FDA for the reference listed drug. 

Post &#8209;approval regulation 

After regulatory approval of a drug or combination drug/device product is obtained under an NDA, we are required to comply with pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post &#8209;marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, the holder of an approved NDA would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse events and production problems to the FDA, and to provide updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk &#8209;management mechanisms. For a combination drug/device product, such as our iDose implant, certain device reporting requirements might also apply, such as MDR requirements and reports of corrections and removal. 

Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. In addition, medical device quality system regulations would apply to the device component of a combination drug/device product, either all the QSR regulations or particular QSR regulations supplementing the drug cGMP in accordance with FDA regulations in 21 C.F.R. Part 4. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP and QSR. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third &#8209;party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP, QSR, and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

&#160;

After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, as well as some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 

Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA &#8209;initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post &#8209;approval clinical trials; 

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off &#8209;label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off &#8209;label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and/or could significantly impact the requirements imposed on us after approval. 

Available special regulatory procedures 

Formal meetings 

In the United States, there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 

Advice from the FDA is typically provided based on questions concerning quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), pre &#8209;clinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk &#8209; management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing application for the drug product. 

To obtain binding commitments from the FDA on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a new drug product, Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) procedures are available. Where the FDA agrees to an SPA, the agreement may not be changed by either the sponsor or the FDA except if the sponsor and the FDA agree to a change, or a senior FDA official determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is conducted according to the terms of an SPA. 

&#160;

Pediatric development 

In the United States, the FDCA provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for a drug if reports are filed of investigations studying the use of the drug product in a pediatric population in response to a written request from the FDA. 

In addition, NDAs must contain data (or a proposal for post &#8209;marketing activity) to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end &#8209;of &#8209;Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA. 

Priority review or standard review 

Based on results of Phase III clinical trials, an NDA may receive priority or standard review from the FDA. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Effective October 1, 2012, where an application receives priority review, the target date for FDA action will be eight months from submission in the case of an application for a new chemical entity and six months from submission in the case of products that do not contain a new chemical entity. Where an application receives standard review, the target date for FDA action will be 12 months from submission in the case of an application for a new chemical entity and 10 months from submission in the case of products that do not contain a new chemical entity. 

Other healthcare laws 

We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti &#8209;kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 

The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (FCA). Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors. Violations of the Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties. 

The FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off &#8209;label. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of device companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other improper sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi &#8209;million and multi &#8209;billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action 

&#160;

plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers&#8217; and manufacturers&#8217; compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. If our marketing, clinical trial recruitment, research or other arrangements, including consulting arrangements with physicians, were determined to violate anti &#8209;kickback or related laws, including the FCA, then our revenues could be adversely affected, which would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

In addition, there has been a trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013&#8212;December 31, 2013) by March 31, 2014, and were required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, device manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 

The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

Regulation outside the United States 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of a product under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the United States before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

In the European Economic Area (EEA) our iStent product is regulated as a medical device. Where a medical device is intended to administer a drug, the medical device will ordinarily be regulated as a medical device, while the medicinal product will be separately regulated as a medicinal product. However, when a drug &#8209;device combination product, such as iDose , is placed on the market as a single integral product that is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and that is not reusable, the entire product will be regulated as a medicinal product, although the device component will still need to comply with the so &#8209;called essential requirements applicable to medical devices. 

Regulation of medical devices in the EEA 

There is currently no premarket government review of medical devices in the EEA unless the device also contains a medicine or a blood derivative. However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive. The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards 

&#160;

applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement. 

To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Manufacturers usually have some flexibility to select conformity assessment procedures for a particular class of device and to reflect their circumstances, such as the likelihood that the manufacturer will make frequent modifications to its products. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post &#8209;market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low &#8209;risk medical devices, where the manufacturer can self &#8209;declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body would typically audit and examine products&#8217; technical dossiers and the manufacturers&#8217; quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device. 

In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive and applicable European and ISO standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report. 

In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medical devices that will, if adopted, replace the existing Medical Devices Directive. After protracted negotiations, the proposal has now entered a so &#8209;called trilogue procedure involving the European Parliament, Commission and Council, in which all parties will seek to agree to a compromise position. If adopted, the Regulation is expected to enter into force sometime in 2016 and become applicable three years thereafter. In its current form it would, among other things, impose additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high risk medical devices, impose an obligation on manufacturers to appoint a &#8220;qualified person&#8221; responsible for regulatory compliance, and provide for more strict clinical evidence requirements. 

Regulation of medicinal products in the EEA 

Medicinal Products require a marketing authorization before they may be placed on the market in the EEA. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of product involved. The centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EEA. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the European Medicines Agency (EMA)where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products that (1) are derived from specified biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005) indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, (3) are orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products). For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active substance (not yet approved on November 20, 2005), (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical 

&#160;

innovation, or (iii) if its authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health. For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing authorization in a single EEA member state; (2) the decentralized procedure, in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EEA member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EEA member state, and in which the EEA member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EEA member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health. A national procedure is only possible for one member state; as soon as an application is submitted in a second member state the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure will be triggered. 

Marketing authorization applications must usually include the results of clinical trials. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EEA must be conducted in accordance with EEA and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCP. Prior to commencing a clinical trial in a particular EEA member state, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. 

There is scope for applicants to omit some or all of the pre &#8209;clinical and clinical trial data if the product falls within the definition of a generic of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity protection has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two &#8209;year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. 

For generic applications, the marketing authorization underpinning the reference medicinal product must be based on a complete dossier; a generic application referring to a generic dossier is not possible. Generic applicants may need to submit additional pre &#8209;clinical or clinical data if their product does not fall within the definition of a generic ( i.e. , where there are differences in active substances, therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration, in relation to the reference medicinal product, or where bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through standard bioavailability studies). In these cases, bridging data is required to demonstrate that the differences do not affect the product&#8217;s relative safety and effectiveness inappropriately. 

Pre &#8209;clinical and clinical data can be omitted and replaced with references to scientific literature if the product has been in well &#8209;established medicinal use in the European Union for at least 10 years. An existing marketing authorization holder may also give consent for a subsequent applicant to reference the pharmaceutical, pre &#8209;clinical and clinical data on file for the original product. 

In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, e.g. , because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. 

Medicinal products may only be manufactured in the EEA, or imported into the EEA from another country, by the holder of a manufacturing authorization from the competent national authority. The product must have been manufactured in accordance with EU standards of GMP before it can be released onto the EEA market. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP. 

The holders of marketing authorizations in the EEA are subject to various post &#8209;approval controls and requirements. These include the establishment of a pharmacovigilance system and reporting of adverse reactions. The regulatory authorities may impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization, such as additional safety monitoring, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post &#8209;authorization safety studies. There are also specific rules governing advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including a requirement that all advertising and promotional activities for the product be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and a prohibition on direct &#8209;to &#8209;consumer advertising of prescription medicines.

Other 

Our operations and many of the products we manufacture or sell are subject to extensive regulation by numerous other governmental agencies, both within and outside the United States. In the United States, apart from the agencies discussed above, our facilities, operations, employees, products (their manufacture, sale, import and export) and services are regulated by Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Health &#38; Safety Administration, the Department of Labor, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and others. Furthermore, because we supply products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare, our activities are also subject to regulation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and enforcement by the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services. We are also required to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, among others. State agencies also regulate our facilities, operations, employees, products and services within their respective states. Government agencies outside the United States also regulate public health, product registration, manufacturing, environmental conditions, labor, exports, imports and other aspects of our global operations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 182 employees, with 95 in sales and marketing, 66 in research and development, clinical, regulatory and quality assurance, 11 in general and administrative, and 10 in manufacturing and distribution. We often supplement our research and development and clinical, regulatory and quality assurance departments with independent consultants on a project basis. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
