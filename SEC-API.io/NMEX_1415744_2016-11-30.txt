 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on December 11, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada. 

&#160; 

We were originally a company involved in the placing of strength testing amusement gaming machines called Boxers in venues such as bars, pubs and nightclubs in the Seattle area, in the State of Washington. We acquired one Boxer that had been placed in Lynnwood, Washington. However, the machine was de-commissioned as it needed material repairs. We were not able to secure sufficient capital for these repairs and our management decided to change our business focus to on oil and gas and mineral exploration. 

&#160; 

Current Business 

&#160; 

Coleman County, Texas &#8211; Three well rework/re-completion project 

&#160; 

On October 14, 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 75% working interest in the J.E. Richey lease. This lease area has six known productive formations. The existing three wells on the lease are fully equipped. Beginning in May 2015 we started conducting operations on the three wells to place them back into production. The rework/re-completion was completed on July 28, 2015 and production of oil and gas was established. For additional information on the Coleman County, Texas &#8211; Three well rework/re-completion project - See ITEM 2 PROPERTIES. 

&#160; 

Callahan County, Texas &#8211; Shallow Oil project 

&#160; 

On July 7, 2014, we acquired a 75% working interest in the Isenhower lease. The Isenhower lease has three fully equipped wells completed in the Cook Sandstone at approximately 500 feet. The lease also has one approved water injection well and eight potential undrilled locations. Our plan is to rework all three of the wells to place them back into production and drill new wells to fully develop the acreage. No work was conducted during the fiscal year. Terms are being negotiated for addition time to perform the terms of the agreement. As of the date of this report no definitive terms have been reached. For additional information on the Callahan County, Texas Shallow Oil Project - See ITEM 2 PROPERTIES. 

&#160; 

Callahan County, Texas &#8211; Mississippi Reef project 

&#160; 

On July 7, 2014, we acquired a 60% working interest in the J. Morgan lease. The J. Morgan lease is located in an area with multiple formations that are known to be oil and gas productive. No work was conducted during the fiscal year. Terms are being negotiated for addition time to perform the terms of the agreement. As of the date of this report no definitive terms have been reached. For additional information on the Callahan County, Texas &#8211; Mississippi Project - See ITEM 2 PROPERTIES. 

&#160; 

Jones County, Texas &#8211; Palo Pinto Reef project 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year the Company acquired the Olson lease covering 160 acres in Jones County, Texas. This lease is 1.5 miles from the Strand Palo Pinto Reef Field which was discovered in 1940 and has produced 1,700,000 barrels of oil from 8 wells or 212,500 barrels of oil per well. The structure map on the Palo Pinto shows a large buildup in the Palo Pinto Reef across the southern portion of the lease. The Guinn #1 Olson well is 90&#8217; high to a well 1000&#8217; to the southeast and 42&#8217; high to a well 1,150&#8217; to the northwest. The Guinn well had a show and a tremendous buildup in the Palo Pinto Reef. The structural buildup and reef buildup across the acreage and close similarities to the Strand Field make this a very good prospect. For additional information on the Jones County, Texas project - See ITEM 2 PROPERTIES. 

&#160; 

Winnemucca Mountain Property 

&#160; 

On September 14, 2012, our company entered into an option agreement (as amended and restated on November 15, 2012, February 1, 2013 and August 26, 2013) with AHL Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation, and Golden Sands Exploration Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, wherein we acquired an option to purchase a revised 80% interest in and to certain mining claims from AHL Holdings and Golden Sands, which claims form the Winnemucca Mountain Property in Humboldt County, Nevada. This Winnemucca Mountain property is currently comprised of 208 unpatented mining claims covering an area of approximately 3,800 acres. 

&#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The aggregate cash fee payable to exercise the option has been increased from $1,715,000 to $1,755,000 and the total number of common shares issuable to exercise the option has been increased from 100,000 to 2,100,000. Lastly, the amended and restated agreement provides that AHL Holdings may elect to receive shares of our common stock in lieu of any cash payments payable pursuant to the agreement at a 75% discount to the then current closing market price. 

&#160; 

Effective July 30, 2014, we entered into amended and restated option agreement with AHL Holdings and Golden Sands that materially modifies and replaces the terms of the original option agreement (as amended last on August 26, 2013). No work was conducted on the property during the current fiscal year. Subsequent to July 31, 2016 the Company was negotiating to amend its option agreement with AHL Holdings and Golden Sands. For additional information see ITEM 2 PROPERTIES. 

&#160; 

Mining Sector 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are a mineral resource exploration company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. The Empress Property and the Winnemucca Property are administered by the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) in Nevada. In general, the federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on Federal Lands, including the Empress Property and Winnemucca Property, are administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, such as those governing the purchase, transport or storage of explosives, and those governing mine safety and health, also apply. 

&#160; 

The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the project. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements, such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals. 

&#160; 

Mining activities at the Properties are also subject to various environmental laws, both federal and state, including but not limited to the federal National Environmental Policy Act , CERCLA (as defined below), the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act , the Clean Water Act , the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act , and certain Nevada state laws governing the discharge of pollutants and the use and discharge of water. Various permits from federal and state agencies are required under many of these laws. Local laws and ordinances may also apply to such activities as waste disposal, road use and noise levels. 

&#160; 

We are committed to fulfilling our requirements under applicable environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are continually changing and, as a general matter, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct our business in a manner that safeguards public health and mitigates the environmental effects of our business activities. To comply with these laws and regulations, we have made, and in the future may be required to make, capital and operating expenditures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 , as amended (CERCLA), imposes strict, joint, and several liability on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances. Liable parties include, among others, the current owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed or released into the environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time of such disposal or release. This liability could include response costs for removing or remediating the release and damages to natural resources. We are unaware of any reason why our properties would currently give rise to any potential liability under CERCLA. We cannot predict the likelihood of future liability under CERCLA with respect to our properties or surrounding areas that have been affected by historic mining operations. 

&#160; 

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and related state laws, mining companies may incur costs for generating, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous or solid wastes associated with certain mining-related activities. RCRA costs may also include corrective action or clean up costs. 

&#160; 

Mining operations may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants, from stationary equipment, such as crushers and storage facilities, and from mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment. All of these sources are subject to review, monitoring, permitting, and/or control requirements under the federal Clean Air Act and related state air quality laws. Air quality permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the permitting conditions. Under the federal Clean Water Act and delegated state water-quality programs, point-source discharges into &#8220;Waters of the State&#8221; are regulated by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of dredge and fill material into &#8220;Waters of the United States,&#8221; including wetlands. Stormwater discharges also are regulated and permitted under that statute. All of those programs may impose permitting and other requirements on our operations. 

&#160; 

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires an assessment of the environmental impacts of &#8220;major&#8221; federal actions. The &#8220;federal action&#8221; requirement can be satisfied if the project involves federal land or if the federal government provides financing or permitting approvals. NEPA does not establish any substantive standards. It merely requires the analysis of any potential impact. The scope of the assessment process depends on the size of the project. An &#8220;Environmental Assessment&#8221; (EA) may be adequate for smaller projects. An &#8220;Environmental Impact Statement&#8221; (EIS), which is much more detailed and broader in scope than an EA, is required for larger projects. NEPA compliance requirements for any of our proposed projects could result in additional costs or delays. 

&#160; 

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of the U.S. Department of Interior. The purpose of the ESA is to conserve and recover listed endangered and threatened species and their habitat. Under the ESA, &#8220;endangered&#8221; means that a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The term &#8220;threatened&#8221; under such statute means that a species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. Under the ESA, it is unlawful to &#8220;take&#8221; a listed species, which can include harassing or harming members of such species or significantly modifying their habitat. We currently are unaware of any endangered species issues at our projects that would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Future identification of endangered species or habitat in our project areas may delay or adversely affect our operations. 

&#160; 

U.S. federal and state reclamation requirements often mandate concurrent reclamation and require permitting in addition to the posting of reclamation bonds, letters of credit or other financial assurance sufficient to guarantee the cost of reclamation. If reclamation obligations are not met, the designated agency could draw on these bonds or letters of credit to fund expenditures for reclamation requirements. Reclamation requirements generally include stabilizing, contouring and re-vegetating disturbed lands, controlling drainage from portals and waste rock dumps, removing roads and structures, neutralizing or removing process solutions, monitoring groundwater at the mining site, and maintaining visual aesthetics. We are committed to maintaining all of our financial assurance and reclamation obligations. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are currently in compliance with the statutory and regulatory provisions governing our operations. We hold or will hold all necessary permits and other authorizations to the extent that our current or future claims and the associated operations require them. During the initial phases of our exploration program there will not be any significant disturbances to the land or environment and hence, no government approval is required. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

However, we may do business and own properties in a number of different geographical areas and are therefore subject to the jurisdictions of a large number of different authorities at different countries. We plan to comply with all statutory and regulatory provisions governing our current and future operations. However, these regulations may increase significant costs of compliance to us, and regulatory authorities also could impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how laws or regulations would impact our future business. We also can give no assurance that we will be able to comply with future changes in the statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

As we do not know the extent of the exploration program that we will be undertaking, we cannot estimate the cost of the remediation and reclamation that will be required. Hence, it is impossible at this time to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position in the event that a potentially economic deposit is discovered. 

&#160; 

If we are successful in identifying a commercially viable ore body and we are able to enter into commercial production, due to the increased environmental impact, the cost of complying with permit and environmental laws will be greater than in the previous phases. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements. 

&#160; 

While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

&#160; 

Oil &#38; Gas Sector 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The petroleum industry is highly competitive. Many of the oil and gas exploration companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of properties of merit and on exploration. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of resource properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration, and to senior exploration companies that may purchase resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further exploration. 

&#160; 

We compete with other exploration and early stage operating companies for financing from a limited number of investors prepared to make investments in junior companies exploring for conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources. The presence of competing oil and gas exploration companies, both major and independent, may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the properties under investigation, and the price of the investment offered to investors. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry. We have developed internal procedures and policies to ensure that our operations are conducted in full and substantial environmental regulatory compliance. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations. 

&#160; 

We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in the oil and natural gas industry. 

&#160; 

Pricing and Marketing of Natural Gas 

&#160; 

In the US, historically, the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC. In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, or the Decontrol Act. The Decontrol Act removed all NGA and NGPA price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993 and sales by producers of natural gas are uncontrolled and can be made at market prices. The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated and from time to time proposals are introduced by Congress and the FERC and judicial decisions are rendered that impact the conduct of business in the natural gas industry. We cannot assure you that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue. 

&#160; 

Pricing and Marketing of Oil 

&#160; 

In the US, sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Effective January 1,1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil that allowed for an increase in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser. 

&#160; 

Royalties and Incentives 

&#160; 

The royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. In the US, all royalties are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee. 

&#160; 

Environmental 

&#160; 

Like the oil and natural gas industry in general, our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect and preserve natural resources and the environment. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation in the oil and natural gas industry is generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue. These laws and regulations often require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; limit or prohibit access, especially in wilderness areas with endangered or threatened plant or animal species; impose restrictions on construction, drilling and other exploration and production activities; regulate air emissions, wastewater and other production and waste streams from our operations; impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations; and require the reclamation of certain lands. 

&#160; 

The permits required for many of our operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, compliance orders, and other enforcement actions. We are not aware of any material noncompliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements, however, given the complex regulatory requirements applicable to our operations, and the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws in our industry, we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters, and our future costs to achieve compliance, or remedy potential violations, could be significant. Our operations require permits and are regulated under environmental laws, and current or future noncompliance with such laws, as well as changes to existing laws or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Waste Disposal and Contamination Issues 

&#160; 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state laws may impose strict and joint and several liability on owners and operators of contaminated sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. Under these and other laws, the government, neighboring landowners and other third parties may recover the costs of responding to soil and groundwater contamination and threatened releases of hazardous substances, and seek recovery for related natural resources damages, personal injury and property damage. Some of our properties have been used for exploration and production activities for a number of years by third parties, and such properties could result in unknown cleanup liabilities for us. 

&#160; 

The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the &#34;RCRA&#34;) and comparable state statutes govern the management, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as &#34;non-hazardous&#34; (for example, the waters produced from hydraulic fracturing operations), such wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes in the future, thereby making them subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements which could have a material impact on us. 

&#160; 

Water Regulation 

&#160; 

The federal Clean Water Act (the &#34;CWA&#34;), the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the &#34;SWDA&#34;) and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants into surface waters or underground wells and the construction of facilities in wetland areas without a permit. Federal regulations also require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as us, to prepare and implement spill prevention, control countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. In addition, the Oil Pollution Act (the &#34;OPA &#34;) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. For onshore and offshore facilities that may affect waters of the United States, the OPA requires an operator to demonstrate financial responsibility. Regulations are currently being developed or considered under federal and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on us. 

&#160; 

These and similar state laws also govern the management and disposal of produced waters from the extraction process. Currently, wastewater associated with oil and natural gas production is prohibited from being directly discharged to waterways and other waters of the U.S. While some of the wastewater is reused or re-injected, a significant amount still requires proper disposal. As a result, some wastewater is transported to third-party treatment plants. In October 2011, citing concerns that third-party treatment plants may not be properly equipped to handle wastewater from shale gas operations, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#34;EPA&#34;) announced that it will consider federal pre-treatment standards for these wastewaters. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard, but future regulation of our produced waters or other waste streams could have a material impact on us. 

&#160; 

Air Emissions and Climate Change 

&#160; 

The federal Clean Air Act (&#34;CAA&#34;) imposes permit requirements and operational restrictions on certain sources of emissions used in our operations. In July 2011, the EPA published proposed New Source Performance Standards (&#34;NSPS&#34;) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (&#34;NESHAPs&#34;) that would, if adopted, amend existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and natural gas facilities and create new NSPS standards for oil and natural gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. Importantly, these standards would include standards for hydraulically fractured wells. The standards would apply to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. A court has directed the EPA to issue final rules by April 1, 2012. In a report issued in late 2011, the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee of the Department of Energy (the &#34;DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee&#34;) called on the EPA to complete the rulemaking quickly and recommended expanding the shale gas emission sources to be covered by the new rules. The DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee also encouraged states to take similar action, and included several other recommendations for studying and reducing air emissions from shale gas production activities. Because the EPA's regulations have not yet been finalized, we cannot at this time predict the impact they may have on our financial condition or results of operation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The issue of climate change has received increasing regulatory attention in recent years. The EPA has issued regulations governing carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gas (&#34;GHG&#34;) emissions citing its authority under the CAA Several of these regulations have been challenged in litigation that is currently pending before the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In December 2011, the EPA issued amendments to a final rule issued in 2010 requiring reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. Under this rule, we are obligated to report to the EPA certain GHG emissions from our operations. We do not expect that the costs of this new reporting will be material to us. In a late 2011 report, the DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee recommended that the EPA expand reporting requirements for GHG emissions from shale gas emission sources, and include methane in reporting requirements. More generally, several proposals to regulate GHG emissions have been proposed in the U.S. Congress, and various states have taken steps to regulate GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of regulations or legislation imposing restrictions or other regulatory obligations on emissions of GHGs from oil and natural gas operations could require us to obtain permits or allowances for our GHG emissions, install new pollution controls, increase our operational costs, limit our operations or adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our lands. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 

&#160; 

Our industry uses hydraulic fracturing to recover oil and natural gas in deep shale and other previously inaccessible subsurface geological formations. Hydraulic fracturing (or &#34;fracking&#34;) is a process to significantly increase production in drilled wells by creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in underground formations by injecting water, sand and other additives into formations at high pressures. Like others in our industry, we may use this process as a means to increase the productivity of our wells. Although hydraulic fracturing has been an accepted practice in the oil and natural gas industry for many years, its use has dramatically increased in the last decade, and concerns over its potential environmental effects have received increasing attention from regulators and the public. 

&#160; 

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (&#34;SDWA&#34;), the EPA is prohibited from regulating the injection of fracking fluids through its underground injection control program, except in limited circumstances (for example, the EPA has asserted that it has authority to regulate when diesel is a component of the fluids). Waters produced from fracking operations must be disposed of in accordance with federal and state regulations. As discussed above, the EPA has announced an intention to propose pre-treatment standards for produced waters that are to be disposed of at third-party wastewater treatment plants. Separately, the EPA is studying the effects of fracking on drinking water as a result of Congressional and public concern over fracking's potential to impact groundwater supplies, and the EPA has indicated that it expects to issue its findings later this year. 

&#160; 

In that regard, the EPA recently issued a study indicating that contamination may have resulted from certain fracking operations in Wyoming. The operator of the wells has challenged the EPA's findings, contending that other activities may be to blame for contaminated groundwater in the area, but the EPA's findings can be expected to draw increased attention to potential groundwater impacts from fracking. In late 2011, the DOE Shale Gas Subcommittee recommended further study and coordination of federal, state and local efforts to determine and monitor potential groundwater impacts from fracking activities. 

&#160; 

Other federal agencies, including the DOE, the Department of Interior, and the US Congress, are also investigating the potential impacts of fracking. In addition, bills have been introduced in the US. Congress to amend the SWDA to allow the EPA to regulate the injection of fracking fluids, which could require our and similar operations to meet federal permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction and testing specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management is developing draft regulations that would require companies drilling on federal land to disclose details of chemical additives, test the integrity of wells and report on water use and waste management. In November 2011, the EPA announced that it would solicit public input on possible reporting requirements for chemicals used in fracking under the authority of the federal Toxic Substances Control Act. 

&#160; 

States, which traditionally have been the primary regulators of exploration and production wells, are also considering or have recently adopted, or may in the future adopt, additional regulations governing fracking activities. For example, North Dakota recently adopted regulations, effective April 1, 2012, to require disclosure of the chemical components of hydraulic fracturing fluids. We believe that compliance with any new reporting requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us. Nonetheless, these disclosures could make it easier for third parties who oppose fracking to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that chemicals used in fracking could contaminate groundwater. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for fracking to cause earthquakes through the disposal of produced waters into Class II underground injection control (&#34;UIC&#34;). The EPA's current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. Some environmentalists have asked the EPA to consider reversing an exemption that excludes such wastewaters from hazardous waste rules, which would subject the wastes to more stringent management and disposal requirements. We cannot predict the EPA's future actions in this regard. Certain states, such as Ohio, where earthquakes have been alleged to be linked to fracking activities, have proposed regulations that would require mandatory reviews of seismic data and related testing and monitoring as part of the future permitting process for UIC wells. In addition, certain other states, including New York, New Jersey and Vermont have sought to place moratoria on fracking or subject it to more stringent permitting and well construction and testing requirements. Additionally, several cities in the State of Colorado voted in November 2013 to ban or restrict fracking activities within their city limits. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Expenditures 

&#160; 

We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the past two fiscal years. 

&#160;
