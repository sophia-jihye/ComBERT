 Item 1. Business 

Business Overview 

Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. is an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products in the property and casualty market. We target niches where we can develop a leadership position and where we believe we will generate superior underwriting profits. Our growth has been achieved both organically through an operating strategy focused on disciplined underwriting and as a result of strategic acquisitions. 

Following is a summary organizational chart for Argo Group: 

Business Segments and Products 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our operations included four ongoing business segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Commercial Specialty, International Specialty and Syndicate 1200. In addition to the four main business segments, we have a Run-off Lines segment for certain products we no longer underwrite. For discussion of the operating results of each business segment, please refer to Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Note 18, "Segment Information," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Excess and Surplus Lines 

The Excess and Surplus Lines segment focuses on U.S. based risks that the standard (admitted) market is unwilling or unable to underwrite. The standard market’s limited appetite for such coverage is often driven by the insured’s unique risk characteristics, the perils involved, the nature of the business, and/or the insured’s loss experience. This business is able to underwrite these risks with more flexible policy terms on an admitted and non-admitted basis. Non-admitted carriers, while approved, are not licensed in the states in which they underwrite and, therefore, are subject to less regulation. By contrast, admitted carriers are licensed by states and are subject to all of the regulations and requirements of those states. 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment consists of two operating platforms: Colony Specialty and Argo Pro. While focused primarily on non-admitted business, each of these operations may also underwrite certain classes of business on an admitted basis for risks that otherwise meet our underwriting standards. 

Colony Specialty underwrites primary and e xcess casualty, property and professional liability coverage for hard-to-place risks and/or distressed businesses that typically fall outside of the standard insurance market’s risk appetite. This business is underwritten through six business units: Casual ty, Transportation, Specialty Property, Contract, Environmental and Allied Medical. Through these units, Colony Specialty provides coverage to a broad group of commercial enterprises including contractors, manufacturers, distributors, property owners, reta ilers, restaurants, environmental consultants and contractors and smaller medical facilities within the social services, miscellaneous healthcare and long-term care segments. 

Argo Pro is our mid-market professional lines platform and provides a broad portfolio of errors and omissions and management liability products for our wholesale and retail distribution partners. Argo Pro offers customized coverage on a primary and excess basis for risks on both an admitted and non-admitted basis, targeting commercial and select financial institution risks in the middle market and upper middle market segments. Our underwriting focus provides risk management solutions for accountants, architects and engineers, commercial crime, directors and officers, employment practices, fiduciary, lawyers, miscellaneous professionals, technology, privacy and security. 

Commercial Specialty 

This segment provides property, casualty and surety coverages designed to meet the specialized insurance needs of U.S based businesses within certain well-defined markets. It targets business classes and industries with distinct risk profiles that can benefit from specially designed insurance programs, tailored loss control and expert claims handling. This segment serves its targeted niche markets with a narrowly focused underwriting profile and specialized knowledge of the businesses it serves. Our Commercial Specialty segment consists of the following risk-bearing business units: Argo Insurance, Rockwood Casualty Insurance Company ("Rockwood"), Commercial Programs, Argo Surety, Trident Public Risk Solutions ("Trident") and ARIS Title Insurance Corporation ("ARIS"). In addition, we operate a variety of non-risk-bearing agency and brokerage operations that generate fee income under the Alteris brand. Most of the Alteris businesses operate as managing general agents ("MGA"). MGAs usually have the authority to bind insurance contracts of companies with whom they have appointments. Alteris units have underwriting authority for third-party carriers, as well as for certain Argo Group companies. 

Argo Insurance offers insurance and risk management services to Grocery, Restaurants and other Specialty Retail industries. Argo Insurance provides property, liability, workers compensation, automobile and umbrella coverage throughout the United States. 

Rockwood is a specialty underwriter of workers compensation for the mining industry. It also underwrites coverage for small commercial businesses including retail operations, light manufacturing, services and restaurants. Approximately 52% of its premiums are written in Pennsylvania. Rockwood underwrites policies on both a large-deductible basis and on a guaranteed-cost basis for smaller commercial accounts. In addition, Rockwood provides general liability and commercial automobile packages, as well as coverage for pollution liability, umbrella liability and surety to support its core clients’ other mining and mining-related exposures. 

Argo Surety offers surety products to a diverse range of U.S. businesses operating in numerous industries. Argo Surety provides surety solutions to businesses that must satisfy various eligibility conditions in order to conduct commerce, such as licensure requirements required by government statute or regulation, counterparty conditions found in private or public construction projects or satisfactory performance of contracted services. Surety products are commonly grouped into two broad categories referred to as commercial bonds and contract bonds. Commercial bonds are generally required of businesses that guarantee their compliance with regulations and statutes, the payment and performance assurance for various forms of contractual obligations, or the completion of services. Contract bonds are typically third-party performance, payment or maintenance guarantees associated with construction projects. Argo Surety targets multiple industries including construction (general, trade and service contractors), manufacturing, transportation, energy (coal, oil and gas), waste management, industrial equipment, technology, retail, public utilities and healthcare. 

Trident provides primary insurance products and risk management solutions for public sector entities such as counties, municipalities, public schools and other local government units and special districts. Its product lines include general liability, automobile liability, automobile physical damage, property, inland marine, crime, public officials’ liability, educators’ legal liability, employment practices liability, law enforcement liability and workers compensation coverage.

Alteris is a full-service Managing General Agency that provides a broad spectrum of products and services to brokers and clients throughout the United States. Its capabilities include program modeling, underwriting administration, policy-system solutions, claim services, risk consultation, and reinsurance placement. Each of Alteris’ specialty practices are supported by an integrated team of underwriting, claims, risk control, actuarial, and administrative support professionals. Targeted industry segments include breweries, wineries, emergency service organizations, forest products, landscape &amp; arborist contractors and water-related entities.

International Specialty 

This segment includes business units that underwrite insurance and reinsurance risks worldwide through the broker market, specializing in specialty property catastrophe reinsurance and excess casualty and professional insurance. These businesses operate as Argo Re, the Casualty and Professional Lines unit of Argo Insurance in Bermuda, ArgoGlobal SE in Continental Europe and Argo Seguros Brazil, S.A. ("Argo Seguros") in Brazil. 

Argo Re underwrites short-tail reinsurance lines exposed to property catastrophe risks. Argo Re focuses on writing property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance for a relatively small number of cedents whose accounts are well known to our underwriters. Argo Re also underwrites property per risk and pro rata reinsurance on a select basis. Reinsurance written by Argo Re covers underlying exposures that are located throughout the world, including the United States. Property catastrophe reinsurance generally covers claims arising from large catastrophic events such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, industrial explosions, freezes, riots, floods and other man-made or natural disasters. In addition to its primary location in Bermuda, Argo Re originates business through other Argo Group affiliates worldwide. 

The Casualty and Professional Lines unit of our Argo Insurance division is managed from Bermuda. This unit serves the needs of global clients for coverage in the following lines: general and products liability, directors and officer’s liability, errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability. 

ArgoGlobal SE is based in Malta and underwrites professional liability business in Continental Europe.

Argo Seguros is our property and casualty insurance company based in Sao Paolo, Brazil, which is focused on serving the domestic commercial insurance market. Argo Seguros provides a broad range of commercial property, casualty and specialty coverages. Its primary lines of business are cargo and marine, property and engineering and financial lines. It also participates in Brazil’s federal Motor Third-Party Liability insurance pool. 

Syndicate 1200 

The Syndicate 1200 segment is focused on underwriting worldwide property, specialty and non-U.S. liability insurance through Argo Underwriting Managing Agency, Ltd. on behalf of Lloyd’s Syndicate 1200 within the Lloyd’s of London global franchise. The segment’s business platform is based in London, with offices in Shanghai, Singapore and Dubai. Syndicate 1200 obtains its underwriting capital from a variety of sources and seeks to maintain a balance between capital managed on our behalf and capital managed on behalf of third parties. The sources of the underwriting capital for Syndicate 1200 include our interest, third-party capital participants referred to as trade capital providers and third-party capital attributable to individual members referred to as Names. Trade capital providers participate on a quota share basis or directly through the syndicate. The flexibility in the sources of capital allows us to manage underwriting exposure over the insurance cycle. Our economic participation in the syndicate varies by year of account based on our risk appetite and the level of third-party participation. This segment earns a return on the underwriting capital that is provided by us and fee income earned from the management of third-party capital. 

The property division of the Syndicate 1200 segment concentrates mainly on North American commercial properties but is also active in the residential sector, including collateral protection insurance programs for lending institutions. A large portion of business is underwritten through the use of binding authorities. The segment’s liability division underwrites professional indemnity, general liability, medical malpractice, casualty and motor treaty and directors and officers insurance, with emphasis on Canada, Australia and the U.K. The marine and energy division underwrites cargo, upstream and downstream energy, yachts, hull and marine liability insurance. The aerospace division underwrites airline, general aviation, products and operators’ liability and satellite insurance. The specialty division underwrites personal accident, credit &amp; political risks, terrorism and contingency insurance. 

Lloyd’s currently operates in over 200 countries and territories, and we currently transact business in approximately 150 of these countries. Lloyd’s business is often written on a syndicated basis across the insurance market. Syndicate 1200 is the lead underwriter on approximately 36% of the business it underwrites. 

Run-off Lines 

Run-off Lines segment includes outstanding liabilities associated with discontinued lines previously underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries, such as those arising from liability policies dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s; risk management policies written by a business unit that has since been sold to a third party; and other legacy accounts previously written by our reinsurance subsidiaries. 

Marketing and Distribution 

We provide products and services to well-defined niche markets. We use our capital strength and the Argo Group brands to cross-market the products offered by each of our segments among our operating platforms and divisions. We offer our distribution partners tailored, innovative solutions for managing risk using the full range of products and services we have available. 

Excess and Surplus Lines 

Colony Specialty distributes its products through a network of appointed wholesale agents and brokers specializing in excess and surplus lines and certain targeted admitted lines. Approximately two-thirds of Colony Specialty’s premium volume in 2015 was produced by wholesale brokers who submit business and rely on Colony Specialty to produce quotes and handle policy issuance on such accounts. The remaining one-third of Colony Specialty’s premium was produced through a select group of wholesale agents to whom Colony Specialty has delegated limited authority to act on its behalf. These agents are granted authority to underwrite, quote, bind and issue policies in accordance with predetermined guidelines and procedures prescribed by Colony Specialty. Argo Pro distributes its products through both wholesale brokers and retail agents. 

Commercial Specialty 

Commercial Specialty uses a broad distribution platform to deliver specialty insurance products and services to our policyholders and agents. Argo Insurance products and services are distributed through selected independent agents, brokers, wholesalers and program managers with demonstrated expertise in one or more of its targeted niche markets. Rockwood distributes its product lines through a network of independent retail and wholesale agents. Trident provides its insurance products and related services through licensed retail agents, selected brokers and state program managers. Argo Surety distributes its products through selected surety specialty agents and brokers across the United States. ARIS employs both a direct and partner-distribution strategy, which includes brokers, insurers, market advisors, art lenders, investment funds and auction houses. Alteris generally distributes products underwritten on behalf of third-party carriers and Argo Group through retail agents and selected brokers. 

International Specialty 

Argo Re obtains substantially all of its reinsurance business through brokers and third-party intermediaries who represent clients in negotiations for the purchase of reinsurance. None of the intermediaries through which Argo Re obtains this business are authorized to bind business on our behalf. Argo Insurance distributes its products through selected brokers. ArgoGlobal SE distributes products through brokers in selected European markets. Argo Seguros distributes products through selected brokers and agents within the Brazilian markets. 

Syndicate 1200 

Syndicate 1200 obtains insurance and reinsurance business from two main sources: the Lloyd’s open market and underwriting agencies with delegated authority. In the Lloyd’s open market, brokers approach Syndicate 1200 directly with individual insurance risk opportunities for consideration by our underwriters. Brokers also approach Syndicate 1200 through selected underwriting agencies that are granted limited authority delegated by Syndicate 1200 to make underwriting decisions on individual risks. In general, risks written in the open market are larger than risks written on our behalf by authorized agencies in terms of both exposure and premium. 

Competition 

We compete in a wide variety of markets against numerous and varied competitors, depending on the nature of the risk and coverage being written. The competition for any one account may range from large international firms to smaller regional companies in the domiciles in which we operate. 

To remain competitive, our strategy includes, among other elements: (1) focusing on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline while providing a competitively priced product, (2) leveraging our distribution network by providing product solutions, (3) controlling expenses, (4) maintaining financial strength and issuer credit ratings, (5) providing quality services to agents and policyholders, including rate, quote, bind and issue (RQBI) technologies such as EDGE, Colony Rater and others to make it easy to write business, and (6) exploiting opportunities to acquire suitable books of business. 

Excess and Surplus Lines 

Competition within the excess and surplus lines marketplace comes from a wide range of carriers. In addition to mature companies that operate nationwide, there is competition from carriers formed in recent years. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment may also compete with national and regional carriers from the standard market willing to underwrite policies on selected accounts on an admitted basis. 

Commercial Specialty 

Due to the diverse nature of the products offered by the Commercial Specialty segment, competition comes from various sources, but largely from regional companies or regional subsidiaries of national carriers. National carriers tend to compete for larger accounts along all product lines. Competition for our public entity products is primarily from small to medium size commercial insurers as well as from state and regional governmental risk pools. 

International Specialty 

Argo Re competes with numerous reinsurance and insurance companies. These competitors include independent insurance and reinsurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, departments of certain commercial insurance companies and underwriting syndicates. Argo Insurance and Argo Seguros compete with international, national and regional insurance companies that offer similar specialty lines of business. 

Syndicate 1200 

The principal lines of business in this segment are written by numerous other insurance companies and syndicates at Lloyd’s. Competition for any one account may come from other Lloyd’s syndicates, international firms or smaller regional companies. 

Ratings 

Ratings are an important factor in assessing our competitive position and our ability to meet our ongoing obligations. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Moreover, the ratings of each rating agency should be evaluated independently as the rating methodology and evaluation process may differ. The ratings issued on us or our subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on our website and the respective rating agency’s websites. We have two types of ratings: (i) Financial Strength Ratings ("FSR") and (ii) Debt Ratings or Issuer Credit Ratings ("ICR"). 

Financial Strength Ratings reflect the rating agency’s assessment of an insurer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders. With the exception of Argo Seguros (which is not rated), all of our insurance and reinsurance companies have an FSR of "A" (Excellent) from A.M. Best Company ("A.M. Best"), and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have an FSR of "A-" (Strong) from Standard &amp; Poor’s ("S&amp;P"), with stable outlook.

Debt Ratings and Issuer Credit Ratings reflect the rating agency’s assessment of a company’s prospects for repaying its debts and can be considered by lenders in connection with the setting of interest rates and terms for a company’s short-term or long-term borrowings. Argo Group US, Inc. has an ICR and senior unsecured debt rating of "BBB-" from S&amp;P. Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. has an ICR and senior unsecured Debt Rating of "bbb" from A.M. Best. Except for ARIS Title and Argo Seguros, all of our insurance and reinsurance companies have an ICR of "a" from A.M. Best. 

A.M. Best Financial Strength Ratings range from "A++" (Superior) to "S" (Suspended) and include 16 separate ratings categories. S&amp;P Financial Strength Ratings range from "AAA" (Extremely Strong) to "R" (under regulatory supervision) and include 21 separate ratings categories. 

Syndicate 1200, our Lloyd’s syndicate, receives the Lloyd’s market FSR rating of "A" (Excellent) with a positive outlook by A.M. Best and "A+" (Strong) with a stable outlook by S&amp;P. 

Regulation 

General 

The business of insurance and reinsurance and related services is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation varies from one jurisdiction to another. The principal jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance segments operate are Bermuda, the United States, the European Union ("EU"), the United Kingdom, Brazil and Dubai. We are also regulated by other countries where we do business. 

Bermuda 

Insurance Company and Insurance Group Supervision and Regulation Scheme 

Many of Bermuda’s insurance groups subject to supervision are internationally active. Therefore, Bermuda’s group supervision framework reflects international developments in this area and principles for insurance group supervision adopted by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS"). 

Based on the Insurance Act 1978 ("the Act"), as amended from time to time, Bermuda maintains a progressive, risk-based supervisory system for registered (Re)Insurance Companies and for selected (Re)Insurance Groups. 

A number of Bermuda registered (re)insurers operate within a group structure, meaning that a local insurer’s financial position and risk profile, and its overall prudential position, may be impacted by being part of a group, both positively and negatively. Therefore, the Bermuda Monetary Authority ("BMA") has established a group supervision framework for insurance groups. The BMA conducts its responsibilities and powers as Group Supervisor under the Act, and the supporting legislation, the Insurance (Group Supervision) Rules 2011 and the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Insurance Groups Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011. 

The main objectives of group supervision include (a) policyholder protection, (b) ensuring at least one supervisor has an overall view of the group and its associated risks and (c) addressing any supervisory gaps, the risk of contagion and the impact of any unregulated entities within a group. Therefore, key areas of focus within the group supervision framework are (1) ensuring solvency at group level, (2) monitoring inter-group transactions and (3) assessing corporate governance, risk management and internal control processes of insurance groups. In conducting its function as Group Supervisor, the BMA, among other things, convenes and conducts supervisory colleges with other supervisory authorities that have regulatory oversight of entities within a group and coordinates the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information from groups for going concern or emergency situations. 

In May 2011, the BMA gave notice that it had determined itself to be the proper group supervisor for us for purposes of its Group Supervision regime, and nominated Argo Re to serve as the designated insurer. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries are deemed to be an affiliated group supervised by the BMA under applicable rules and regulations in Bermuda. 

In 2015, we were notified that the BMA met with the Insurance Departments of the States of Illinois and Virginia in a single supervisory college session related to us. The outcomes of the meeting were shared with us. We were notified that starting in 2016, Argo management will be invited to attend future supervisory college meetings.

The BMA is also responsible for the supervision, regulation and inspection of Bermuda domiciled insurance companies and for the licensing of all insurance companies, brokers, agents and managers doing business in Bermuda. The Act and its supporting legislation, the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and 3B Solvency Requirement), the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules, as well as various other policies and guidance notes, including the Insurance Code of Conduct, provide the BMA with substantive licensing and intervention powers. 

These rules provide for significant reporting requirements related to us and our consolidated financial condition. 

Solvency Regulation Scheme 

Bermuda continues to enhance its risk-based regulatory regime, to meet or exceed international standards, including Solvency II ("S II") as enacted by the EU in November 2009. In late November of 2015 a delegated act was adopted by the European Commission recommending full equivalence for Bermuda. That recommendation is now waiting for objection/adoption by the full European Parliament and Council. In that delegated act the European Commission announced its approval of Bermuda’s commercial (re)insurance regime as being fully equivalent to the regulatory standards applied under Solvency II. The BMA expects official confirmation of full Solvency II equivalence to be granted in the coming months with retroactive application to January 1 st 2016.

Many of the areas covered under this initiative have been phased in over recent years. The BMA has enhanced its existing regime consisting of three core comp onents: (1) Capital Adequacy, (2) Governance and Risk Management and (3) Disclosure and Reporting. Most of these elements are interconnected and potentially influenced by developments in other international regimes. (Re)insurance companies as well as (re)i nsurance groups are also subject to the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement ("BSCR"), a risk-based capital system mandated by the above mentioned rules. 

Regulation of Argo Re 

Classification of Insurers 

The Insurance Act distinguishes between special purpose insurers, insurers carrying on long-term business and insurers carrying on general business. There are various classifications of insurers carrying on general business, with Class 4 insurers subject to the highest level of regulation. Argo Re, which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business, is registered as a Class 4 insurer in Bermuda and is regulated as such under the Act. Under the Insurance Act, no distinction is made between insurance and reinsurance business. 

Principal Representative and Principal Office 

As an insurer, Argo Re is required to maintain a principal office and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. The principal representative is required to give notice to the BMA regarding certain events relating to solvency, significant losses, proposed changes in ownership and other material changes defined in the Insurance Act. In some instances, prior approval may be required for a proposed action that is the subject of a notice. 

Controlling Shareholders of an Insurer; Effect on Ownership of Shares in the Company 

The definition of a "shareholder controller" is set out in the Insurance Act, but generally refers to a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company. More stringent requirements apply at certain thresholds to those holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more. The BMA also has the power under the Insurance Act, at any time, by written notice, to object to any "controller" (including a shareholder controller) if it appears to the BMA that such person is not a fit and proper person to be such a controller. The BMA may require a shareholder controller to reduce its holding of our common shares and direct, among other things, that voting rights attaching to the common shares shall not be exercisable. 

Dividends 

Any dividend payments paid to Argo Re become part of the capital and surplus of Argo Re, at which point further upward distribution to Argo Group is subject to Bermuda insurance and solvency regulations as discussed above. 

In December of 2015, 2014 and 2013, Argo Re paid a cash dividend to Argo Group of $41.0 million, $40.9 million and $84.5 million, respectively. The proceeds of the dividends were used to repay intercompany balances related primarily to dividend and interest payments and other corporate expenses.

United States 

State Insurance Regulation 

Argo Group US, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of the states in which they are domiciled. We currently have twelve insurance companies domiciled in five states (the "U.S. Subsidiaries"). Argo Group US, Inc., as the indirect parent of the U.S. Subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. These laws generally require each of the U.S. Subsidiaries to submit annual holding company registration statements to its respective domestic state insurance department and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company group, including the filing of an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report with the Illinois Director of Insurance, as the lead state regulator. In order to assess the business strategy, financial position, legal and regulatory position, risk exposure, risk management, and governance processes, the Illinois Director of Insurance may participate in a supervisory college with other regulators charged with supervision of an Illinois domestic insurer or its affiliates, including other state, federal, and international regulatory agencie s . Generally, all material transactions among companies in the holding company group to which any of the U.S. Subsidiaries is a party, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements, must be fair and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the insurance department where the subsidiary is domiciled. Transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the holding company group may be subject to prior notice to, or prior 

appr oval by, state regulatory authorities. Such supervision and regulation is intended to protect our policyholders rather than our shareholders. Matters relating to authorized lines of business, underwriting standards, financial condition standards, licensing of insurers, investment standards, premium levels, policy provisions, the filing of annual and other financial reports prepared on the basis of Statutory Accounting Principles, the filing and form of actuarial reports, dividends and a variety of other fin ancial and non-financial matters are also areas that are regulated and supervised by the state in which each of our U.S. Subsidiaries are domiciled. 

Guaranty Associations 

Our U.S. Subsidiaries are participants in the statutorily created insolvency guaranty associations in all states where they are licensed carriers. These associations were formed for the purpose of paying unearned premium and loss claims of licensed insolvent insurance companies. The U.S. Subsidiaries are assessed their pro rata share of such claims based upon their written premiums, subject to a maximum annual assessment per line of insurance. Such costs can generally be recovered through surcharges on future premiums. Non-admitted business is neither supported by nor subject to guaranty assessments. 

Dividends 

All of the U.S. Subsidiaries are subsidiaries of Argo Group US, Inc., meaning that any dividends from the U.S. Subsidiaries are payable in the first instance to Argo Group US, Inc. prior to being passed upward as dividends to Argo Group. The ability of our U.S. Subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the jurisdictions of domicile that regulate our U.S. Subsidiaries and each such jurisdiction’s limitations upon the amount of dividends that an insurance company may pay without the approval of its insurance regulator. 

In December 2015, Argo Group US paid a $50.0 million dividend to its immediate parent, Argo Financial Holding.

Argo Group US, Inc. may receive dividends from its direct subsidiaries: Argonaut Insurance Company, Colony Insurance Company ("Colony") and Rockwood. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no dividends were declared by Argo Group US, Inc. direct subsidiaries. During 2016, Argonaut Insurance Company may be permitted to pay dividends up to $41.6 million without approval from the Illinois Division of Insurance, based on the application of the Illinois ordinary dividend calculation. Colony may be permitted, during 2016, to pay dividends up to $35.0 million without prior approval from the Virginia Bureau of Insurance, based on the application of Virginia’s ordinary dividend calculation. Rockwood may be permitted, during 2016, to pay dividends up to $18.2 million without approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, based on the application of Pennsylvania’s ordinary dividend calculation. Business and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid, and prior approval of extraordinary dividend payments is required. 

State laws require prior notice or regulatory approval of direct or indirect changes in control of an insurer, reinsurer or its holding company, and certain significant inter-corporate transfers of assets within the holding company structure. An investor who acquires or attempts to acquire shares representing or convertible into more than 10% of the voting power of the securities of Argo Group would become subject to at least some of such regulations, would require approval by the five domiciliary regulators of the U.S. subsidiaries prior to acquiring such shares and would be required to file certain notices and reports with the five domiciliary regulators prior to such acquisition. 

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 

On November 26, 2002, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 ("TRIA"). On January 12, 2015, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014 ("TRIPRA"), which extends TRIA through December 31, 2020. Under TRIA commercial insurers are required to offer insurance coverage against terrorist incidents and are reimbursed by the federal government for paid claims subject to deductible and retention amounts. TRIA, and its related rules, contain certain definitions, requirements and procedures for insurers filing claims with the Treasury for payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program ("TRIP"). TRIP is a temporary federal program that has been extended by TRIA to provide for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The Treasury implements the program. On June 29, 2004, the Treasury issued a final Claims Procedures Rule, effective July 31, 2004, as part of its implementation of Title I of TRIA. TRIA also contains specific provisions designed to manage litigation arising out of, or resulting from, a certified act of terrorism, and on July 28, 2004, the Treasury issued a final Litigation Management Rule for TRIA. The Claims Procedures Rule specifically addresses requirements for Federal payment, submission of an initial notice of insured loss, loss certifications, timing and process for payment, associated recordkeeping requirements, as well as the Treasury’s audit and investigation authority. These procedures will apply to all insurers that wish to receive their payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses under TRIA. 

Additional materials addressing TRIA and TRIP, including Treasury issued interpretive letters, are contained on the Treasury’s website. 

European Union (EU) 

The S II regulatory regime in the EU, imposes new solvency and governance requirements across all 27 EU Member States. The application date of the S II regime is January 1, 2016. 

S II, which manifests a significant enhancement of the existing Solvency I framework, is the expanded regulatory regime that will impose economic risk-based solvency requirements across all 27 European Member States and consists of three pillars: (1) Pillar I — quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; (2) Pillar II — qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process; and (3) Pillar III — market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurer's financial condition to regulators.

Our Lloyd’s Managing Agency, Argo Managing Agency Limited, which manages Syndicate 1200 at Lloyd’s, and ArgoGlobal SE (Malta) will be required to comply with S II. 

United Kingdom 

The Financial Services Act 

The Financial Services Bill, which received Royal Assent on December 19, 2012, has now become an Act of Parliament and is known as the Financial Services Act (2012). The Act, which came into force from April 1, 2013, provides regulators with comprehensive powers to counter future risks to financial stability and to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. 

The legislation reformed the regulatory system, which previously divided responsibility for financial stability between the Treasury, Bank of England and Financial Services Authority ("FSA"). The new system gives the Bank of England macro-prudential responsibility for oversight of the financial system and, through the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), for day-to-day prudential supervision of financial services firms managing significant balance-sheet risk. The Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") has been created to protect consumers, promote competition and ensure integrity in markets. 

PRA and FCA Regulations 

During 2015, the operations of Syndicate 1200 were regulated by the PRA and the FCA, as well as being supervised by Lloyd’s. The PRA, FCA and Lloyd’s have common objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd’s market is appropriately regulated. To minimize duplication, there are arrangements with Lloyd’s for co-operation on supervision and enforcement. Both the PRA and FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to the Lloyd’s Managing Agents (such as Argo Managing Agency Limited) that they regulate, including the power to remove their authorization to manage Lloyd’s Syndicates. In addition, each year the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency test that measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require Lloyd’s to cease trading and/or its members to cease or reduce underwriting. 

Lloyd’s Regulations and Requirements 

The operations of Syndicate 1200 are supervised by Lloyd’s. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the Lloyd’s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all Syndicates, including reviewing and approving the Syndicates’ annual business plans. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board requires annual approval of Syndicate 1200’s business plan, including maximum underwriting capacity, and may require changes to any business plan presented to it or that additional capital be provided to support underwriting. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members. 

The Argo Group predominantly participates in the Lloyd’s Market as a Lloyd’s corporate member on Syndicate 1200 through Argo (No 604) Ltd, a Lloyd’s corporate member. By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, Argo (No 604) Ltd undertakes to comply with all Lloyd’s by-laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 that are applicable to it. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as "Funds at Lloyd’s") in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined by Lloyd’s. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. These requirements allow Lloyd’s to evaluate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. 

If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its claims to policyholders, such claims may be payable by the Lloyd’s Central Fund. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution. 

Argo Managing Agency Limited owns three service companies, which produce business to Syndicate 1200 under delegated underwr iting authority arrangements. They are: 

- 

ArgoGlobal (Dubai) Limited 

ArgoGlobal (Dubai) Ltd. is authorized as an "Authorized Firm" licensed to operate through Dubai International Financial Centre ("DIFC") as an insurance manager and insurance intermediary by the Dubai Financial Services Authority ("DFSA"). Although not subject to solvency requirements and other regulations that apply to insurance carriers and reinsurers generally in Dubai, ArgoGlobal (Dubai) Ltd. is subject to DFSA’s laws and regulations relating to its business activities as an Authorized Firm (Category 4) operating in Dubai. The Company operates from the Lloyd’s Dubai platform, which gives Lloyd’s an underwriting base in the MENA region. ArgoGlobal (Dubai) Limited therefore receives regulatory oversight from both Lloyd’s and the DFSA.

ArgoGlobal Underwriting Asia Pacific Pte Limited 

ArgoGlobal Underwriting Asia Pacific Pte Limited is authorized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as a Lloyd’s Asia Scheme Service Company. The Company operates from the Lloyd’s Singapore platform, which provides Lloyd’s with an insurance and reinsurance hub in Singapore writing business from across the region. The Company therefore receives regulatory oversight from both Lloyd’s and the MAS.

- 

Argo Direct Limited 

Argo Direct Limited (ADL) is Authorised and Regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. ADL has been given permission to provide regulated products and services to commercial and retail customers. The Company therefore receives regulatory oversight from both Lloyd’s and the FCA.

Dividend payments from Argo Managing Agency Limited to its immediate parent are not restricted by regulatory authority. Dividend payments from Argo Managing Agency Limited will be at the discretion of Argo Managing Agency Limited’s Board of Directors and will be subject to the earnings, operations, financial condition, capital and general business requirements of Syndicate 1200. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided it has sufficient capital available.

Malta 

ArgoGlobal SE operates as a licensed insurer domiciled in Malta under the Malta Business Act (Cap. 403) by the Malta Financial Services Authority ("MFSA"). ArgoGlobal SE is regulated as a domestic insurer by the MFSA and subject generally to Malta’s laws and regulations relating to insurance and solvency requirements. ArgoGlobal SE entertains risks throughout the European Member States and European Economic Area, on an "Exercise of Passport Rights-Services/Establishment" basis. The authorized branch office in Zurich can only entertain Swiss domiciled risks. When payable, dividends from ArgoGlobal SE will be subject to applicable laws and regulations in Malta. 

Brazil 

Argo Seguros is authorized to operate as a licensed insurer domiciled in Brazil by the Superintend &#7879; ncia de Seguros Privados, ("SUSEP") per Ordinance n&#186; 4.316 issued in 2011. Argo Seguros is regulated as a domestic insurer by SUSEP and subject to Brazil’s laws and regulations relating to insurance and solvency requirements. When payable, dividends from Argo Seguros will be subject to applicable laws and regulations in Brazil. 

In April 2014, Argo Re Ltd. was registered by the SUSEP as an admitted reinsurer in Brazil, and established its representative office, Argo Re Escrit&#243;rio de Representa&#231;&#227;o no Brasil Ltda. ("Argo Re Escrit&#243;rio") in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, per Ordinance n&#186; 5.795. Argo Re Escritorio is focused on serving the domestic commercial reinsurance market. Argo Re Ltd. and Argo Re Escrit&#243;rio are subject to Brazil’s laws and regulations relating to business activities as an admitted reinsurer.

Reinsurance 

As is common practice within the insurance industry, Argo Group’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries transfer a portion of the risks insured under their policies by entering into a reinsurance treaty with another insurance or reinsurance company. Purchasing reinsurance protects primary carriers against the frequency and/or severity of losses incurred on the policies they issue, such as in the case of an unusually large individual claim or serious occurrences in which a number of claims on one policy aggregate to produce an extraordinary loss or where a catastrophe generates a large number of serious claims on multiple policies at the same time. Reinsurance does not discharge the issuing primary carrier from its obligation to pay a policyholder for losses insured under its policy. 

Rather, the reinsured portion of each loss covered under a reinsurance treaty is ceded to the assu ming reinsurer for reimbursement to the primary carrier. Because this creates a receivable owed by the reinsurer to the primary carrier, there is credit exposure with respect to losses ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet t he obligations assumed under its reinsurance treaty. The ability to collect on reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. We are selective in regard to our reinsurers, seeking out those with strong financial strength ratings from A.M. Best or S&amp;P. However, the financial condition of a reinsurer may change over time based on market conditions. We perform credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other things, financial condition , stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business. In certain instances, we also require deposit of assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from certain reinsurers whose financial strength rati ngs fall below a certain level, or who transact business on a non-admitted basis in the case of the U.S. subsidiaries in the state where the reinsured subsidiary is domiciled, or who provide reinsurance only on a collateralized basis. 

At December 31, 2015, Argo Group’s reinsurance recoverable balance totaled $1,121.1 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.2 million. The following table reflects the credit ratings for our reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2015:

Nine of the top ten reinsurers, rated A or higher, accounted for $668.3 million, or approximately 60% of the reinsurance recoverable balance as of December 31, 2015. Management has concluded that all balances (net of any allowances for doubtful accounts) are considered recoverable as of December 31, 2015. 

Additional information relating to our reinsurance activities is included under Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 3, "Reinsurance" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Argo Group records reserves for specific claims incurred and reported, as well as reserves for claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). The estimates of losses for reported claims are established judgmentally on an individual case basis. Such estimates are based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each individual claim. Reserves for reported claims consider our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle the claims, including investigation and defense of the claim, and may be adjusted for differences between costs originally estimated and costs re-estimated or incurred. 

Reserves for IBNR claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including the effects of inflation and other social and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other factors that would modify past experience. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs, including frequency and severity data and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available. Adjustments to previously estimated reserves are reflected in results in the year in which they are made. 

The estimate of reinsurance recoverables related to reported and unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the portion of the gross liabilities that are anticipated to be recovered from reinsurers. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are recognized as assets at the same time as, and in a manner consistent with, the gross losses associated with the reinsurance treaty. 

We are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, severe winter weather, fires and man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and cannot be reserved for in advance. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. 

We have discontinued underwriting certain lines of business; however, we are still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines. Certain lines currently in run-off are characterized by long elapsed periods between the occurrence of a claim and any ultimate payment to resolve the claim. Included in Run-off Lines segment are claims related to asbestos and environmental liabilities arising out of liability policies primarily written in the 1960s, 1970s and into the mid-1980s with a limited number of claims occurring on 

policies written in the early 1990s. Business formerly written in our Risk Management segment is also classified in the Run-off Lines segme nt. Additional discussion on the Run-off Lines segment can be found under Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". 

The tables below present a development of loss and loss adjustment expense ("LAE") reserve liabilities and payments for the years 2005 through 2015. The information presented in Table I is net of the effects of reinsurance. The information presented in Table II includes only amounts related to direct and assumed insurance. Amounts for the predecessor Bermuda reinsurance companies are not included for the years prior to 2007, the year of acquisition. Additionally, amounts for the Syndicate 1200 segment are not included for the years prior to 2008, the year of acquisition.

Excluded from the preceding tables are loss reserves of $135.7 million, which were classified as "Liabilities held for sale" as of December 31, 2007. 

On December 31, 2012, the Syndicate 1200 segment entered into a whole account quota share contract covering the 2009 and prior years of account. The counterparty was another syndicate within Lloyd’s. As a result of this transaction, net reserves for losses and LAE at the end of 2012 were reduced by $192.2 million ceded under this quota share agreement. On December 17, 2013, the Prudential Regulatory Authority approved a Split Reinsurance to Close arrangement whereby the liabilities assumed by the whole account quota share provider could be legally transferred to that quota share provider. On January 18, 2014, this transaction was effected with an inception date of January 1, 2014. 

In evaluating the information shown in the above tables certain matters should be taken into account. It should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. In addition, the tables present calendar year data, not accident or policy year development data. The social, economic and legal conditions and other trends which have had an impact on the changes 

in the estimated liability in the past are not necessarily indicative of the future. Accordingly, readers shoul d consider these factors when extrapolating any conclusions about future results from the information presented in these tables. 

Additional information relating to our loss reserve development is included under Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 5, "Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Investments 

Investment Strategy and Guidelines 

Our investment portfolio is designed to ensure adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of our obligations, including any potential claims payments. To ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims, we broadly seek to match the profile of our invested assets with those of our liabilities. We consider liquidity, anticipated duration, and the currency of our liabilities when making investment decisions. To meet our liquidity needs, our core bond portfolio consists primarily of investment grade, fixed-maturity securities. As of December 31, 2015, fixed maturities, along with cash and short-term investments, represented 76.9% of our total investments and cash equivalents. 

In an effort to meet business needs and mitigate risks, our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio’s composition, including issuer limits, sector limits, credit quality limits, portfolio duration, limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types. Our investment managers may invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than the U.S. dollar based on where our business is underwritten, the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated, regulatory requirements, or our managers’ point of view on a given currency. 

The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations, liquidity risk and credit and default risk. Investment guideline restrictions have been established in an effort to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control. A significant change in interest rates could result in losses, realized or unrealized, in the value of our investment portfolio. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to prepayment and possibly reinvestment risk. Certain investments in our Capital Appreciation Portfolio, which includes high yield fixed maturity securities, emerging market debt securities, domestic and global equities and other alternative investments are subject to restrictions on sale, transfer and redemption, which may limit our ability to withdraw funds or realize gains on such investments for some period of time after our initial investment. The values of, and returns on, such investments may also be more volatile. 

Investment Committee and Investment Managers 

The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors has approved an investment policy statement that contains investment guidelines and supervises our investment activity. The Investment Committee regularly monitors our overall investment results, compliance with investment objectives and guidelines and ultimately reports our overall investment results to the Board of Directors. 

We currently use multiple professional investment managers to manage our portfolio. A small portion of the investment portfolio is managed internally. 

Additional information relating to our investment portfolio is included under Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk", and Note 2, "Investments", in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,313 employees.
