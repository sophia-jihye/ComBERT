Acquisitions and Other Significant Events 

Fiscal 2016 

On June 30, 2016, the Company closed on a Stock Purchase Agreement (&#147;Jayco SPA&#148;) for the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of towable and motorized recreational vehicle manufacturer Jayco, Corp. (&#147;Jayco&#148;) for initial cash consideration of $576,060, subject to adjustment. This acquisition was funded from the Company&#146;s cash on hand and $360,000 from an asset-based revolving credit facility as more fully described in Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Jayco will operate as an independent operation in the same manner as the Company&#146;s other recreational vehicle subsidiaries. The Company purchased Jayco to complement its existing towable and motorized RV product offerings and dealer base. Due to the timing of this acquisition, the fiscal 2016 results included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income only include one month of Jayco&#146;s operating results. 

Fiscal 2015 

On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into a repurchase agreement (the &#147;May 15, 2015 Repurchase Agreement&#148;), to purchase shares of its common stock from the Thompson Family Foundation (the &#147;Foundation&#148;) in a private transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the May 15, 2015 Repurchase Agreement, the Company purchased from the Foundation 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $60.00 per share, and held them as treasury stock, representing an aggregate purchase price of $60,000. The closing price of Thor common stock on May 15, 2015 was $61.29. The transaction was consummated on May 19, 2015, and the Company used available cash to purchase the shares. The number of shares repurchased by the Company represented 1.9% of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding common stock immediately prior to the repurchase. 

On May 1, 2015, the Company closed on a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Postle Aluminum Company, LLC for the acquisition of all the outstanding membership units of Postle Operating, LLC (&#147;Postle&#148;) for cash consideration paid in fiscal 2015 of $144,048, net of cash acquired. Postle is a manufacturer of aluminum extrusion and specialized component products for the RV and other markets, and operates as an independent operation in the same manner as the Company&#146;s other subsidiaries. 

On January 5, 2015, the Company closed on a Stock Purchase Agreement (&#147;CRV/DRV SPA&#148;) for the acquisition of all the outstanding membership units of towable recreational vehicle manufacturer Cruiser RV, LLC (&#147;CRV&#148;) and luxury fifth wheel towable recreational vehicle manufacturer DRV, LLC (&#147;DRV&#148;) by its Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC subsidiary (&#147;Heartland&#148;). In accordance with the CRV/DRV SPA, the closing was deemed effective as of January 1, 2015. As contemplated in the CRV/DRV SPA, the Company also acquired, in a series of integrated transactions, certain real estate used in the ongoing operations of CRV and DRV. Cash consideration paid for this acquisition was $47,523, net of cash acquired. The Company purchased CRV and DRV to supplement and expand its existing lightweight travel trailer and luxury fifth wheel product offerings and dealer base. 

&#160; 

Fiscal 2014 

On May 1, 2014, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of towable recreational vehicle manufacturer KZ for initial cash consideration paid in fiscal 2014 of $52,409, net of cash acquired, and a working capital adjustment of $2,915 paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, resulting in total net cash consideration of $55,324. The Company purchased KZ to supplement its existing towable RV product offerings and dealer base. 

On October 31, 2013, the Company acquired the assets of towable recreational vehicle manufacturer Bison Coach, LLC, located in Milford, Indiana, for final cash consideration of $16,914. As a result of the purchase, the Company formed a new entity, Bison. The Company purchased the net assets of Bison to supplement its existing product offerings with Bison&#146;s equestrian products with living quarters. 

On August 30, 2013, the Company acquired the assets of towable recreational vehicle manufacturer Livin&#146; Lite Corp., through a wholly-owned subsidiary for final cash consideration of $16,769, net of cash acquired. As a result of the purchase, the Company formed a new entity, Livin&#146; Lite. The Company purchased the assets of Livin&#146; Lite to complement its existing brands with Livin&#146; Lite&#146;s advanced lightweight product offerings. 

Discontinued Operations (Fiscal 2014) 

On July 31, 2013, we entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement and sold our bus business to Allied Specialty Vehicles, Inc. (&#147;ASV&#148;) for final cash consideration of $105,043. The sale closed on October 20, 2013. Thor&#146;s bus business included Champion Bus, Inc., General Coach America, Inc., Goshen Coach, Inc., El Dorado National (California), Inc., and El Dorado National (Kansas), Inc. As a result of the divestiture of the bus business, the results of operations of the bus business are reported as Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. See Note 3, &#147;Discontinued Operations,&#148; in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

&#160; Recreational Vehicles 

Overview 

We manufacture a wide variety of recreational vehicles in the United States and sell those vehicles primarily throughout the United States and Canada, as well as related parts and accessories. Recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (&#147;RVIA&#148;). The principal types of towable recreational vehicles that we produce include conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels. In addition, we also produce truck and folding campers and equestrian and other specialty towable recreational vehicles, as well as Class A, Class C and Class B motorhomes. 

&#160; 

Travel trailers are non-motorized vehicles which are designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs or vans. Travel trailers provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. We produce &#147;conventional&#148; and &#147;fifth wheel&#148; travel trailers. Conventional trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle. Fifth wheel trailers, designed to be towed by pickup trucks, are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to a receiver in the bed area of the pickup truck. 

A motorhome is a self-powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis. Motorhomes are self-contained with their own lighting, heating, cooking, refrigeration, sewage holding and water storage facilities, so that they can be utilized without being attached to utilities. 

Class A motorhomes, generally constructed on medium-duty truck chassis, are supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by motor vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, Freightliner and Spartan Motors. We design, manufacture and install the living area and driver&#146;s compartment of Class A motorhomes. Class C and Class B motorhomes are generally built on a Ford, General Motors or Mercedes Benz small truck or van chassis, which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. We construct a living area which has access to the driver&#146;s compartment and attaches to the cab section. Although they are not designed for permanent or semi-permanent living, motorhomes can provide comfortable living facilities for camping and vacationing purposes. 

Production 

In order to minimize finished inventory, our recreational vehicles generally are produced to dealer order. Our facilities are designed to provide efficient assembly line manufacturing of products. Capacity increases can generally be achieved quickly and at relatively low cost, largely by increasing the number of production employees or by acquiring or leasing additional facilities and equipment. 

We purchase in finished form many of the components used in the production of our recreational vehicles. The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for motorhomes and travel trailers are aluminum, lumber, plywood, plastic, fiberglass and steel purchased from numerous suppliers. We believe that, except for chassis and certain key towable RV components sourced from one major supplier, substitute sources for raw materials and components are generally available with no material impact on our operations. 

Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other RV vendor relationships in that no long-term contractual commitments are entered into by either party. Historically, chassis manufacturers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when chassis supply is restricted. These allocations are generally based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. Sales of motorhomes rely on these chassis and are affected accordingly. We have not experienced any recent unusual cost increases from our chassis suppliers. 

Generally, all of our RV operating subsidiaries introduce new or improved lines or models of recreational vehicles each year. Changes typically include new sizes and floor plans, different decors or design features and engineering and technological improvements. 

Seasonality 

Since recreational vehicles are used primarily by vacationers and campers, our recreational vehicle sales tend to be seasonal and, in most geographical areas, tend to be significantly lower during the winter months than in other periods. As a result, recreational vehicle sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends on January 31 of each year. 

Marketing and Distribution 

We market our recreational vehicles through independent dealers located primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries maintains its own dealer organization, with many dealers carrying more than one of our product lines. In addition, Jayco maintains agreements with certain exclusive dealers to carry only Jayco products. As of July 31, 2016, there were approximately 2,200 dealerships carrying our products in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that close working relationships between our management and sales personnel and the many independent dealers with which we work provide us with valuable information on customer preferences and the quality and marketability of our products. 

Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries has an independent sales force to call on their dealers. Our most important sales events occur at the major recreational vehicle shows which take place throughout the year at different locations across the country. We benefit from the recreational vehicle awareness advertising and major marketing programs sponsored by the RVIA in national print media and television. We have historically engaged in a limited amount of consumer-oriented advertising for our recreational vehicles, primarily through industry magazines, product brochures, direct mail advertising campaigns and the internet. 

In our selection of individual dealers, we emphasize the dealer&#146;s ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of our products, as well as their financial stability, credit worthiness, reputation, experience and ability to provide service to the end customer. Many of our dealers carry the recreational vehicle lines of one or more of our competitors. Generally, each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries has sales agreements with their dealers. 

&#160; 

One of our dealers, FreedomRoads, LLC, accounted for 20% of our continuing consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 and 17% in both fiscal 2015 and 2014, with the increase in fiscal 2016 partially due to FreedomRoads&#146; acquisitions of formerly independent RV dealerships. This dealer also accounted for 18% of the Company&#146;s consolidated trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2016 and 22% at July 31, 2015. 

We generally do not finance dealer purchases. Most dealers are financed on a &#147;floor plan&#148; basis by an unrelated bank or financing company which lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price and retains a security interest in the vehicles purchased. As is customary in the recreational vehicle industry, we will execute a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer&#146;s purchase of our products upon the lending institution&#146;s request. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to eighteen months after a unit is financed, and in the event of default by the dealer and notification from the lending institution of the dealer default, we will repurchase all the dealer units repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is often less than 100% of the dealer&#146;s cost. The risk of loss under repurchase agreements is spread over numerous dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the units which we would be required to repurchase. We believe that any future losses under these agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our Company. The losses incurred due to repurchase were $818, $1,265 and $288 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Backlog 

As of July 31, 2016, the backlog for towable and motorized recreational vehicle orders was $735,085 and $461,762, respectively, compared to $304,005 and $269,961, respectively, at July 31, 2015, reflecting increases of 141.8% and 71.0%, respectively. The acquisition of Jayco added $223,403 and $122,535 to the towables and motorized backlog, respectively, at July 31, 2016, and accounted for 73.5% and 45.3%, respectively, of the towables and motorized percentage increases noted above. 

Backlog represents unfilled dealer orders on a particular day which can and do fluctuate on a seasonal basis. In the recreational vehicle business our manufacturing time is relatively short. The existing backlog of towable and motorized recreational vehicles is expected to be filled in fiscal 2017. 

Historically, the amount of our current backlog compared to our backlog in previous periods reflects general economic and industry conditions and, together with other relevant factors such as continued acceptance of our products by the consumer, may be an indicator of our revenues in the near term. 

Product Warranties 

We generally provide retail purchasers of our recreational vehicles with a one-year or two-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components. The chassis and engines of our motorhomes are generally warranted for various periods in excess of one year by their manufacturers. 

Regulation 

We are subject to the provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (&#147;NTMVSA&#148;) and the safety standards for recreational vehicles and recreational vehicle components which have been promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Because of our sales in Canada, we are also governed by similar laws and regulations issued by the Canadian government. 

We are a member of the RVIA, a voluntary association of recreational vehicle manufacturers which promulgates recreational vehicle safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our recreational vehicles to certify that the RVIA&#146;s standards have been met. 

Both federal and state authorities have various environmental control standards relating to air, water and noise pollution which affect our business and operations. For example, these standards, which are generally applicable to all companies, control our choice of paints, our air compressor discharge, our waste water and the noise emitted by our factories. We rely upon certifications obtained by chassis manufacturers with respect to compliance by our vehicles with all applicable emission control standards. 

We are also subject to the regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#147;OSHA&#148;). Our plants are periodically inspected by federal agencies concerned with health and safety in the work place, and by the RVIA, to ensure that our plants and products comply with applicable governmental and industry standards. 

We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable vehicle safety, environmental, RVIA and OSHA regulations. 

We do not believe that ongoing compliance with the regulations discussed above will have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by low barriers to entry. The recreational vehicle market is intensely competitive, with several other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. We also experience a certain level of competition between our own operating subsidiaries. Increased activity in the market for used recreational vehicles also impacts manufacturers&#146; sales of new products. Competition in the recreational vehicle industry is based upon price, design, value, quality and service. We believe that the quality, design and price of our products and the warranty coverage and service that we provide allow us to compete favorably for retail purchasers of recreational vehicles. There are approximately 70 RV manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, according to RVIA. 

Our primary competitor within the towable segment is Forest River, Inc., while our primary competitors within the motorized segment are Winnebago Industries, Inc. and Forest River, Inc. We estimate that, in the aggregate, we are one of the largest recreational vehicle manufacturers in terms of both units produced and revenue. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., for the six months ended June 30, 2016, Thor&#146;s combined U.S. and Canadian market share, excluding Jayco, was approximately 35.7% for travel trailers and fifth wheels and approximately 25.3% for motorhomes. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Jayco&#146;s combined U.S. and Canadian market share, which reflects results prior to its acquisition by Thor, was approximately 14.7% for travel trailers and fifth wheels and approximately 9.2% for motorhomes. 

Trademarks and Patents 

We have registered United States trademarks, Canadian trademarks, certain international trademarks and licenses carrying the principal trade names and model lines under which our products are marketed. We hold and protect certain patents related to our business. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business. 

Employee Relations 

At July 31, 2016, we employed, including Jayco, approximately 14,900 full-time employees in the United States, of which approximately 1,780 were salaried. The acquisition of Jayco added approximately 3,400 full-time employees, of which approximately 480 were salaried. None of our employees are represented by certified labor organizations. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees. 

Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 

We manufacture all of our recreational vehicles in the United States. Export sales from our continuing operations, predominantly to Canada, were $368,426, $465,642 and $521,818 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the fiscal 2016 and 2015 totals being adversely impacted by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar during those periods.
