 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

We operate as one business segment and are a provider of comprehensive home and community based personal care services, which are provided primarily in the home, and focused on the dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) population. Our personal care services provide assistance with activities of daily living, and adult day care. Our consumers are primarily persons who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization, such as the elderly, chronically ill and disabled. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. We currently provide personal care services to over 32,000 consumers through 119 locations across 22 states, including five adult day centers in Illinois. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we served on average 48,000, 43,000 and 42,000 consumers, respectively. 

A summary of our financial results for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is provided in the table below:

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; Historically, our services were provided under agreements with state and local government agencies established to meet the needs of our consumers. Our consumers are predominately &#147;dual eligible&#148; and as such are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid funded home-based personal care. As a result of certain legislation enacted by the federal government, states are being incentivized to initiate dual eligible demonstration programs and other managed Medicaid initiatives, which are designed to coordinate the services provided through these two programs, with the overall objectives to better coordinate service delivery and, over the long term, to reduce costs. Increasingly, states are implementing these managed care programs and as such are transitioning management of individuals such as our consumers to local and national managed care organizations. Under these arrangements the managed care organizations have an economic incentive to provide home and community based services to consumers as a means to better manage the acute care expenditures of their membership. Managed care revenues account for 18.3% of our revenue mix. 

The home and community based services we provide include assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, personal hygiene and medication reminders, and other activities of daily living. We provide these services on a long-term, continuous basis, with an average duration of approximately 21 months per consumer. Our adult day centers provide a comprehensive program of skilled and support services and designated medical services for adults in a community-based group setting. Services provided by our adult day centers include social activities, transportation services to and from the centers, the provision of meals and snacks, personal care and therapeutic activities such as exercise and cognitive interaction. 

Our model is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction, as well as lower the cost of acute care treatment and reduce service duplication. We believe our model to be especially valuable to managed care organizations that have economic responsibility for both home and community services as well as acute care expenditures. Over the long term, we believe our model will be a differentiator and as a result we expect to receive increased referrals from the managed care organizations. 

&#160; 

We utilize our home care aides to observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of early intervention in the disease process, thereby preventing or reducing the cost of medical services by avoiding emergency room visits, and/or reducing the need for hospitalization. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other health care agencies as appropriate. Changes in consumers&#146; conditions are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and referred to either appropriate medical personnel including the consumers&#146; primary care physicians or managed care organizations for treatment and follow-up. We believe this approach to the care of our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum are attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs and costs of our consumers, and over time will increase our business with them. 

We are investing in technology-based solutions to support and facilitate our coordinated care model. We utilize Interactive Voice Response (&#147;IVR&#148;) systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the homecare aides. Through these applications we are able to identify changes in health conditions with automated alerts forwarded to appropriate management team for triaging and evaluation. In addition, the technology is used to record basic transaction information about each visit including; start and end times to a scheduled shift, mileage reimbursement, text messages to the homecare aide and communication of basic payroll information. 

In addition to our focus on organic growth, we are growing through selective acquisitions which expand our presence in current markets or which facilitate our entry into new markets where the home and community based business is moving to managed care organizations. We completed five acquisitions in December 2013, June 2014 January 2015 and November 2015, respectively, that either expanded our presence in existing markets or provided us with a base of operations in new targeted managed care states. Additionally, on April 24, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire South Shore Home Service Inc. and Acaring Home Care, LLC to expand into the State of New York. The transaction was consummated effective February 5, 2016. 

Effective March 1, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets used in our home health business (the &#147;Home Health Business&#148;) in Arkansas, Nevada and South Carolina, and 90% of the Home Health Business in California and Illinois, to subsidiaries of LHC Group, Inc. (the &#147;Purchasers&#148;) for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.0 million. We retained a 10% ownership interest in the Home Health Business in California and Illinois. The assets sold included 19 home health agencies and two hospice agencies in five states. On December 30, 2013, we sold one home health agency in Pennsylvania for approximately $200.0 thousand. The results of the Home Health Business sold are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Continuing operations include the results of operations previously included in our home &#38; community segment and three agencies previously included in our home health segment. Following the sale of the Home Health Business, we manage and internally report our business in one segment. Because regulatory requirements in Delaware and Indiana require home and community based services to be provided by a licensed home health agency, we will continue to provide limited home health services reimbursable by Medicare in these agencies in order to maintain these licenses. In addition, our Priority Home Health Care operations in Ohio maintain enrollment in, but do not derive significant revenues from, Medicare. 

We believe the sale of the Home Health Business substantially positioned us for future growth. The sale allowed us to focus both management and financial resources to address changes in the home and community based services industry and to address the needs of managed care organizations as they become more responsible for the state sponsored programs. We have improved our financial performance by concentrating our efforts on our home and community business that is growing and profitable. We have improved our overall financial position by eliminating our debt and adding to our cash reserves. 

&#160; 

Addus HomeCare Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 2006 under the name Addus Holding Corporation for the purpose of acquiring Addus HealthCare, Inc. (&#147;Addus HealthCare&#148;). Addus HealthCare was founded in 1979. Our principal executive offices are located at 2300 Warrenville Road, Downers Grove, Illinois 60615. Our telephone number is 630-296-3400. Our internet address is www.addus.com. Through our website, we make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such information to the SEC. 

Our Market and Opportunity 

We provide home and community based personal care services to the elderly and other adult infirm who need long-term care and assistance with activities of daily living. A report by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), in consultation with Truven Health Analytics, from April 28, 2014, estimated total Medicaid expenditures for home and community based services in 2012 (the most recent year in their data set) to be almost $70 billion, representing an annual compound rate of growth of 8.2% over the period from 2007-2012. The report also notes that spending on home and community based services constituted about 50% of total spending in 2012 by Medicaid on the group of programs Medicaid refers to as &#147;long-term services and supports&#148; (with the remaining 50% being spent on institutional programs, i.e. nursing homes and mental health facilities), up from 18% in 1995 (the earliest year in the data set). 

In addition to the projected growth of government-sponsored home and community based services, the private duty market for our services is growing rapidly. We provide our private duty consumers with all of the services we provide to our government-sponsored home and community based consumers. 

Historically, there were limited barriers to entry in the home and community based services industry. As a result, the home and community based services industry developed in a highly fragmented manner, with many small local providers. Few companies have a significant market share across multiple regions or states. According to the National Association for Home Care &#38; Hospice, or NAHC, as of 2013, there were over 33,000 homecare and hospice agencies in the United States. Approximately 15,000 were Medicare-certified homecare and hospice agencies, while the remaining 18,000 represent the number of licensed home and community based services agencies in the United States providing services similar to those we provide. In addition, while difficult to estimate, there are many non-licensed, non-certified home and community based services agencies. 

More recently, the home and community based services industry has been subject to increased regulation. In several states, providers are now required to obtain state licenses or registrations and must comply with laws and regulations governing standards of practice. Providers must dedicate substantial resources to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable regulations and significant expenditures may be necessary to offer new services or to expand into new markets. Any failure to comply with this growing and changing regulatory regime could lead to the termination of rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs and the suspension or revocation of licenses. We believe limitations on the availability of new licenses, the increasing focus on improving health outcomes, the rising cost and complexity of operations and pressure on reimbursement rates due to constrained government resources may create barriers for new providers and may encourage industry consolidation. 

The Federal Coordinated Health Care Office was established to effectively integrate benefits for consumers who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid, also known as dual eligibles, and improve coordination between the federal and state governments to ensure that dual eligibles have full access to items and services to which they are entitled. Stated goals of the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office are to ensure that the dual eligible population has full access to seamless high quality health care and to make the system as cost-effective as possible. The Federal Coordinated Health Care Office works with the CMS, state Medicaid agencies, and other federal and state agencies, as well as physicians and others, to provide technical assistance and educational 

&#160; 

tools to improve care coordination between Medicare and Medicaid and to reduce costs, improve beneficiary experience and educate dual eligibles regarding care coverage. It also performs policy and program analysis and develops policy and program recommendations regarding dual eligibles. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, both laws are referred to herein as the &#147;Health Reform Act&#148;) encourages states to integrate the state managed Medicaid home and community based programs with managed Medicare programs. The objective of these initiatives is to enhance the coordination of benefits between the two programs and to lower overall costs. The integrated programs are being structured as three year pilots. Nationally, 13 states are currently pursuing financial or administrative alignment for dual eligible beneficiaries, including 7 of the 22 states in which we provide services. 

We believe that our personal care program and our commitment to our technology platform make us well-suited to partner with managed care organizations to address the needs of the dual eligible population. These programs reduce service duplication between home and community based programs and traditional Medicare home health. We believe our ability to identify changes in our consumers&#146; health and condition before the medical need requires acute intervention will lower the overall cost of care and will be recognized as an added benefit of our services. We believe this approach to the provision of care to our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare continuum is particularly attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them. 

Our Growth Strategy 

Our net service revenues growth is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services. Our continued growth depends on our ability to provide consistently high quality care, maintain our existing payor client relationships, establish relationships with new payors and increase our referral sources. Our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services. We believe there are several market opportunities for growth. The U.S. population of persons aged 65 and older is growing, and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that this population will more than double by 2050. Additionally, we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes or community-based settings. Finally, we believe the provision of home and community based services is more cost-effective than the provision of similar services in an institutional setting for long-term care. The following are the key elements of our growth strategy: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Consistently provide high-quality care. We schedule our home care aides to perform their services at times mutually determined by our consumers. The home care aides are required to perform tasks as defined within the individual plan of care. We manage the performance of our home care aides through regular visits while in our consumer homes. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Drive growth in existing markets. We are growing in our existing markets overall by enhancing the breadth of our services, increasing the number of referral sources and leveraging and expanding our payor relationships in each market. We are achieving this growth by continuing to educate referral sources about the benefits of our services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Market the benefits of our coordinated care model to managed care organizations serving the dual eligible populations. Our coordinated care model provides significant opportunities to effectively market to a wide range of payor clients and referral sources, many of whom are responsible for consumers with both social and medical service needs. We are seeking to partner with managed care organizations to address the needs of the dual eligible population in light of governmental incentives for consumers to enroll in managed care plans. We believe that our approach to the provision of care to our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare industry is particularly attractive to managed care organizations and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time we believe this approach will increase our business. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Grow through acquisitions . We continue to grow with selective acquisitions. Our strategy is to expand within our existing markets and to enter markets where states are transitioning the management of home and community services to managed care organizations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand into new markets. We offer our services in geographic markets contiguous to our existing markets through de novo agency development. We also anticipate we will have opportunities to develop new agencies in response to requests from managed care organizations. 

Our Services 

We deliver services to our consumers through 119 individual agencies located in 22 states and 5 adult day centers in Illinois. Our home and community based services assist consumers, who would otherwise be at risk of placement in a long-term care institution, with activities of daily living. 

Services are primarily provided to older adults and younger disabled persons in consumers&#146; homes on an as-needed, hourly basis. These services, generally provided by home and community based service aides, include non-medical care such as personal care, home support services and adult day care. 

Personal care and home support services are provided to consumers who are unable to independently perform some or all of their activities of daily living. Our services are needed when assistance from family or community members is insufficient or where caregivers respite is needed. Personal care services include bathing, grooming, oral care, skincare, assistance with feeding and dressing and medication reminders. Home support services include meal planning and preparation, housekeeping and transportation services. Many consumers need such services on a long-term basis to address chronic or acute conditions. Each payor client establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, and establishes the applicable reimbursement rate in accordance with applicable law. The average duration of our provision of home and community based services is approximately 21 months per consumer. 

We also operate five adult day centers in Illinois which provide a comprehensive program of skilled and support services and designated health services for adults in a community-based group setting. Services provided by our adult day centers include social activities, transportation services to and from the centers, the provision of meals and snacks, personal care and therapeutic activities such as exercise and cognitive interaction. 

Our payor clients are principally federal, state and local governmental agencies and managed care organizations. The federal, state and local programs under which they operate are subject to legislative, budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates. Managed care organizations as an extension of our state payors are subject to similar economic pressures. Our commercial insurance carrier payor clients are typically for profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs. We are also seeking to grow our private duty business. 

Most of our services are provided pursuant to agreements with state and local governmental social and aging service agencies. These agreements generally have a term of one to two years and may be terminated with 60 days&#146; notice. They are typically renewed for one to five-year terms, provided that we have complied with licensing, certification and program standards, and other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Managed care organizations are becoming an increasing portion of our payor mix as states shift from the management of their programs to managed care organizations. In 2015, approximately 77.7% of our net service revenues from continuing operations were derived from state and local government programs, with 18.3% derived from managed care organizations, while approximately 4.0% of net service revenues from continuing operations were derived from insurance programs and private duty consumers. 

&#160; 

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenue mix by payor type for continuing operations was as follows:

We also measure the performance of our business through review of our billable hours per client, billable hours per business day, revenues per billable hour and the number of consumers served, or census. 

Competition 

The home and community based services industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market specific. Each local market has its own competitive profile and no single competitor has significant market share across all of our markets. Our competition consists of home and community based service providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations, managed care organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive. This is particularly true in California where individuals act as independent providers who provide services for a consumer and are paid directly by the county where services are delivered. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into our markets. Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources and name recognition with consumers and payors. 

Sales and Marketing 

We focus on initiating and maintaining working relationships with state and local governmental agencies responsible for the provision of the services we offer. We target these agencies in our current markets and in geographical areas that we have identified as potential markets for expansion. We also seek to identify service needs 

&#160; 

or changes in the service delivery or reimbursement system of governmental entities and attempt to work with and provide input to the responsible government personnel, provider associations and consumer advocacy groups. 

We are establishing new referral relationships with various managed care organizations who are contracting with the states for the management of the state Medicaid programs under dual eligible demonstration and similar Medicaid managed care programs. We have met with all contracted managed care organizations in markets where we serve our clients and are building those relationships necessary to ensure continued referrals of new clients. 

We receive substantially all of our consumers from third-party referrals. Generally, family members of potential consumers are made aware of available in-home or alternative living arrangements through a state or local case management system. These systems are operated by governmental or private agencies. We receive referrals from state departments on aging, rehabilitation, mental health and children&#146;s services, county departments of social services, the Veterans Health Administration and city departments on aging. 

We provide ongoing education and outreach to our target communities, both to inform the community about state and locally-subsidized care options and to communicate our role in providing quality home and community based services. We also utilize consumer-direct sales, marketing and advertising programs designed to attract consumers. 

Payment for Services 

We are compensated for substantially all of our services by federal, state and local government programs, such as Medicaid funded programs and Medicaid waiver programs, other state agencies, the Veterans Health Administration, commercial and managed care organizations and private duty consumers. 

The following table sets forth net service revenues from continuing operations derived from each of our major payors during the indicated periods as a percentage of total net service revenues from continuing operations.

We provide home and community based services pursuant to agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, which is funded by Medicaid and general revenue funds of the State of Illinois. Consumers are identified by case managers contracted independently with the Illinois Department on Aging. Once a consumer has been evaluated and determined to be eligible for the program, the case manager refers the consumer to a list of authorized providers, from which the consumer selects the provider. We provide our services in accordance with a care plan developed by the case manager and under administrative directives from the Illinois Department on Aging. We are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis. 

&#160; 

Due to its revenue deficiencies and delay in finalizing a budget, as well as financing issues, the State of Illinois is currently providing reimbursement on a delayed basis with respect to these agreements. These payment delays could adversely impact our liquidity, and may result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility. Other delayed payor reimbursements from the State of Illinois could contribute to an increase in our receivables balances. 

Washington Department of Social and Health Services 

We provide home and community based services pursuant to agreements with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services, which is funded by Medicaid and general revenue funds of the State of Washington. Consumers are identified by area Agency on Aging case managers contracted independently with the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. Once a consumer has been evaluated and determined to be eligible for the program, the case manager refers the consumer to a list of authorized providers, from which the consumer selects the provider. We provide our services in accordance with a care plan developed by the case manager and under administrative directives from the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. We are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis. 

United HealthCare of New Mexico 

We provide services under contract with United HealthCare of New Mexico (&#147;United HealthCare&#148;) under the Community Long Term Care Services (CoLTS) program. This is a managed Medicaid program pursuant to which the State of New Mexico has contracted with several commercial insurance payers to manage home and community based services as well as other long-term social services. Under this agreement, consumers are qualified for services and referred to us by United Healthcare. We provide personal care and other in-home support services under this program. Our relationship with United HealthCare is not exclusive, as United HealthCare has a network of providers from which it receives similar services and from which the consumers select a provider. All services are reimbursed on an hourly fee-for-service basis. 

Other Federal, State and Local Payors 

Medicaid Funded Programs and Medicaid Waiver Programs 

Medicaid is a state-administered program that provides certain social and medical services to qualified low-income individuals, and is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. Reimbursement rates and methods vary by state and service type, but are typically based on an hourly or unit-of-service basis. Rates are subject to adjustment based on statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, government funding limitations and interpretations of policy by individual state agencies. Within guidelines established by federal statutes and regulations, each state establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type, amount, duration and scope of services, sets the rate of payment for services and administers its own program, subject to federal oversight. Most states cover Medicaid beneficiaries for intermittent home health services, as well as continuous services for children and young adults with complicated medical conditions, and certain states cover home and community-based services. 

In an effort to control escalating Medicaid costs, states are increasingly requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans. Under a health reform bill signed into law in January 2012, Illinois set a goal to increase the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care plans from the then current 8% to 50% by 2015. The State fell just short of that goal, enrolling approximately 1.4 million of its 3.1 million Medicaid population in managed care plans as of January 2015. As of December, 2015, Illinois had enrolled over 2,000,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in all total care coordination programs. Under these managed care programs, states are increasingly requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to work with case managers. 

&#160; 

Veterans Health Administration 

The Veterans Health Administration operates the nation&#146;s largest integrated health care system, with more than 1,800 sites of care, and provides health care benefits, including home and community based services, to eligible military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration provides funding to regional and local offices and facilities that support the in-home care needs of eligible aged and disabled veterans by contracting directly with local in-home care providers, and to the aid and attendance pension, which pays veterans for their otherwise unreimbursed health and long-term care expenses. We currently have relationships and agreements with the Veterans Health Administration to provide home and community based services in several states, with the largest Veterans Health Administration services being provided to eligible consumers in Illinois, Arkansas and California. 

Other 

Other sources of funding are available to support home and community based services in different states and localities. In addition, many states appropriate general funds or special use funds through targeted taxes or lotteries to finance home and community based services for senior citizens and people with disabilities. Depending on the state, these funds may be used to supplement existing Medicaid waiver programs or for distinct programs that serve non-Medicaid eligible consumers. 

Other Managed Care Organizations 

Many states are moving the administration of their Medicaid home and community based programs to commercially-managed care insurance companies. This transition is due to federal and state initiatives to address the needs of the dual eligible population and an overall desire to better manage the costs of the Medicaid long term care programs. Reimbursement from the managed care organizations is generally on an hourly, fee-for-service basis with rates consistent with the individual state funded rates. 

Private Duty 

Our private duty services are provided on an hourly basis. Our rates are established to achieve a pre-determined gross profit margin, and are competitive with those of other local providers. We bill our private duty consumers for services rendered either bi-monthly or monthly, and in certain circumstances we obtain a two- week deposit from the consumer. Other private duty payors include workers&#146; compensation programs/insurance, preferred provider organizations and employers. 

Commercial Insurance/Long-Term Care Insurance 

Most long-term care insurance policies contain benefits for in-home services and adult day care. Policies are generally subject to dollar limitations on the amount of daily, weekly or monthly coverage provided. Depending on the type of service, coverage for services may be predicated on a physician or nurse determination that the care is necessary or on the development of a plan for care in the home. 

Exposure for Payments Previously Received 

As described above under the caption &#147;Business&#151;Overview,&#148; we sold our Home Health Business effective March 1, 2013, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 7, 2013 (the &#147;Home Health Purchase Agreement&#148;), with LHC Group, Inc. and the Purchasers identified therein. Pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we retained a 10% ownership interest in the Home Health Business in California and Illinois. In addition, not included in the sale were four home health agencies in Delaware, Idaho, Indiana and Pennsylvania. The home health agency in Pennsylvania was sold on December 30, 2013 and the agency in Idaho was closed in November 2012 and efforts to sell the Idaho agency were abandoned in December 2013. 

&#160; 

While we no longer receive substantial payments from Medicare for home health services, pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the consummation of the sale (the &#147;Closing&#148;) and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any health care laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive adjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers for the amount of such adjustments. 

Medicare is the U.S. government&#146;s health insurance program funded by the Social Security Administration for individuals aged 65 or older, individuals under the age of 65 with certain disabilities and individuals of all ages with end-stage renal disease. Eligibility for Medicare does not depend on income, and coverage is restricted to reasonable and medically-necessary treatment. 

Medicare home health rates are based on a Medicare episodic rate set annually through federal legislation. The rate covers a 60-day episode of care. Payment for each patient&#146;s episode of care is based on the severity of the consumer&#146;s condition, his or her service needs and other factors relating to the cost of providing services and supplies. 

In addition, Medicare payments can be adjusted through changes in the payment rate and recoveries of overpayments for, among other things, unusually costly care for a particular consumer, low utilization, transfers to another provider, the level of therapy services required, the number of episodes of care provided, and if the consumer is discharged but readmitted within the same 60-day episodic period. In addition, Medicare can also reduce levels of reimbursement if a provider is unable to produce appropriate billing documentation or acceptable medical authorizations. 

Insurance Programs and Costs 

We maintain workers&#146; compensation, general and professional liability, automobile, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability, fiduciary liability and excess liability insurance. We offer various health insurance plans to eligible full-time and part-time employees. We believe our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves are adequate for our current operations. However, we cannot assure you that any potential losses or asserted claims will not exceed such insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves. 

Employees 

The following is a breakdown of our part- and full-time employees, as well as the employees in our National Support Center, as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Our home and community based service aides provide substantially all of our services and comprise approximately 96.2% of our total workforce. They undergo a criminal background check, and are provided with pre-service training and orientation and an evaluation of their skills. In many cases, home and community based services aides are also required to attend ongoing in-services education. In certain states, our home and community based services aides are required to complete certified training programs and maintain a state certification; however, no state in which we operate requires home and community based services aides to maintain a license similar to that of a nurse or therapist. Approximately 48.6% of our total employees are represented by labor unions. We maintain strong working relationships with these labor unions. We have a national agreement with the Service Employees International Union (the &#147;SEIU&#148;). Wages and benefits are negotiated at the local level at various times throughout the year. 

Technology 

We have licensed the Horizon Homecare software solution (&#147;Horizon Homecare&#148;) from McKesson Information Solutions, LLC (&#147;McKesson&#148;), to address our administrative, office, clinical and operating information system needs, including compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, requirements. Horizon Homecare assists our staff in gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimize financial performance, adjust consumer mix, promote regulatory compliance and enhance staff efficiency. Horizon Homecare supports intake, personnel scheduling, office, clinical and reimbursement management in an integrated database. Horizon Homecare is hosted by McKesson in a secure data center, which provides multiple redundancies for storage, power, bandwidth and security. Using this technology, we are able to standardize the care delivered across our network of locations and effectively monitor our performance and consumer outcomes. 

During the first quarter of 2015, we completed our transition from an internally developed and customized payroll management system to calculate and produce our payroll to a commercial human resource and payroll system vendor, provided by Ultimate Software. The Ultimate Software solution is a web based provider of integrated human resource and payroll software, which supports our management with the systems and reporting necessary to manage our employees. Both software systems are integrated with Horizon Homecare and other clinical data-management systems, and include features for tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments, on-site check printing, general ledger population and direct-deposit paychecks. Secure management reports are made available centrally and through our internal reporting module. 

We utilize commercial vendors for electronic visit verification pursuant to which our home and community based service aids record their beginning and ending times for services provided through either an IVR system or cell phone based system. We have supplemented these commercial systems with company developed mobile applications that allow our homecare aides the ability to communicate with our support center, to request additional work if available, to monitor or change their schedules and to inquire about payroll information. In addition, our software development includes features to allow our homecare aides to communicate changes in the health condition of our consumers. We utilize this information to support our coordinated care model and to communicate to managed care organizations. 

Government Regulation 

Overview 

Our business is subject to extensive and increasing federal, state and local regulation. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible activities, the relative cost of doing business, and the methods and amounts of payment for care by both governmental and other payors. Departments of the federal government are currently considering how to implement programs and policy changes and mandated demonstration projects in the Health Reform Act. As a result of the Health Reform 

&#160; 

Act, it is expected that the number of Medicaid beneficiaries will increase (although several states in which we operate have declined to expand Medicaid eligibility) and in addition, there may be additional increases if employers terminate their employee health plans. It is impossible to know at this time what effect, if any, this will have on budgetary allocations for our services. The health care industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, extensive and dynamic change. In addition, differences among state laws may impede our ability to expand into certain markets. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate and our ability to participate in federal or state programs. See also &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Overview.&#148; 

Medicaid Participation 

To participate in and qualify for reimbursement under Medicaid programs, we are subject to various requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. If we were to violate the applicable federal and state regulations, we could be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties. New federal regulations took effect on March 17, 2014 setting forth eligibility requirements for home and community based services provided under Medicaid waiver programs. The regulations specify that home and community based settings must be integrated in and support full access to the greater community, selected by individuals from among different setting options, ensure privacy rights of individuals, optimize autonomy and independence in making life choices, and facilitate individual choice regarding services and supports. In addition, the regulations impose several conditions on provider-owned or controlled residential settings. All states were required to submit transition plans to CMS by March 17, 2015, detailing any actions necessary for the state to achieve compliance with the new requirements. We may face additional costs associated with compliance with these regulations, but it is difficult to ascertain the impact of these costs at this time and these costs will vary from state to state depending on how the requirements are implemented. 

Health Reform Act 

The Health Reform Act includes several provisions that may affect reimbursement for our services. The Health Reform Act is broad, sweeping reform, and is subject to change, including through the adoption or revision of related regulations, the way in which its provisions are interpreted and the manner in which it is enforced. Although the Health Reform Act provides for expansion of eligibility for Medicaid enrollment, 16 states, including some in which we do business, have opted not to participate in Medicaid expansion. The Health Reform Act also creates within CMS a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI, to test innovative payment and service delivery systems to reduce program expenditures while maintaining or enhancing quality. Among the issues that are to be addressed by CMMI are: allowing the states to test new models of care for individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, supporting &#147;continuing care hospitals&#148; that offer post-acute care during the 30 days following discharge, funding home health providers that offer chronic care management services, and establishing pilot programs that bundle acute care hospital services with physician services and post-acute care services, including home health services for patients with certain selected conditions. We may have difficulty negotiating for a fair share of the bundled payment. In addition, we may be unfairly penalized if a consumer is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge for reasons beyond our control. 

We cannot assure you that the provisions described above, or that any other provisions of the Health Reform Act or amendment thereto, will not adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial position. 

Permits and Licensure 

Our home and community based services are authorized and / or licensed under various state and county requirements. Our home and community based aides generally have no licensure requirements, although in 

&#160; 

certain states, they are required to complete training programs and maintain state certification. We believe we are currently licensed appropriately where required by the laws of the states in which we operate, but additional licensing requirements may be imposed upon us in existing markets or markets that we enter in the future. 

Applicable Federal and State Laws 

Anti-Kickback Laws: The federal government enforces the federal law, commonly known as the Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration to or from any person or entity to induce or in exchange for the referral of patients covered by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute also prohibits the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for any item, facility or service covered by the government payment programs (or the recommendation thereof) in exchange for such referrals. Many states, including Illinois, Nevada and California also have similar laws proscribing kickbacks, some of which are not limited to services for which government-funded payment may be made. Violations of these provisions are punishable by criminal fines, civil penalties, imprisonment or exclusion from participation in reimbursement programs. 

The Stark Law and other Prohibitions on Physician Self-Referral : We may also be affected by the federal law, commonly known as the &#147;Stark Law,&#148; that prohibits physicians from making a referral for health care items or services, including home health services, if they, or their family members, have a financial relationship with the entity receiving the referral unless certain conditions are met. Violations are punishable by civil monetary penalties on both the person making the referral and the provider rendering the service. Such persons or entities are also subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. We believe our compensation agreements with physicians who served as medical directors in our home health agencies meet the requirements for the personal services exception and that our operations comply with the Stark Law. 

Many states, including Illinois, Nevada and California have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the Stark Law. 

Beneficiary Inducement Prohibition : The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (&#147;CMPL&#148;) imposes substantial penalties for offering remuneration or other inducements to influence federal health care beneficiaries&#146; decisions to seek specific governmentally reimbursable items or services, or to choose particular providers. The CMPL also can be used for civil prosecution of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Sanctions under the CMPL include substantial financial penalties as well as exclusion from participation in all federal and state health care programs. 

The False Claims Act : Under the federal False Claims Act, the government may fine any person, company or corporation that knowingly submits, or participates in submitting, claims for payment to the federal government which are false or fraudulent, or which contain false or misleading information. Any such person or entity that knowingly makes or uses a false record or statement to avoid paying the federal government may also be subject to fines under the False Claims Act. Private parties may initiate whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the government and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit. The penalty for violation of the False Claims Act is a minimum of $5,500 and a maximum of $11,000 for each fraudulent claim plus three times the amount of damages caused to the government as a result of each fraudulent claim. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties as well as exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to the False Claims Act, the federal government may use several criminal statutes to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. 

A provision of the Health Reform Act implemented a requirement that health care providers report and return overpayments received from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identifying the overpayment, or by the date any applicable corresponding cost report is due (whichever is later). Overpayments may include payments for services for which the provider does not have proper documentation, and failure to report and return overpayments within the applicable time period can subject providers to liability under the False Claims 

&#160; 

Act. On February 12, 2016, CMS published final regulations interpreting the 60-day rule&#146;s application to overpayments under Medicare Part A and Part B. In pertinent part, the final regulations clarify when an overpayment is &#147;identified&#148; for purposes of the 60-day rule, and obligate providers to conduct both proactive and reactive compliance activities to identify and return overpayments. The 60-day rule regulations apply to overpayments identified within six years of the date the overpayment was received. Additionally, the statutory 60-day rule requirements continue to obligate providers to report and return Medicaid overpayments. The only federal court to consider this provision of the Health Reform Act as applied to Medicaid overpayments interpreted a provider&#146;s obligation to identify and return an overpayment broadly, holding in part that an overpayment is identified when a provider is put on notice of a potential overpayment. 

Many states, including Illinois, Nevada and California have similar false claims statutes that impose additional liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act. 

Fraud Alerts: From time to time, various federal and state agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;), issue pronouncements that identify practices that may be subject to heightened scrutiny, as well as practices that may violate fraud and abuse laws. We believe, but cannot assure you, that our operations comply with the principles expressed by the Office of the Inspector General (the &#147;OIG&#148;) in these reports and special fraud alerts. 

HIPAA and the HITECH Act: HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by &#147;HIPAA covered entities,&#148; which includes our company. In addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#147;HITECH Act&#148;) imposes additional privacy and security requirements and breach notification obligations on health care providers and on their business associates. Failure to comply with HIPAA or the HITECH Act could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Most states, including Illinois, Nevada and California, also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential personal information. 

Civil Monetary Penalties: HHS may impose civil monetary penalties upon any person or entity that presents, or causes to be presented, certain ineligible claims for medical items or services. The amount of penalties varies, depending on the offense, from $2,000 to $50,000 per violation plus treble damages for the amount at issue and exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, persons who have been excluded from the Medicare or Medicaid program may not retain ownership in a participating entity. Participating entities that permit continued ownership by excluded individuals, that contract with excluded individuals, and the excluded individuals themselves, may be penalized. Penalties are also applicable in certain other cases, including violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Law, payments to limit certain patient services and improper execution of statements of medical necessity. 

Surveys and Audits 

We are subject to routine and periodic surveys and audits by various governmental agencies and other payors. From time to time, we receive and respond to survey reports containing statements of deficiencies. Periodic and random audits conducted or directed by these agencies could result in a delay in receipt or an adjustment to the amount of reimbursements due or received under federal or state programs. Violation of the applicable federal and state health care regulations can result in excluding a health care provider from participating in the Medicare and/or Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and can subject the provider to substantial civil and/or criminal penalties. 

Pursuant to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, HHS created a permanent and national recovery audit program to identify improper Medicare payments made on claims of health care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The program uses recovery audit contractors, or RACs, to identify the improper 

&#160; 

Medicare payments and protect the Medicare Trust Fund from fraud, waste and abuse. Since the start of the program, RACs have identified more than $8 billion in improper payments. RACs are paid a contingent fee based on the improper payments identified. On December 30, 2014, CMS announced a series of changes to the RAC audit program aimed at reducing the burden on providers, enhancing CMS&#146; oversight of RACs and increasing program transparency. CMS also instituted Zone Program Integrity Contracts (&#147;ZPICs&#148;) for additional audit of Medicare providers, including home health agencies. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws 

We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, transport, use and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. In the event of an accident involving such hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all.
