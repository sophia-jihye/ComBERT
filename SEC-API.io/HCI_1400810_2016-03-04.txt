 ITEM 1 &#150; Business 

General 

HCI Group, Inc. is a Florida-based company owning subsidiaries primarily engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. HCI was incorporated in 2006. References to &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;the Company,&#148; or &#147;HCI&#148; in this Form 10-K generally refer to HCI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 5300 West Cypress Street, Suite 100, Tampa, Florida 33607, and our telephone number is (813) 849-9500. 

Over the years, we have broadened and diversified our business portfolio through acquisitions to include information technologies and investment real estate. Based on our organizational structure, revenue sources, and evaluation of financial and operating performances by management, we manage our operations under one business segment, which includes the following operations: 

&#160;

&#160; a) Insurance Operations &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Property and casualty insurance &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reinsurance &#160;

&#160; b) Other Operations &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Real estate &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Information technology Insurance Operations 

Property and Casualty Insurance 

Our principal operating subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. (&#147;HCPCI&#148;), was incorporated and began operations in 2007. Through HCPCI, we currently provide property and casualty insurance to homeowners, condominium owners and tenants residing in Florida. HCPCI&#146;s operations are supported by certain of HCI&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries as well as HCI Group, Inc.: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Homeowners Choice Managers, Inc. &#150; acts as managing general agent and provides marketing, underwriting, claims settlement, accounting and financial services to HCPCI; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Southern Administration, Inc. &#150; provides policy administration services to HCPCI. HCPCI began operations by participating in a &#147;take-out program&#148; through which we assumed insurance policies held by Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (&#147;Citizens&#148;), a Florida state-supported insurer. The take-out program is a legislatively mandated program designed to reduce the State&#146;s risk exposure by encouraging private companies to assume policies 

&#160;

from Citizens. We have assumed policies in a series of separate transactions, which took place from July 2007 through October 2015. In addition, we completed a transaction with HomeWise Insurance Company (&#147;HomeWise&#148;) in November 2011 through which we acquired its Florida policies. Substantially all of our premium revenue since inception has come from the policies acquired in these assumption transactions and subsequent renewals. Through the Citizens assumptions and HomeWise policies, we have increased our geographic diversification within the state of Florida. We currently have approximately 160,000 policies in force and approximately $400 million in annualized gross premiums. 

Citizens has historically required us to offer renewals on the policies we acquire in the take-out program for a period of three years subsequent to the initial expiration of the assumed policies. The policyholders have the option to renew with us or they may place their coverage with another insurance company. Policyholders also have the option to opt out of the assumption and return to Citizens. With respect to our November 2013 through October 2015 assumptions, the opt-out provision was limited to the thirty-day period preceding and following the assumption date. We strive to retain these policies by offering competitive rates and exceptional service to our policyholders. We may selectively pursue additional assumption transactions with Citizens in the future as opportunities arise that meet our underwriting criteria. 

We face various challenges to implementing our operating and growth strategies. Since we currently write policies that cover Florida homeowners, condominium owners, and tenants, we cover losses that may arise from, among other things, catastrophes, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. To mitigate our risk of such catastrophic losses, we cede a portion of our exposure to reinsurers under contracts called catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties and one quota share arrangement. Even without catastrophic events, we may incur losses and loss adjustment expenses that deviate substantially from our estimates and that may exceed our reserves, in which case our net income and capital would decrease. Our operating and growth strategies may also be impacted by regulation of our business by the State of Florida, which must approve our policy forms and premium rates as well as monitor HCPCI&#146;s compliance with financial and regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may compete with large, well-established insurance companies, possessing greater financial resources, larger agency networks, and greater name recognition. See Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; below. 

HCPCI began writing flood coverage in January 2014 in response to the demand for an alternative to the Federal National Flood Insurance Program for Florida homeowners. The flood coverage is offered on a limited basis as a policy endorsement to eligible Florida customers who are likely most impacted by the significant rate increases that may result from the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012. In December 2015, HCPCI was approved by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (&#147;FLOIR&#148;) to write standalone flood insurance policies for Florida homeowners. In addition, we anticipate that our recently organized and approved Florida insurance subsidiary, TypTap Insurance Company (&#147;TypTap&#148;) will also transact insurance as a property and casualty insurer during 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

We seek opportunities to enter the property and casualty insurance market and establish our presence in other states. HCPCI has been approved to underwrite excess and surplus lines insurance products in Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Virginia. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HCPCI has not written an excess and surplus lines policy in any of these states. We also have one Alabama domiciled insurance subsidiary, Homeowners Choice Assurance Company, Inc., which has not written any policies as of the filing date of this report. 

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive markets where we face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies. We believe that we have approximately 19 significant competitors writing homeowners&#146; property and casualty insurance in the state of Florida. Based on September 30, 2015 annualized premiums written data from the FLOIR, we are the fifth largest provider of homeowners&#146; property and casualty insurance in the state. 

Our competitors may have larger financial capacities, greater resource availability, and more diversification in terms of insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies which market their products through agents, as well as companies which sell insurance directly to their customers. In addition, large national insurers may reenter the Florida homeowners&#146; property and casualty insurance market and they may have certain competitive advantages such as increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base, and reduced policy acquisition costs. We may also face competition from new or temporary entrants in our niche markets. In some cases, such entrants may, because of inexperience, desire for new business, or other reasons, price their insurance products below ours. This pricing pressure may lead to overall premium reductions across the Florida market. In fact, the FLOIR recently approved a rate decrease that was effective January 1, 2016 for our new and renewal homeowners multi-peril business. Rates for our homeowners multi-peril policies will have an average overall decrease in premiums of approximately five percent while condominiums and renters multi-peril policies will receive uniform rate decreases in premiums of two percent and eight percent, respectively. Based on our current book of business, we estimate the overall reduction in 2016 net income will range from $4,500,000 to $5,500,000 with an impact on gross premiums earned of approximately $14,000,000. 

Our competitive strategies focus on the following key areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Exceptional service &#150; We are committed to maintaining superior service to our policyholders and agents. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Claims settlement practices &#150; We focus on fair and timely settlement of policyholder claims. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Disciplined underwriting &#150; We analyze exposures and utilize available underwriting data to ensure policies meet our selective criteria. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; New product offerings &#150; In addition to our flood-endorsed policies and wind-only program, we may cross-sell additional insurance products to our existing policyholders in order to broaden our lines of business and product mix or identify other lines of insurance to offer. In 2016, we anticipate offering flood-only policies to Florida customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Effective and efficient use of technology &#150; We strive to add or improve technology that can effectively and efficiently enhance service to our policyholders and agents. 

&#160;

&#160; For instance, we currently use our internally developed application, Exzeo TM , to increase the efficiency of our claims processing and settlement. In addition to our traditional sales channels such as insurance agents and brokers, we plan to sell flood-only policies directly to Florida homeowners through our website and applications developed by us. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Geographical expansion &#150; We continue to seek opportunities to expand our business within the state of Florida and perhaps into other states to increase overall geographic diversification. Seasonality of Our Business 

Our insurance business is seasonal as hurricanes and tropical storms typically occur during the period from June 1 through November 30 each year. With our reinsurance treaty year effective on June 1 each year, any variation in the cost of our reinsurance, whether due to changes in reinsurance rates or changes in the total insured value of our policy base, will occur and be reflected in our financial results beginning June 1 each year.

Government Regulation 

We are subject to the laws and regulations in any state in which we conduct our insurance business. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to a wide variety of financial and non-financial matters including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; authorized lines of business; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capital and surplus requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval of allowable rates and forms; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval of reinsurance contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; investment parameters; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; underwriting limitations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; transactions with affiliates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; dividend limitations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; changes in control; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; market conduct. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Regulatory Uncertainty 

Certain states including Florida have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limits the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies. The Florida legislature continuously considers bills affecting the Florida residential property insurance market. Current law penalizes insurers for noncompliance with the insurance code, establishes a private cause of action relating to claims payment practices, extends the notice period applicable 

&#160;

to non-renewals of certain residential policies, prevents non-renewals and cancellation except for material misrepresentation and non-payment of premium and establishes procedures governing rate filings. Any changes in such laws and regulations could have a material, adverse effect on our operations or our ability to expand. 

State Licensure and Approval 

Most states, including Florida, require licensure and regulatory approval prior to the marketing of insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company&#146;s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, rates, and forms, the character of its officers and directors and other of its financial and non-financial aspects. The regulatory authorities may not allow entry into a new market by not granting a license. In addition, regulatory authorities may preclude or delay our entry into markets by disapproving or withholding approval of our product filings. 

Statutory Reporting and Examination 

All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners mandates that all insurance companies be examined once every five years. However, the FLOIR has the authority to conduct an examination whenever it is deemed appropriate. HCPCI&#146;s latest FLOIR financial examination related to the year ended December 31, 2010. 

Liability for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the total cost of (i) claims that have been incurred, but not yet paid (case reserves), (ii) claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (&#147;IBNR&#148;), and (iii) loss adjustment expenses (&#147;LAE&#148;) which are intended to cover the ultimate cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims. We base our estimates on various assumptions and actuarial data we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The process of estimating the liability is inherently subjective and is influenced by many variables such as past loss experience, current claim trends and the prevailing social, economic and legal environments. 

Significant time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss. Our liability for losses and LAE, which we believe represents the best estimate at a given point in time based on facts, circumstances and historical trends then known, may necessarily be adjusted to reflect additional facts that become available during the loss settlement period. 

For a discussion and summary of the activity in the liability for losses and LAE for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Note 11 &#151; &#147;Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses&#148; to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Loss Development 

Our liability for losses and LAE represent estimated costs ultimately required to settle all claims for a given period. The following table illustrates development of the estimated liability for losses and LAE for the years 2007 (inception) through 2015 (amounts in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenues from property and casualty insurance operations represented 93.2%, 96.1% and 95.0%, respectively, of total revenues of all operating segments. As a result, our property and casualty insurance operations are our only reportable operating segment. 

Reinsurance 

We have a Bermuda domiciled wholly owned reinsurance subsidiary, Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company Ltd. We selectively retain risk in Claddaugh, displacing the need for HCPCI to pay premiums to third party reinsurers. Claddaugh fully collateralizes its exposure to HCPCI by depositing funds into a trust account. Claddaugh also mitigates a portion of its risk through one retrocession contract. 

Other Operations 

Real Estate 

Our real estate operations consist of real properties we own, operations located at those owned properties and investments in three commercial development projects, two of which are at our own properties and managed through joint ventures. 

Properties Used in Operations 

Our owned real estate used in operations consists of our headquarters building in Tampa, Florida, and our secondary insurance operations site in Ocala, Florida. At our headquarters, we lease available space to non-affiliates at various terms. The Ocala location, in addition to day-to-day operational use, serves as our alternative site in the event we experience any significant disruption at our headquarters building. 

Operations at Investment Properties 

Our investment properties consist of a combined 24 acres of waterfront and land and include one full-service restaurant and two marinas. The combined marina facilities offer to the general public: a) one dry-stack boat storage facility with capacity for approximately 305 boats; b) approximately 64 wet slips; c) two fuel facilities; and d) open areas for parking and storage. Dry-stack boat storage space is generally rented on a monthly or annual basis while the wet slips are rented on a daily or monthly basis. We acquired the restaurant and marina operations in connection with our purchase of those properties and we continue to operate them to enhance the property values. We also lease available space to non-affiliates at one of these locations. 

Investment Projects 

We have one ongoing real estate development and construction project in which our involvement is through an acquisition, development and construction loan arrangement (&#147;ADC Arrangement&#148;). Under the ADC Arrangement, we financed the acquisition, development and construction of a retail shopping center. Greenleaf Capital, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, has an option to purchase the property when the construction project is completed contingent upon tenant rental commitments for at least 90% of rentable space being secured by the developer. 

&#160;

We also have two real estate development projects through joint venture arrangements, one in which we have a 90% non-controlling equity interest and another which we consolidate with our operations. We believe these opportunities will enable us to grow our real estate portfolio and diversify our future sources of income. See Note 4 &#151; &#147;Investments&#148; to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Information Technology 

Our information technology operations include a team of experienced software developers with extensive knowledge in developing web-based products and applications for mobile devices. The operations, which are in Noida, India and in Tampa, Florida, are focused on developing cloud-based, innovative products or services that can be marketed to the public in addition to providing affiliates with back-office technology support services designed to facilitate and improve our ongoing operations. Some of the technologies originally developed in-house for our own insurance operations have been launched for use by third parties. These products include the following: 

Exzeo TM 

Exzeo is a cloud-based application available at Exzeo.com that provides automation and intelligence across multiple business processes. The product offers a highly customizable environment for businesses to integrate existing applications and develop new ones to address their unique business needs. 

Proplet TM 

We introduced to a selected group of independent insurance agents our new web-based tool called Proplet . Agents can search a property&#146;s insurance-related information such as wind mitigation reports, inspection reports, claims activity reports or flood zone areas by name, by address or by dropping a pin on a specific location on a map interface. In addition, agents can obtain an instant insurance quote from HCPCI through the use of Proplet . We plan to improve this technology continually as part of our commitment to exceptional service to policyholders and agents. 

Atlas Viewer TM 

Atlas Viewer is our interactive cloud-based data mapping and visualization application. Atlas Viewer allows users to upload, view and securely share data feeds on a customized map. Atlas Viewer , an industry agnostic data visualization product, allows users to combine data from multiple sources and leverage location coordinates to make more informed business decisions. Atlas Viewer is offered as a subscription-based service.
