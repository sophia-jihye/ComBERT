The Company filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on August 23, 2011, and focused its efforts to identify a possible business combination. 

&#160;

On November 20, 2015, the Company&#8217;s former majority shareholder and chief executive offer, Locksley Samuels (&#8220;Seller&#8221;), completed a private common stock purchase agreement (the &#8220;SPA&#8221;) to sell his entire 21,600,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to Shining Glory Investments Limited (&#8220;Purchaser&#8221;). In connection with the SPA, the Board appointed Ms. Doris Zhou as the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and director on November 20, 2015, and Seller concurrently resigned from all positions with the Company. As a result of the SPA, a change in control occurred as (i) Purchaser acquired approximately 65.45% of the Company&#8217;s common stock, and (ii) the Company&#8217;s sole officer and director after the SPA is Ms. Zhou.

On November 30, 2015, the Company&#8217;s board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and the majority of its shareholders approved that (i) the Company change its name from &#8220;Cambridge Projects Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Ionix Technology, Inc.&#8221;, (ii) the Company voluntarily changed its ticker symbol in connection with the name change, and (iii) the Company execute a 3:1 forward stock split, which will increase the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 33,001,000 to 99,003,000 (the &#8220;Corporate Actions). The Company filed an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) to effectuate the Corporate Actions and filed a Form 8-K on December 10, 2015, in regards to the Corporate Actions. On February 3, 2016, FINRA approved the Corporate Actions, which took effect on the market on February 4, 2016. As a result, (i) the Company&#8217;s name is now &#8220;Ionix Technology, Inc.&#8221;, (ii) its new trading symbol is &#8220;IINX&#8221;, (iii) the 3:1 forward stock split is effective, payable upon surrender, and (iv) the Company&#8217;s new CUSIP number is 46222Q107.

&#160;

On February 17, 2016, the Board ratified, approved, and authorized the Company&#8217;s acquisition of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Well Best International Investment Limited, a limited liability company formed under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (&#8220;Well Best&#8221;) on September 14, 2015. Well Best was acquired by Qingchun Yang, its current director, on November 10, 2015. One hundred percent interest in Well Best was transferred to Ionix Technology on February 15, 2016. Well Best&#8217;s purpose is to (i) act as an investment holding company and hold the assets of Taizhou Ionix Technology Company Limited (as explained below), and (ii) pursue new business ventures conducted in the Asia Pacific region excluding China. &#160; Well Best has had no activities since inception. 

&#160;

On February 17, 2016, the Board ratified, approved, and authorized the Company, as the sole member of Well Best, on the formation of Taizhou Ionix Technology Company Limited (&#8220;Taizhou Ionix&#8221;), a company formed under the laws of China on December 17, 2015, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Well Best. Taizhou Ionix conducted no business between its date of incorporation and date approved by the Board. As a result, Taizhou Ionix is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Taizhou Ionix was formed to (i) develop, design, and manufacture lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, and (ii) act as an investment holding company that may acquire other businesses located in China.

On August 19, 2016, Well Best, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a share transfer agreement (the &#8220;Share Transfer Agreement&#8221;) whereby Well Best sold 100% of its equity interest in Taizhou Ionix, to Mr. GuoEn Li, the sole director and officer of Taizhou for &#160; approximately 30,000 Chinese Yuan ($5,000USD) (the &#8220;Sale&#8221;). Well Best was the sole shareholder of Taizhou. The Board approved and authorized the Sale, and instructed Well Best to enter into and execute the Share Transfer Agreement due to the fact that the Company believed that Taizhou&#8217;s manufacturing contract with Taizhou Jiunuojie Electronic Technology Limited to produce lithium batteries was not beneficial to the Company. As a result of the Sale, (i) Taizhou is no longer an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) Mr. Li is no longer affiliated with the Company. The Share Transfer Agreement was filed as exhibit 10.2 to the Company&#8217;s current report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on August 24, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

On August 19, 2016, the Board ratified, approved, and authorized the Company, as the sole member of Well Best, on the formation of Xinyu Ionix Technology Company Limited (&#8220;Xinyu Ionix&#8221;), a company formed under the laws of China on May 19, 2016.

What is a Lithium-Ion Battery?

A lithium-ion battery (&#8220;LIB&#8221;) is a rechargeable electric device within which lithium moves from a negative electrode to a positive electrode during the discharge and back charging. The four main materials typically used in LIB&#8217;s are cathode materials, anode materials, operators, and electrolytic solution. The performance and safety of an LIB depends heavily on the materials from which they are made as their operation is based on chemical reactions which can be directly affected by the materials used in production. 

LIB&#8217;s are one of the most common types of rechargeable batteries as they are frequently used as the power supply for most consumer devices that people use every day such as mobile phones, digital cameras, and power tools. Additionally, LIB&#8217;s are also utilized in aerospace applications and automotive products such as electric and hybrid vehicles. The lithium-ion battery has become the more sought-after alternative to nickel-metal batteries for electric vehicles , partially due to its lighter weight and smaller size, and LIB&#8217;s have become a common replacement for the lead acid batteries used in golf carts and utility vehicles. 

Industry Overview

The first lithium-ion battery was commercialized by Japan&#8217;s Sony in 1991. Since then, the LIB has become the most popular and advanced battery with its reach expanding more and more every day. Lithium-ion batteries are used in and influence nearly every aspect of our lives daily, both at home and at work, and innovation is sprinting forward at a rapid pace. The push for clean and renewable energy, from wind power to solar power, is a driving force in business today and a major reason why Lithium-batteries are and have been a major contender in storing renewable energy.

The global market for lithium-ion batteries has grown significantly and is expected to continue to grow as the need for high power and high capacity battery cells increase its penetration into broader forms of use. The power density, safety, recharge time, cost, and other aspects of its technology are expected to continue to improve with future developments in technology.

&#160;

&#160;

According to a report published by Allied Market Research titled, "Lithium-Ion Battery Market" the global lithium-ion battery market is expected to generate revenue of $46.21 billion by 2022, with a CAGR of 10.8% during the forecast period (2016-2022). 1 As reported by Allied, the market for these batteries is expected to experience significant growth because of their increasing application in the automotive sector. Other key factors that may affect the growth of this market are the growing demand for smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices; stringent government regulations aimed at reducing the increasing pollution levels; and enhanced efficiency of lithium-ion batteries. 

Currently, the electronics industry has the highest demand for lithium-ion batteries, however, the automotive sector is forecast to have the highest rising demand for LIB for use in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The number of electric/hybrid vehicles is expected to increase at an exponential rate in the coming years, which would further increase the demand for lithium ion batteries. For instance, in 2014, Tesla announced its plans to manufacture around 500,000 electric cars every year by around 2018, which would require a huge supply of lithium ion batteries.

The Asia-Pacific geographical region is currently the largest in LIB use and production due to burgeoning demand in China, Japan and India. North America and Europe are the second and third leading regions respectively, for lithium-ion battery market. 2 Currently, the global market is highly concentrated as about 5 to 6 major players occupy around 50% market share in the overall lithium-ion battery market. 3 &#160;
