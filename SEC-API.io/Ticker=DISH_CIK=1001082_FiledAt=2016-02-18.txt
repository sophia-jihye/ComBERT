 Item 1. BUSINES S 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

DISH Network Corporation was organized in 1995 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada. We started offering the DISH &#174; branded pay-TV service in March 1996 and are the nation&#8217;s third largest pay-TV provider. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;DISH.&#8221; Our principal executive offices are located at 9601 South Meridian Boulevard, Englewood, Colorado 80112 and our telephone number is (303) 723-1000. 

&#160; 

DISH Network Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries (which together with DISH Network Corporation are referred to as &#8220;DISH Network,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and/or &#8220;our,&#8221; unless otherwise required by the context) operate two primary business segments. 

&#160; 

DISH 

&#160; 

We offer pay-TV services under the DISH &#174; brand and the Sling &#174; brand (collectively &#8220;Pay-TV&#8221; services). The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite (&#8220;DBS&#8221;) and Fixed Satellite Service (&#8220;FSS&#8221;) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, third-party broadcast operations, customer service facilities, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations. The Sling branded pay-TV services consist of, among other things, live, linear streaming over-the-top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) Internet-based domestic, international and Latino video programming services (&#8220;Sling TV&#8221;). Prior to 2015, we launched our Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld) , which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers. During 2015, we launched our Sling dom estic and Sling Latino services. &#160; &#160; All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count. As of December 31, 2015, we had 13.897 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States. 

&#160; 

In addition, we market broadband services under the dishNET&#8482; brand, which had 0.623 million subscribers in the United States as of December 31, 2015. Our satellite broadband service utilizes advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Hughes&#8221;) and ViaSat, Inc. (&#8220;ViaSat&#8221;) to provide broadband coverage nationwide. This service primarily targets rural residents that are underserved, or unserved, by wireline broadband. In addition to the dishNET branded satellite broadband service, we also offer wireline voice and broadband services under the dishNET brand as a competitive local exchange carrier to consumers living in a 14-state region in the western United States. We primarily bundle our dishNET branded services with our DISH branded pay-TV service. 

&#160; 

Wireless 

&#160; 

DISH Network Spectrum 

&#160; 

We have invested over $5.0 billion since 2008 to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets. These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. As we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we may incur significant additional expenses and may have to make significant inves tm ents related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure, as well as the acquisition of additional wireless spectrum. For example, on February 10, 2016, we filed an application with the FCC to potentially participate as a bidder in the upcoming broadcast television spectrum incentive auction (&#8220;A uction 1000&#8221;). Auction 1000 is scheduled to begin on March 29, 2016. The FCC determined that bidding in Auction 1000 will be &#8220;anonymous,&#8221; which means that prior to and during the course of the auction, the FCC will not make public any information about a specific applicant&#8217;s upfront deposits or its bids. In addition, FCC rules restrict information that bidders may disclose about their participation in Auction 1000. See Note 15 &#8220; Commitments and Contingencies &#8212; Wireless &#8212; DISH Network Spectrum &#8221; in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses 

&#160; 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. (&#8220;American II&#8221;) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. (&#8220;American III&#8221;), we have made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, LLC (&#8220;Northstar Spectrum&#8221;), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, LLC (&#8220;Northstar Wireless,&#8221; and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the &#8220;Northstar Entities&#8221;), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC (&#8220;SNR HoldCo&#8221;), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC (&#8220;SNR Wireless,&#8221; and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the &#8220;SNR Entities&#8221;), respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the &#8220;AWS-3 Licenses &#8221;) to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in &#8220;FCC authorizations&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the applicable accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidation (&#8220;ASC 810&#8221;), Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we have consolidated these entities into our financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

&#160; 

The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. We may need to make significant additional loans to the Northstar Entities and to the SNR Entities, or they may need to partner with others, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, and comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses. Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such loans or partnerships could vary significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities. 

&#160; 

See Note 15 &#8220; Commitments and Contingencies &#8212; Wireless &#8212; DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses &#8221; in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value. We promote DISH branded programming packages as providing our subscribers with a better &#8220;price-to-value&#8221; relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers. We believe that there continues to be unsatisfied demand for high-quality, reasonably priced subscription television services. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Products with the Best Technology. We offer a wide selection of local and national high-definition (&#8220;HD&#8221;) programming and are a technology leader in our industry, offering award-winning DVRs (including our Hopper &#174; whole-home HD DVR), multiple tuner receivers, 1080p video on demand, and external hard drives. In addition, during 2015, we launched our Sling domestic and Sling Latino services. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Outstanding Customer Service. We strive to provide outstanding customer service by improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the reliability of our equipment, better educating our customers about our products and services, and resolving customer problems promptly and effectively when they arise. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Great Value. We have historically been viewed as the low-cost provider in the pay-TV industry in the U.S. because we seek to offer the lowest everyday prices available to consumers after introductory promotions expire. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Pay-TV Programming. We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription. Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national broadcast networks, local broadcast networks and national and regional cable networks. We also offer programming packages that include regional and specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming. Our Latino and international programming packages allow subscribers to choose from over 250 channels in 28 languages. 

&#160; 

In addition, we offer our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers streaming access through DISH On Demand &#174; to more than 10,000 movies and TV shows via their TV or Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers. 

&#160; 

Our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers also have the ability to use dishanywhere.com and our mobile applications for smartphones and tablets to view authorized content, search program listings and remotely control certain features of their DVRs. Dishanywhere.com and our mobile applications provide access to thousands of movies and television shows. 

&#160; 

Sling branded pay-TV services. We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services. Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on certain streaming -capable devices including TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and smart phones. Prior to 2015, we launched our Sling International video programming service (formerly known as DishWorld), which historically represented a small percentage of our Pay-TV subscribers. Sling International now offers over 200 channels in 18 languages. In February 2015, we launched our Sling domestic service. The Sling domestic core package consists of over 20 channels offered for a $20 monthly subscription. In addition to the core programming package, Sling domestic offers additional tiers of programming, including sports, kids, movies, world news, lifestyle and spanish language and additional premium content such as HBO, each available for an additional monthly fee. Sling TV programming is offered live and on-demand and can be replayed as programming rights permit. On June 4, 2015, we also launched our Sling Latino service. All Sling TV subscribers are included in our Pay-TV subscriber count. 

&#160; 

Technology. Our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers receive programming via equipment that includes a small satellite dish, digital set-top receivers, and remote controls. Our Hopper and Joey &#174; whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere. It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers. During the first quarter 2016, we made our next generation Hopper, the Hopper 3, available to customers nationwide. Among other things, the Hopper 3 features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously. 

&#160; 

We rely on EchoStar Corporation (&#8220;EchoStar&#8221;) to design and manufacture substantially all of our new receivers and certain related components. See &#8220; Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors .&#8221; 

&#160; 

Broadband. In addition to our wide selection of pay-TV programming and award-winning technology, we market a satellite broadband service under the dishNET brand. This service leverages advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes and ViaSat to provide broadband coverage nationwide. This service primarily targets rural residents that are underserved, or unserved, by wireline broadband, and provides download speeds of up to 15 megabits of data per second (&#8220;Mbps&#8221;). We lease the customer premise equipment to subscribers and generally pay Hughes and ViaSat a wholesale rate per subscriber on a monthly basis. Currently, we generally utilize our existing DISH distribution channels, including our DISH direct sales channels, under similar incentive arrangements as our DISH branded pay-TV business to acquire new broadband subscribers. 

&#160; 

In addition to the dishNET branded satellite broadband service, we also offer wireline voice and broadband services under the dishNET brand as a competitive local exchange carrier to consumers living in a 14-state region (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming). Our dishNET branded wireline broadband service provides download speeds of up to 40 Mbps. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We primarily bundle our dishNET branded services with our DISH branded pay-TV service, to offer customers a single bill, payment and customer service option, which includes a discount for bundled services. In addition, we market and sell our dishNET branded services on a stand-alone basis. 

&#160; 

New Business Opportunities 

&#160; 

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities, improve or sustain our competitive position, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. 

&#160; 

Content Delivery 

&#160; 

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers. The principal digital broadcast operations facilities that we use are EchoStar&#8217;s facilities located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona. We also use seven regional digital broadcast operations facilities owned and operated by EchoStar that allow us to maximize the use of the spot beam capabilities of certain satellites. Programming content is delivered to these facilities by fiber or satellite and processed, compressed, encrypted and then uplinked to satellites for delivery to consumers. EchoStar provides certain broadcast services to us, including teleport services such as transmission and downlinking, channel origination services, and channel management services pursuant to a broadcast agreement that expires on December 31, 2016. See Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar. 

&#160; 

Satellites. Our DISH branded pay-TV programming is primarily delivered to customers using satellites that operate in the &#8220;Ku&#8221; band portion of the microwave radio spectrum. The Ku-band is divided into two spectrum segments. The portion of the Ku-band that allows the use of higher power satellites (12.2 to 12.7 GHz over the United States) is known as the Broadcast Satellite Service band, which is also referred to as the DBS band. The portion of the Ku-band that utilizes lower power satellites (11.7 to 12.2 GHz over the United States) is known as the FSS band. 

&#160; 

Most of our DISH branded pay-TV programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites. To accommodate more bandwidth-intensive HD programming and other needs, we continue to explore opportunities to expand our satellite capacity through the acquisition of additional spectrum, the launching of more technologically advanced satellites, and the more efficient use of existing spectrum via, among other things, better compression technologies. 

&#160; 

We own or lease capacity on 12 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator. For further information concerning these satellites and satellite anomalies, please see the table and discussion under &#8220;Satellites&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

Conditional Access System . Our conditional access system secures our programming content using encryption so that only authorized customers can access our programming. We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called &#8220;smart cards,&#8221; or security chips in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content (&#8220;Security Access Devices&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult. It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft. We expect that future replacements of our Security Access Devices will be necessary to keep our system secure. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system&#8217;s security is compromised. 

&#160; 

Internet Connection. Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available through certain streaming-capable devices. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Distribution Channels 

&#160; 

While we offer receiver systems and programming through direct sales channels, a significant percentage of our gross new subscriber activations are generated through independent third parties such as small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies. In general, we pay these independent third parties a mix of upfront and monthly incentives to solicit orders for our services and provide customer service. In addition, we partner with certain telecommunications companies to bundle DISH branded programming with broadband and/or voice services on a single bill. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 13.897 million P ay-TV subscribers, representing approximately 14% of pay-TV subscribers in the United States, and 0.623 million broadband subscribers. We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and mobile devices. As of September 30, 2015, roughly 100 million U.S. households subscribe to a pay-TV service. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Other Direct Broadcast Satellite Operators . We compete directly with DirecTV, the largest satellite TV provider in the U.S., which was acquired by AT&#38;T Inc. (&#8220;AT&#38;T&#8221;) in July 2015 and had 19.6 million subscribers as of September 30, 2015, representing approximately 20% of pay-TV subscribers. As a result of this acquisition, DirecTV, among other things, has increased access to capital, access to AT&#38;T&#8217;s nationwide platform for wireless mobile video, and the ability to more seamlessly bundle its video services with AT&#38;T&#8217;s broadband Internet access and wireless services. The combined company also may be able to, among other things, pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us; utilize its increased leverage over third-party content owners and programmers to reduce the price it pays for programming at the expense of other multichannel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;), including us; thwart our entry into the wireless market, by, among other things, refusing to enter into data roaming agreements with us; underutilize key orbital spectrum resources that could be more efficiently used by us; foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; and impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Cable Television Companies. We encounter substantial competition in the pay-TV industry from numerous cable television companies that operate via franchise licenses across the U.S. As of September 30, 2015, cable television companies have more than 53.0 million subscribers, representing approximately 54% of pay-TV subscribers. Cable companies are typically able to bundle their video services with broadband Internet access and voice services and many have significant investments in companies that provide programming content. During May 2015, Charter Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Charter&#8221;) announced its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. (&#8220;Time Warner Cable&#8221;) and Bright House Networks (collectively &#8220;New Charter&#8221;), which would create the second largest cable television provider and third largest MPVD in the U.S. This acquisition is currently undergoing regulatory review and has not been completed. The proposed transaction, if ultimately completed, will create a duopoly, resulting in two broadband providers, New Charter and Comcast Corporation (&#8220;Comcast&#8221;) , controlling about 90% of the nation&#8217;s high-speed broadband homes between them. In addition, the impact of New Charter would cause a significant proportion of the combined company&#8217;s high-speed broadband subscribers to lack access to alternative high-speed broadband options. Further, if the proposed transaction ultimately is completed, New Charter would be able to, among other things, foreclose or degrade our online video offerings at various points in the broadband pipe; impose data caps on consumers who access our online video offerings; and pressure third-party content owners and programmers to withhold online rights from us and raise other MVPDs&#8217; third-party programming costs, including us. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Telecommunications Companies . Large telecommunications companies have upgraded older copper wire lines with fiber optic lines in certain markets. These fiber optic lines provide high capacity bandwidth, enabling telecommunications companies to offer video content that can be bundled with their broadband Internet access and wireless services. In particular, AT&#38;T and Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) have built fiber-optic based networks to provide video services in substantial portions of their service areas. As of September 30, 2015, AT&#38;T and Verizon had approximately 5.9 million U-verse and 5.8 million FiOS TV subscribers, respectively. These telecommunications companies represent approximately 12% of pay-TV subscribers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Internet Delivered Video. We face competition from content providers and other companies including, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Google and Verizon , who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet . In addition, p rogramming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices. Significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which consumers obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business. In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Wireless Mobile Video. We may also face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings. These mobile video offerings will likely become more prevalent in the marketplace as wireless telecommunications providers expand the fourth generation of wireless communications. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Small and Rural Telephone Companies and Google Fiber. Other telephone companies are also finding ways to deliver video programming services over their wireline facilities or in a bundle with other MVPD providers. For example, DirecTV has agreements with CenturyLink, Exede, Cincinnati Bell, HughesNet, Windstream, Verizon and Mediacom to bundle their individual DSL or satellite broadband and telephony services with DirecTV&#8217;s video service. Google has also deployed its own fiber network in the Kansas City metro area, Provo, Utah as well as Austin, Texas, with speeds up to one gigabit. Google has announced plans to deploy fiber networks in additional metro areas across the country. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of New Subscribers 

&#160; 

We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, retailer incentives, equipment, installation services and new customer promotions. Certain customer promotions to acquire new subscribers result in less programming revenue to us over the promotional period. While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscriptions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. With respect to our DISH branded pay-TV service, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments. We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their pay-TV service over longer periods of time. Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period. 

&#160; 

Advertising . We use print, radio, television and Internet media, on a local and national basis to motivate potential subscribers to contact DISH and Sling, visit our websites or contact independent third-party retailers. 

&#160; 

Retailer Incentives. In general, we pay independent retailers an upfront incentive for each new DISH branded pay-TV subscriber they bring to DISH that results in the activation of qualified programming and generally pay independent retailers small monthly incentives for up to 60 months; provided, among other things: (i) the retailer continuously markets, promotes and solicits orders for DISH products and services; (ii) the retailer continuously provides customer service to our DISH branded pay-TV subscribers; and (iii) the customer continuously subscribes to qualified programming. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Equipment . We incur significant upfront costs to provide our new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers with in-home equipment, including advanced HD and DVR receivers, which most of our new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers lease from us. While we seek to recoup these upfront equipment costs mostly through monthly fees, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective. In addition, upon deactivation of a subscriber we may refurbish and redeploy their equipment which lowers future upfront costs. However, our ability to capitalize on these cost savings may be limited as technological advances and consumer demand for new features may render the returned equipment obsolete. 

&#160; 

Installation Services. We incur significant upfront costs to install satellite dishes and receivers in the homes of our new DISH branded pay-TV subscribers. 

&#160; 

New Customer Promotions. We often offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing during introductory periods for new subscribers. While such promotional activities have an economic cost and reduce our subscriber-related revenue, they are not included in our definitions of subscriber acquisition costs or the Pay-TV SAC metric. 

&#160; 

Customer Retention 

&#160; 

We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH branded pay-TV customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits. As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services. In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term. A component of our retention efforts includes the re-installation of equipment for customers who move. Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period. 

&#160; 

Customer Service 

&#160; 

Customer Service Centers . We use both internally-operated and outsourced customer service centers to handle calls from prospective and existing customers. We strive to answer customer calls promptly and to resolve issues effectively on the first call. We also use the Internet and other applications to provide our customers with self-service capabilities. 

&#160; 

Installation and Other In-Home Service Operations . High - quality installations, upgrades, and in-home repairs are critical to providing DISH branded pay-TV subscribers quality customer service. Such in-home service is performed by both DISH Network employees and a network of independent contractors and includes, among other things, priority technical support, replacement equipment, cabling and power surge repairs. 

&#160; 

Subscriber Management . We presently use, and depend on, software systems for subscriber billing and related functions , including, among others, CSG Systems International, Inc.&#8217;s software system used for the DISH branded pay-TV and broadband service s . 

&#160; 

Relationship with EchoStar 

&#160; 

On January 1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the &#8220;Spin-off&#8221;) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar. DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies and, except for the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction and Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (&#8220;Sling TV Holding&#8221;) discussed in Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, neither entity has any ownership interest in the other. However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. EchoStar is our primary supplier of digital set-top boxes and digital broadcast operations. In addition, EchoStar provides the vast majority of our transponder capacity, is a key supplier of related services to us, and provides the streaming delivery technology and infrastructure for our Sling TV services. Furthermore, Hughes, a subsidiary of EchoStar, provides us with satellite broadband Internet service s on a wholesale basis , which we then distribute under our dishNET&#8482; brand. See &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160; 

On April 26, 2011, we completed the acquisition of most of the assets of Blockbuster, Inc. As of December 31, 2013, Blockbuster had ceased material operations. The results of Blockbuster are presented for all periods as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. On January 14, 2014, we completed the sale of our Blockbuster operations in Mexico. 

&#160; 

SATELLITES 

&#160; 

Pay-TV Satellites . Most of our DISH branded pay-TV programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites. We continue to explore opportunities to expand our available satellite capacity through the use of other available spectrum. Increasing our available spectrum is particularly important as more bandwidth intensive HD programming is produced and to address new video and data applications consumers may desire in the future. We currently utilize satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator detailed in the table below.

See Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar.

On February 20, 2014, we entered into the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction with EchoStar pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred these satellites to EchoStar and lease back all available capacity on these satellites. See Note 6 and Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 

(3) 

We generally have the option to renew each lease on a year-to-year basis through the end of the useful life of the respective satellite. 

(4) 

We have the option to renew this lease for an additional six-year period. If we exercise our six-year renewal option, we have the option to renew this lease for an additional five years.

Satellites Under Construction 

&#160; 

EchoStar XVIII . On September 7, 2012, we entered into a contract with Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (&#8220;SS/L&#8221;) for the construction of EchoStar XVIII, a DBS satellite with spot beam technology designed for, among other things, HD programming. During October 2013, we entered into an agreement with ArianeSpace S.A. (&#8220;Ariane&#8221;) for launch services for this satellite, which is expected to launch during the second quarter 2016. 

&#160; 

Satellite Anomalies 

&#160; 

Operation of our DISH branded pay-TV service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer. Moreover, current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming. While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited. 

&#160; 

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our &#160; owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite. Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

In the past, certain of our owned and leased satellites have experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful life and/or commercial operation. There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not impact the remaining useful life and/or commercial operation of any of the owned and leased satellites in our fleet. See &#8220;Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&#8221; in Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on evaluation of impairment. There can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our owned or leased in-orbit satellites were to fail. We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the owned or leased satellites that we use, other than certain satellites leased from third parties, and therefore, we will bear the risk associated with any uninsured in-orbit satellite failures. In light of current favorable market conditions, during January 2016, we procured commercial launch and in-orbit insurance (for a period of one year following launch) for the EchoStar XVIII satellite, which is expected to launch during the second quarter 2016. 

&#160; 

AWS-4 Satellites. We own two in-orbit AWS-4 satellites (D1 and T1). See the table below for further information.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 

&#160; 

Our operations, particularly our pay-TV and broadband operations, and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to significant government regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and foreign, state and local authorities. Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in limitations on, or the suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These governmental authorities could also adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Furthermore, the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to video programming, satellite services, wireless telecommunications, broadband, the Internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. If we become subject to new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation that govern Internet network neutrality, for example, we may be required to incur additional expenses or alter our business model. The manner in which legislation governing Internet network neutrality may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, including, among other things, regulations governing the licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal or revocation. There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed. Failure to comply with FCC requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area. For further information related to our licenses and build-out requirements related to our wireless spectrum licenses see &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation in the United States is not intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting the video programming distribution, satellite services, wireless telecommunications and broadband industries. Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, legislative hearings or administrative proposals could change these industries to varying degrees. We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or any potential impact they might have on these industries or on our operations. 

&#160; 

FCC Regulations Governing our Pay-TV Operations 

&#160; 

FCC Jurisdiction over our DBS Satellite Operations . The Communications Act of 1934 , as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;) , gives the FCC broad authority to regulate the operations of satellite companies. Specifically, the Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over the following areas relating to communications satellite operations: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations, the licensing of satellites and earth stations, the granting of related authorizations, and evaluation of the fitness of a company to be a licensee; 

&#183; 

approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations or the replacement of an existing satellite with a new satellite; 

&#183; 

ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of such assignments, licenses, authorizations and approvals, including required timetables for construction and operation of satellites; 

&#183; 

avoiding interference with other radio frequency emitters; and 

&#183; 

ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations. 

&#160; 

To obtain FCC satellite licenses and authorizations, satellite operators must satisfy strict legal, technical and financial qualification requirements. Once issued, these licenses and authorizations are subject to a number of conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of ongoing due diligence obligations, construction milestones, and various reporting requirements. Necessary federal approval of these applications may not be granted, may not be granted in a timely manner, or may be granted subject to conditions which may be cumbersome. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Overview of our DBS Satellites, Authorizations and Contractual Rights for Satellite Capacity . Our satellites are located in orbital positions, or slots, that are designated by their western longitude. An orbital position describes both a physical location and an assignment of spectrum in the applicable frequency band. Each DBS orbital position has 500 MHz of available Ku-band spectrum that is divided into 32 frequency channels. Several of our satellites also include spot-beam technology that enables us to increase the number of markets where we provide local channels, but reduces the number of video channels that could otherwise be offered across the entire United States. 

&#160; 

The FCC has licensed us to operate a total of 50 DBS frequency channels at the following orbital locations: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

21 DBS frequency channels at the 119 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to the continental United States (&#8220;CONUS&#8221;); and 

&#183; 

29 DBS frequency channels at the 110 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to CONUS. 

&#160; 

In addition, we currently lease or have entered into agreements to lease capacity on satellites using the following spectrum at the following orbital locations: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

500 MHz of Ku-band FSS spectrum that is divided into 32 frequency channels at the 118.7 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian FSS slot that is capable of providing service to CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii; 

&#183; 

32 DBS frequency channels at the 129 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian DBS slot that is capable of providing service to most of the United States; 

&#183; 

32 DBS frequency channels at the 61.5 degree orbital location, capable of providing service to most of the United States; 

&#183; 

24 DBS frequency channels at the 77 degree orbital location, which is a Mexican DBS slot that is capable of providing service to most of the United States and Mexico; and 

&#183; 

32 DBS frequency channels at the 72.7 degree orbital location, which is a Canadian DBS slot that is capable of providing service to CONUS. 

&#160; 

We also have month-to-month FSS capacity available from EchoStar on a satellite located at the 121 degree orbital location and a lease for FSS capacity available from EchoStar on a satellite located at the 103 degree orbital location. 

&#160; 

In June 2015, the FCC granted us authority to provide service to the United States from a Canadian-licensed satellite using Reverse Band Working DBS frequencies at the 103 degree orbital location. 

&#160; 

Duration of our DBS Satellite Licenses . Generally speaking, all of our satellite licenses are subject to expiration unless renewed by the FCC. The term of each of our DBS licenses is ten years. Our licenses are currently set to expire at various times. In addition, at various times we have relied on special temporary authorizations for our operations. A special temporary authorization is granted for a period of only 180 days or less, subject again to possible renewal by the FCC. From time to time, we apply for authorizations to use new satellites at our existing orbital locations. For example, in October 2014, we filed an application with the FCC to launch and operate a new satellite, EchoStar XVIII, at the 110 degree orbital location, which was granted in March 2015. Generally, our FCC licenses and special temporary authorizations have been renewed, and our applications for new satellites at our existing orbital locations have been approved, by the FCC on a routine basis, but there can be no assurance that the FCC will continue to do so. 

&#160; 

Opposition and Other Risks to our Licenses . Several third parties have opposed in the past, and we expect these or other parties to oppose in the future, some of our FCC satellite authorizations and pending and future requests to the FCC for extensions, modifications, waivers and approvals of our licenses. In addition, we must comply with numerous FCC reporting, filing and other requirements in connection with our satellite authorizations. Consequently, it is possible the FCC could revoke, terminate, condition or decline to extend or renew certain of our authorizations or licenses. 

&#160; 

4.5 Degree Spacing &#8220; Tweener &#8221; Satellites . The FCC has proposed to allow so-called &#8220;tweener&#8221; DBS operations &#8212; DBS satellites operating at orbital locations 4.5 degrees (half of the usual nine degrees) away from other DBS satellites. The FCC granted authorizations to EchoStar and Spectrum Five for tweener satellites at the 86.5 and 114.5 degree orbital locations , respectively . T hese authorizations were subsequently cancelled because the FCC determined that the licensees did not meet certain milestone requirements . Tweener operations close to our licensed orbital locations could cause harmful interference to our service and constrain our future operations. The FCC has not completed its rulemaking on the operating and service rules for tweener satellites. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Interference from Other Services Sharing Satellite Spectrum . The FCC has adopted rules that allow non-geostationary orbit fixed satellite services to operate on a co-primary basis in the same frequency band as DBS and FSS. The FCC has also authorized the use of multichannel video distribution and data service (&#8220;MVDDS&#8221;) licenses in the DBS band. MVDDS licenses were auctioned in 2004. MVDDS systems are now only beginning to be commercially deployed in a few markets. We have MVDDS licenses in 82 out of 214 geographical license areas. Despite regulatory provisions intended to protect DBS and FSS operations from harmful interference, there can be no assurance that operations by other satellites or terrestrial communication services in the DBS and FSS bands will not interfere with our DBS and FSS operations and adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Satellite Competition from Additional Slots and Interference . DirecTV has obtained FCC authority to provide service to the United States from a Canadian DBS orbital slot, and EchoStar has obtained authority to provide service to the United States from both a Mexican and a Canadian DBS orbital slot. Further, we have also received authority to do the same from a Canadian DBS orbital slot at 129 degrees and a Canadian FSS orbital slot at 118.7 degrees. The possibility that the FCC will allow service to the U.S. from additional foreign slots may permit additional competition against us from other satellite providers. It may also provide a means by which to increase our available satellite capacity in the United States. In addition, a number of administrations, such as Great Britain and the Netherlands, have requested authority to add orbital locations serving the U.S. close to our licensed slots. Such operations could cause harmful interference to our satellites and constrain our future operations. 

&#160; 

Rules Relating to Broadcast Services . The FCC imposes different rules for &#8220;subscription&#8221; and &#8220;broadcast&#8221; services. We believe that because we offer a subscription programming service, we are not subject to many of the regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees. However, we cannot be certain whether the FCC will find in the future that we must comply with regulatory obligations as a broadcast licensee, and certain parties have requested that we be treated as a broadcaster. If the FCC determines that we are a broadcast licensee, it could require us to comply with all regulatory obligations imposed upon broadcast licensees, which in certain respects are subject to more burdensome regulation than subscription television service providers. 

&#160; 

Public Interest Requirements . The FCC imposes certain public interest obligations on our DBS licenses. These obligations require us to set aside four percent of our channel capacity exclusively for noncommercial programming for which we must charge programmers below-cost rates and for which we may not impose additional charges on subscribers. The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (&#8220;STELA&#8221;) required the FCC to decrease this set-aside to 3.5 percent for satellite carriers who provide retransmission of state public affairs networks in 15 states and are otherwise qualified. The FCC, however, has not yet determined whether we qualify for this decrease in set-aside. The obligation to provide noncommercial programming may displace programming for which we could earn commercial rates and could adversely affect our financial results. We cannot be sure that, if the FCC were to review our methodology for processing public interest carriage requests, computing the channel capacity we must set aside or determining the rates that we charge public interest programmers, it would find them in compliance with the public interest requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Separate Security, Plug and Play . The STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (&#8220;STELAR&#8221;) ended the &#8220;integration ban&#8221; that required cable companies to separate security functionality from the other features of their set-top boxes and that required leased cable set-top boxes to include CableCARDs. The repeal of the integration ban became effective in December 2015. Set-top boxes used by DBS providers were not subject to this separate security requirement. STELAR required the FCC to establish a working group of technical experts to identify and report on downloadable security design options that are not unduly burdensome and that promote competition with respect to the availability of navigation devices. The working group released a report in August 2015, which declined to offer a consensus recommendation regarding downloadable security design options. However, we cannot predict whether the FCC will take further action regarding downloadable security. Also, the FCC adopted the so-called &#8220;plug and play&#8221; standard for compatibility between digital television sets and cable systems. That standard was developed through negotiations involving the cable and consumer electronics industries, but not the satellite television industry. The FCC&#8217;s adoption of the standard was accompanied by certain rules regarding copy protection measures that were applicable to us. We appealed the FCC&#8217;s decision regarding the copy protection measures to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (&#8220;D.C. Circuit&#8221;) and on January 15, 2013 the D.C. Circuit vacated the FCC&#8217;s decision. The FCC is also considering various proposals to establish two-way digital cable &#8220;plug and play&#8221; rules. That proceeding also asks about means to incorporate all pay-TV providers into its &#8220;plug and play&#8221; rules. The cable industry and consumer electronics companies have reached a &#8220;tru2way&#8221; commercial arrangement to resolve many of the outstanding issues in this docket. We cannot predict whether the FCC will impose rules on our DBS operations that are based on cable system architectures or the private cable/consumer electronics tru2way commercial arrangement. Complying with the separate security and other &#8220;plug and play&#8221; requirements would require potentially costly modifications to our set-top boxes and operations. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this FCC proceeding. 

&#160; 

In late January 2016, the FCC announced plans to initiate a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible new regulations that would generally require pay-TV providers, among others, to make their video services operate on any third-party device. Under the FCC&#8217;s proposal, consumers would have the choice of accessing cable and satellite programming through the pay-TV operator&#8217;s products and services, or through products and services offered by a third party. These regulations, if adopted, would have the potential to impose new costs on our DISH branded pay-TV business by, among other things, requiring us to deploy additional hardware or software to enable our DISH branded pay-TV service to operate with third-party devices. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt any new regulations as a result of this proposed rulemaking process or the timing or outcome of this proposed rulemaking &#160; process . 

&#160; 

Retransmission Consent . The Copyright Act generally gives satellite companies a statutory copyright license to retransmit local broadcast channels by satellite back into the market from which they originated, subject to obtaining the retransmission consent of local network stations that do not elect &#8220;must carry&#8221; status, as required by the Communications Act. If we fail to reach retransmission consent agreements with such broadcasters, we cannot carry their signals. This could have an adverse effect on our strategy to compete with cable and other satellite companies that provide local signals. While we have been able to reach retransmission consent agreements with most of these local network stations, from time to time there are stations with which we have not been able to reach an agreement. We cannot be sure that we will secure these agreements or that we will secure new agreements on acceptable terms, or at all, upon the expiration of our current retransmission consent agreements, some of which are short-term. In recent years, national broadcasters have used their ownership of certain local broadcast stations to require us to carry additional cable programming in exchange for retransmission consent of their local broadcast stations. These requirements may place constraints on available capacity on our satellites for other programming. Furthermore, the rates we are charged for retransmitting local channels have been increasing substantially and may exceed our ability to increase our prices to our customers. We may be unable to pass these increased programming costs on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the broadcast stations&#8217; demands for higher rates have resulted in more frequent negotiating impasses and programming interruptions. During these programming interruptions, our subscribers in the affected markets lack access to popular programming and may switch to another multichannel distributor that may be able to provide them with such programming. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The FCC is currently considering changes to its rules governing retransmission consent disputes that may provide more guidance to the negotiating parties on good-faith negotiation requirements and improve notice to consumers in advance of possible service disruptions. In addition, in 2015 the FCC commence d a rulemaking proceeding as required by STELAR to review its &#8220;totality of circumstances&#8221; test for ensuring that television stations and MVPDs negotiate retransmission consent agreements in &#8220;good faith.&#8221; STELAR also prohibits television stations from coordinating or engaging in joint retransmission consent negotiations with any other local television stations, unless the stations are &#8220;directly or indirectly under common de jure control,&#8221; expanding a previous FCC ruling prohibiting joint negotiations only among the top four stations in a market. In addition, STELAR prohibits a local television station from limiting an MVPD&#8217;s ability to carry other television signals that have been deemed by the FCC to be &#8220;significantly viewed&#8221; or to carry any other television signal the MVPD is otherwise entitled to carry under the Communications Act, unless such stations are &#8220;directly or indirectly under common de jure control&#8221; pursuant to FCC regulations. We cannot predict if the FCC&#8217;s actions or these new restrictions on broadcasters will result in more effective retransmission consent negotiations. 

&#160; 

Digital HD Carry-One, Carry-All Requirement . To provide any full-power local broadcast signal in any market, we are required to retransmit all qualifying broadcast signals in that market (&#8220;carry-one, carry-all&#8221; ), including the carriage of full-power broadcasters&#8217; HD signals in markets in which we elect to provide local channels in HD. The carriage of additional HD signals on our DISH branded pay-TV service could cause us to experience significant capacity constraints and prevent us from carrying additional popular national programs and/or carrying those national programs in HD. 

&#160; 

Distant Signals . Pursuant to STELA, we obtained a waiver of a court injunction that previously prevented us from retransmitting certain distant network signals under a statutory copyright license. Because of that waiver, we may provide distant network signals to eligible subscribers. To qualify for that waiver, we are required to provide local service in all 210 local markets in the U.S. on an ongoing basis. This condition poses a significant strain on our capacity. Moreover, we may lose that waiver if we are found to have failed to provide local service in any of the 210 local markets. If we lose the waiver, the injunction could be reinstated. Furthermore, depending on the severity of the failure, we may also be subject to other sanctions, which may include, among other things, damages. 

&#160; 

Cable Act and Program Access . We purchase a large percentage of our programming from cable-affiliated programmers. Pursuant to the Cable Act of 1992 (&#8220;Cable Act&#8221;), cable providers had been prohibited from entering into exclusive contracts with cable-affiliated programmers. The Cable Act directed that this prohibition expire after a certain period of time unless the FCC determined that the prohibition continued to be necessary. On October 5, 2012, the FCC allowed this prohibition to expire. While the FCC has issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking aimed at serving some of the same objectives as the prohibition, there can be no assurances that such protections will be adopted or be as effective as the prohibition if they are adopted. In the event this decision is reconsidered by the FCC or reviewed by a court of appeals, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any subsequent FCC decision. 

&#160; 

As a result of the expiration of this prohibition on exclusivity, we may be limited in our ability to obtain access at all, or on nondiscriminatory terms, to programming from programmers that are affiliated with cable system operators. In addition, any other changes in the Cable Act, and/or the FCC&#8217;s rules that implement the Cable Act, that currently limit the ability of cable-affiliated programmers to discriminate against competing businesses such as ours, could adversely affect our ability to acquire cable-affiliated programming at all or to acquire programming on nondiscriminatory terms. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the FCC had imposed program access conditions on certain cable companies as a result of mergers, consolidations or affiliations with programmers. The expiration of the exclusivity prohibition in the Cable Act triggered the termination of certain program access conditions that the FCC had imposed on Liberty Media Corporation (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;). In July 2012, similar program access conditions that had applied to Time Warner Cable expired as previously scheduled. These developments may adversely affect our ability to obtain Liberty&#8217;s and Time Warner Cable&#8217;s programming, or to obtain it on nondiscriminatory terms. In the case of certain types of programming affiliated with Comcast through its control of NBCUniversal Media, LLC (&#8220;NBCUniversal&#8221;), the prohibition on exclusivity will still apply until January 2018. During that time, we have the right to subject the terms of access to NBCUniversal&#8217;s programming to binding arbitration if we and the programmer cannot reach agreement on terms, subject to FCC review. There can be no assurance that this procedure will result in favorable terms for us . 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, affiliates of certain cable providers have denied us access to sports programming that they supply to their cable systems terrestrially, rather than by satellite. The FCC has held that new denials of such service are unfair if they have the purpose or effect of significantly hindering us from providing programming to consumers. However, we cannot be sure that we can prevail in a complaint related to such programming and gain access to it. Our continuing failure to access such programming could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete in regions serviced by these cable providers. 

&#160; 

MDU Exclusivity . The FCC has found that cable companies should not be permitted to have exclusive relationships with multiple dwelling units (e.g., apartment buildings). In May 2009, the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC&#8217;s decision. While the FCC requested comments in November 2007 on whether DBS and Private Cable Operators should be prohibited from having similar relationships with multiple dwelling units, it has yet to make a formal decision. If the cable exclusivity ban were to be extended to DBS providers, our ability to serve these types of buildings and communities would be adversely affected. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the FCC&#8217;s consideration of this proposal. 

&#160; 

Net Neutrality. During 2010, the FCC imposed rules of nondiscrimination and transparency upon wireline broadband providers. While this decision provides certain protection from discrimination by wireline broadband providers against our distribution of video content via the Internet, it may still permit wireline broadband providers to provide certain services over their wireline broadband network that are not subject to these requirements. The FCC&#8217;s net neutrality rules were challenged in Federal court. On January 14, 2014, the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC&#8217;s transparency rule, but vacated both the nondiscrimination and anti-blocking rules. On February 26, 2015, the FCC revised its net neutrality rules , &#160; relying primarily upon Title II of the Communications Act and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The new rules became effective on June 12, 2015. They apply to both fixed and mobile broadband service and generally prohibit discrimination, blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. These new rules have been challenged and appealed to the D.C. Circuit. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this appeal or of any subsequent challenges to the rules. Therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these rules and related proceedings on our ability to distribute our video content via the Internet. 

&#160; 

Comcast-NBCUniversal . In January 2011, the FCC and the Department of Justice approved a transaction between Comcast and General Electric Company (&#8220;General Electric&#8221;), pursuant to which they joined their programming properties, including NBC, Bravo and many others, in a venture, NBCUniversal, controlled by Comcast. During March 2013, Comcast completed the acquisition of substantially all of General Electric&#8217;s remaining interest in NBCUniversal. The FCC conditioned its approval on, among other things, Comcast complying with the terms of the FCC&#8217;s order on network neutrality (even if that order is vacated by judicial or legislative action) and Comcast licensing its affiliated content to us, other traditional pay-TV providers and certain providers of video services over the Internet on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, including, among others, price. If Comcast does not license its affiliated content to us on fair and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions, we can seek binding arbitration and continue to carry such content while the arbitration is pending. However, it is uncertain how these conditions may be interpreted and enforced by the FCC; therefore, we cannot predict the practical effect of these conditions. In addition, as these conditions expire in January 2018, we will not be able to rely on these protections beyond that date. 

&#160; 

Definition of MVPD. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the definition of an MVPD. Among other things, the FCC is considering whether the definition of an MVPD should apply to Internet-based streaming services, thus making such services subject to the same regulations as an MVPD. The FCC is also considering the appropriate treatment of purely Internet-based linear video programming services that cable operators and DBS providers offer in addition to their traditional video services. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this rulemaking process. 

&#160; 

&#160;

FCC Regulation of Wireless Spectrum 

&#160; 

DISH Network Spectrum 

&#160; 

700 MHz Licenses . In 2008, we paid $712 million to acquire certain 700 MHz E Block (&#8220;700 MHz&#8221;) wireless spectrum licenses, which were granted to us by the FCC in February 2009. At the time they were granted, these licenses were subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. On October 29, 2013, the FCC issued an order approving a voluntary industry solution to resolve certain interoperability issues affecting the lower 700 MHz spectrum band (the &#8220;Interoperability Solution Order&#8221;), which requires us to reduce power emissions on our 700 MHz licenses. As part of the Interoperability Solution Order, the FCC, among other things, approved our request to modify the original interim and final build-out requirements associated with our 700 MHz licenses so that by March 2017, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of our total E Block population (the &#8220;Modified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). The FCC also approved our request to modify the 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement so that by March 2021, we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least 70% of the population in each of our E Block license areas (the &#8220;Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). While the modifications to our 700 MHz licenses provide us additional time to complete the build-out requirements, the reduction in power emissions could have an adverse impact on our ability to fully utilize our 700 MHz licenses. If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020, and we could face the reduction of license area(s). If we fail to meet the Modified 700 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization may terminate for the geographic portion of each license in which we are not providing service. 

&#160; 

AWS-4 Licenses . On March 2, 2012, the FCC approved the transfer of 40 MHz of wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America, Inc. (&#8220;DBSD North America&#8221;) and TerreStar Networks, Inc. (&#8220;TerreStar&#8221;) to us. On March 9, 2012, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity of reorganized DBSD North America (the &#8220;DBSD Transaction&#8221;) and substantially all of the assets of TerreStar (the &#8220;TerreStar Transaction&#8221;), pursuant to which we acquired, among other things, certain satellite assets and wireless spectrum licenses held by DBSD North America and TerreStar. The total consideration to acquire the DBSD North America and TerreStar assets was approximately $2.860 billion. 

&#160; 

On February 15, 2013, the FCC issued an order, which became effective on March 7, 2013, modifying our licenses to expand our terrestrial operating authority with AWS-4 authority (&#8220;AWS-4&#8221;). That order imposed certain limitations on the use of a portion of this spectrum, including interference protections for other spectrum users and power and emission limits that we presently believe could render 5 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2005 MHz) effectively unusable for terrestrial services and limit our ability to fully utilize the remaining 15 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz) for terrestrial services. These limitations could, among other things, impact the ongoing development of technical standards associated with our wireless business, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our AWS-4 licenses. That order also mandated certain interim and final build-out requirements for the licenses. By March 2017, we must provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 40% of the aggregate population represented by all of the areas covered by the licenses (the &#8220;AWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). By March 2020, we were required to provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least 70% of the population in each area covered by an individual license (the &#8220;AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On December 20, 2013, the FCC issued a further order that, among other things, extended the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement by one year to March 2021 (the &#8220;Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). If we fail to meet the AWS-4 Interim Build-Out Requirement, the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by one year, from March 2021 to March 2020. If we fail to meet the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement, our terrestrial authorization for each license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC&#8217;s December 20, 2013 order also conditionally waived certain FCC rules for our AWS-4 licenses to allow us to repurpose all 20 MHz of our uplink spectrum (2000-2020 MHz) for downlink (the &#8220;AWS-4 Downlink Waiver&#8221;). If we fail to notify the FCC that we intend to use our uplink spectrum for downlink by June 20, 2016, the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver will terminate, and the Modified AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement will revert back to the AWS-4 Final Build-Out Requirement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

H Block Licenses . On April 29, 2014, the FCC issued an order granting our application to acquire all 176 wireless spectrum licenses in the H Block auction. We paid approximately $1.672 billion to acquire these H Block licenses, including clearance costs associated with the lower H Block spectrum. The H Block licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By April 2018, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the &#8220;H Block Interim Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). By April 2024, we must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 75% of the population in each area covered by an individual H Block license (the &#8220;H Block Final Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). If we fail to meet the H Block Interim Build-Out Requirement, the H Block license term and the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by two years (from April 2024 to April 2022) for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement. If we fail to meet the H Block Final Build-Out Requirement, our authorization for each H Block license area in which we fail to meet the requirement may terminate. The FCC has adopted rules for the H Block spectrum band that is adjacent to our AWS-4 licenses. Depending on the outcome of the standard-setting process for the H Block and our ultimate decision regarding the AWS-4 Downlink Waiver, the rules that the FCC adopted for the H Block could further impact 15 MHz of our AWS-4 uplink spectrum (2005-2020 MHz), which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the AWS-4 licenses. 

&#160; 

DISH Network Non-Controlling Investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities Related to AWS-3 Wireless Spectrum Licenses 

&#160; 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American II and American III, we have made over $10.0 billion in certain non-controlling investments in Northstar Spectrum, the parent company of Northstar Wireless, and in SNR HoldCo, the parent company of SNR Wireless, respectively. On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 Licenses to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in &#8220;FCC authorizations&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements. By October 2021, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 40% of the population in each area covered by an individual AWS-3 License (the &#8220;AWS-3 Interim Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). By October 2027, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless must provide reliable signal coverage and offer service to at least 75% of the population in each area covered by an individual AWS-3 License (the &#8220;AWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement&#8221;). If Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless fails to meet the AWS-3 Interim Build-Out Requirement, the AWS-3 License term and the AWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement may be accelerated by two years (from October 2027 to October 2025) for each AWS-3 License area in which it fails to meet the requirement. If Northstar Wireless or SNR Wireless fails to meet the AWS-3 Final Build-Out Requirement, its authorization for each AWS-3 License area in which it fails to meet the requirement may terminate. 

&#160; 

See &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors - We face certain risks related to our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 

&#160; 

MVDDS . We have MVDDS licenses in 82 out of 214 geographical license areas, including Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago and several other major metropolitan areas. By August 2014, we were required to meet certain FCC build-out requirements related to our MVDDS licenses, and we are subject to certain FCC service rules applicable to these licenses. In January 2015, the FCC granted our application to extend the build-out requirements related to our MVDDS licenses. We now have until 2019 to provide &#8220;substantial service&#8221; on our MVDDS licenses, and the licenses expire in 2024. Our MVDDS licenses may be terminated, however, if we do not provide substantial service in accordance with the new build-out requirements. 

&#160; 

State and Local Regulation 

&#160; 

We are also regulated by state and local authorities. While the FCC has preempted many state and local regulations that impair the installation and use of towers and consumer satellite dishes, our business nonetheless may be subject to state and local regulation, including, among others, zoning regulations that affect the ability to install consumer satellite antennas or build out wireless telecommunications networks. 

&#160; 

&#160;

International Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to regulation by the International Telecommunication Union (&#8220;ITU&#8221;) and our satellites must be registered in the United Nations (&#8220;UN&#8221;) Registry of Space Objects. The orbital location and frequencies for certain of our satellites are subject to the frequency registration and coordination process of the ITU. The ITU Radio Regulations define the international rules, regulations, and rights for a satellite and associated earth stations to use specific radio frequencies at a specific orbital location. These rules, which include deadlines for the bringing of satellite networks into use, differ depending on the type of service to be provided and the frequencies to be used by the satellite. On our behalf, various countries have made and may in the future make additional filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire. 

&#160; 

Our satellite services also must conform to the ITU service plans for Region 2 (which includes the United States). If any of our operations are not consistent with this plan, the ITU will only provide authorization on a non-interference basis pending successful modification of the plan or the agreement of all affected administrations to the non-conforming operations. Certain of our satellites are not presently entitled to any interference protection from other satellites that are in conformance with the plan. Accordingly, unless and until the ITU modifies its service plans to include the technical parameters of our non-conforming operations, our non-conforming satellites, along with those of other non-conforming satellite operators, must not cause harmful electrical interference with other assignments that are in conformance with the ITU service plans. 

&#160; 

Registration in the UN Registry of Space Objects 

&#160; 

The United States and other jurisdictions in which we license satellites are parties to the UN Convention on the Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space. The UN Convention requires a satellite&#8217;s launching state to register the satellite as a space object. The act of registration carries liability for the registering country in the event that the satellite causes third-party damage. Administrations may place certain requirements on satellite licensees in order to procure the necessary launch or operational authorizations that accompany registration of the satellite. In some jurisdictions, these authorizations are separate and distinct, with unique requirements, from the authorization to use a set of frequencies to provide satellite services. There is no guarantee that we will be able to procure such authorizations even if we already possess a frequency authorization. 

&#160; 

Export Control Regulation 

&#160; 

The delivery of satellites and related technical information for purposes of launch by foreign launch service providers is subject to export control and prior approval requirements. We are required to obtain import and export licenses from the United States government to receive and deliver certain components of direct-to-home satellite television systems. In addition, the delivery of satellites and the supply of certain related ground control equipment, technical services and data, and satellite communication/control services to destinations outside the United States are subject to export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China). 

&#160; 

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

Many entities, including some of our competitors, have or may in the future obtain patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services that we offer or that we may offer in the future. In general, if a court determines that one or more of our products or services infringe intellectual property rights held by others, we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property rights at a material cost, or to redesign those products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing any patent claims. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we may be unable to obtain the intellectual property rights at any price, which could adversely affect our competitive position. 

&#160; 

We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights that our products or services may potentially infringe. In addition, patent applications in the United States are confidential until the Patent and Trademark Office either publishes the application or issues a patent (whichever arises first) and, accordingly, our products may infringe claims contained in pending patent applications of which we are not aware. Further, the process of determining definitively whether a claim of infringement is valid often involves expensive and protracted litigation, even if we are ultimately successful on the merits. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We cannot estimate the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual property licenses or the availability and cost of any such licenses. Those costs, and their impact on our results of operations, could be material. Damages in patent infringement cases can be substantial, and in certain circumstances can be trebled. To the extent that we are required to pay unanticipated royalties to third parties, these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our liquidity and operating results. We are currently defending multiple patent infringement actions. We cannot be certain the courts will conclude these companies do not own the rights they claim, that our products do not infringe on these rights and/or that these rights are not valid. Further, we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain licenses from these persons on commercially reasonable terms or, if we were unable to obtain such licenses, that we would be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 

&#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. We attempt to maintain compliance with all such requirements. We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in 2016 or 2017. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

We had approximately 18,000 employees at December 31, 2015, most of whom were located in the United States. We generally consider relations with our employees to be good. Approximately 60 employees in two of our field offices have voted to have a union represent them in contract negotiations. While we are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements, we are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements at these offices.
