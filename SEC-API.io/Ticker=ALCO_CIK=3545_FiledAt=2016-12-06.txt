Overview 

Alico is an agribusiness and natural resources management company, with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus, cattle and resource conservation. The Company owns approximately 122,000 &#32;acres of land in twelve Florida counties (Alachua, Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Martin, Osceola and Polk) including approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves, cattle ranching and conservation. 

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company acquired three Florida citrus properties for total consideration of approximately $363,000,000. These acquisitions make Alico one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America. 

Our mission is to create value for our customers and stockholders by managing existing lands to their optimal current income and total returns, opportunistically acquiring new agricultural assets and producing high quality agricultural products while exercising responsible environmental stewardship. 

We manage our land based upon its primary usage and review its performance based upon two primary classifications - Orange Co. &#32;and Conservation and Environmental Resources. In addition, Other Operations include lease income from an aggregates mine and leases of oil extraction rights to third parties among other insignificant lines of business. We present our financial results and the related discussion based upon our three business segments ( Orange Co. , Conservation and Environmental Resources, and Other Operations). 

Recent Developments 

Water Storage Contract Approval 

In December 2012, the South Florida Water Management District (&#8220;SFWMD&#8221; or "District") issued a solicitation request for projects to be considered for the Northern Everglades Payment for Environmental Services Program. The Company submitted its response proposing a dispersed water management project on a portion of its ranch land, and on December 11, 2014 the SFWMD approved a contract with the Company, and on September 29, 2015, the SFWMD amended the contract to extend it for an additional year. 

The contract term is eleven years, and allows up to one year for implementation (design, permitting, construction and construction completion certification) and ten years of operation whereby the Company will provide water retention services. Payment for these services includes an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 of reimbursement for implementation. In addition, it provides for an annual fixed payment of up to $12,000,000 for operations and maintenance costs as long as the project is in compliance with the contract. 

Annual payments under the contract are subject to the SFWMD receiving funds for the project from the Florida Legislature and SFWMD Governing Board budget appropriation. Funding for the first year of the dispersed water management project was included in the budget approved in the 2016 legislative session. 

Project permitting is in process and the Company intends to commence construction upon receipt of permits. Annual fixed payments will not commence until completion of construction. 

Change in Fiscal Year of Subsidiary 

As Alico, Inc. and 734 Citrus Holdings, LLC ("Silver Nip Citrus") were under common control at the time of the Merger (see Note 1. "Description of Business and Basis of Presentation" of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) it is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") to account for this common control acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the Company's Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 reflect Silver Nip Citrus&#8217; historical carryover basis in the assets and liabilities, instead of reflecting the fair market value of the assets and liabilities. Alico has also retrospectively recast its financial statements to combine the operating results of the Company and Silver Nip Citrus from the date common control began, November 19, 2013. 

Silver Nip Citrus&#8217; fiscal year end was June 30. Their financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were included in the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Effective October 1, 2015, the fiscal year end for Silver Nip Citrus was changed to September 30 to reflect that of the Company. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s financial condition as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 now includes the financial condition of Silver Nip Citrus as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company&#8217;s results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 now includes the Silver Nip Citrus results of operations for fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company&#8217;s results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 include the operating results of Silver Nip Citrus from the date common control began, November 19, 2013 through September 30, 2014. The impact of this change was not material to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, with an approximate $492,000 decrease in total assets and an approximate net loss of $596,000 for the transition period related to this change included in Stockholders' Equity at September 30, 2015. 

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Operating segments are defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") - Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company&#8217;s CODM assessed performance and allocated resources based on five operating segments: Citrus Groves, Improved Farmland, Ranch and Conservation, Agricultural Supply Chain Management and Other Operations. 

&#160; 

Effective October 1, 2015, which was the first day of Alico's fiscal year 2016, the Company operates three business segments related to its various land holdings, as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Orange Co. &#32;includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves in order to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus markets, including activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and hauling of citrus. 

&#8226; 

Conservation and Environmental Resources includes activities related to cattle grazing, sod, native plant and animal sales, leasing, management and/or conservation of unimproved native pasture land. 

&#8226; 

Other Operations consists of activities related to rock mining royalties, oil exploration and other insignificant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing improved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various improvements including irrigation, drainage and roads. 

The former Citrus Groves and Agricultural Supply Chain Management segments have been combined in Orange Co. &#32;and, as a result of the disposition of its sugarcane land in fiscal year 2015, the Company is no longer involved in sugarcane and the Improved Farmland segment is no longer material to its business and has been combined in Other Operations. 

The Land We Manage 

We regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total 

return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and will be sold or exchanged for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile. 

Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:

Orange Co. 

We own and manage citrus land in Alachua, DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, Osceola, Martin, and Hardee Counties and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Orange Co. &#32;citrus groves totals approximately 48,000 gross acres or 39.1% of our land holdings.

Of the approximately 48,000 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, approximately 13,200 acres are classified as support acreage. Support acreage includes acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a citrus tree nursery and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. None of our citrus acreage is classified as available for sale. The approximately 34,300 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (acres that are planted in trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow. 

Our Orange Co. &#32;business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market are approximately 86.9% of Orange Co. &#32;revenues annually. We produce Early and Mid-Season varieties, primarily Hamlin oranges, as well as a Valencia variety for the processed market. We deliver our fruit to the processors in boxes which contain approximately 90 pounds of oranges. Because the processors convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice, they generally do not buy their citrus on a per box basis but rather on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of citrus fruit. We produced approximately 51,400,000, 62,200,000 and 26,600,000 pound solids for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on boxes delivered to processing plants of approximately 8,829,000, 10,014,000 and 4,146,000, respectively. 

The average pound solids per box was 5.82 , 6.21 &#32;and 6.41 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (&#8220;floor&#8221;) price with a price increase (&#8220;rise&#8221;) based on market conditions. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price. 

The majority of our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2016-2017 will be under minimum price contracts with a floor prices ranging from $2.05 to $2.15 per pound solids. We believe that other markets are available for our citrus products; however, new arrangements may be less favorable than our current contracts. 

Our sales to the fresh market constitute approximately 3.8% of our Orange Co. &#32;revenues annually. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 402,000, 466,000 and 213,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The majority of our citrus to be produced for the fresh citrus market in fiscal year 2016-2017 is under fixed price contracts. 

Revenues from our Orange Co. &#32;operations were approximately 95.2% , 95.5% &#32;and 71.9% &#32;of our total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Conservation and Environmental &#32; Resources 

We own and manage Conservation and Environmental Resources land in Collier and Hendry Counties and engage in cattle production, sod and native plant sales, land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes and conservation activities. Of our land holdings, Conservation and Environmental Resources totals approximately 71,000 gross acres or 58.3% of our total acreage. 

Our Conservation and Environmental Resources acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2016 :

Our cattle operation is engaged in the production of beef cattle and is located in Hendry and Collier Counties. The breeding herd consists of approximately 8,700 cows and bulls and we plan to increase the size of our herd in the near future to the extent practicable. We primarily sell our calves to feed yards and yearling grazing operations in the United States. We also sell cattle through local livestock auction markets and to contract cattle buyers in the United States. These buyers provide ready markets for our cattle. We believe that the loss of any one or a few of these buyers would not have a material effect on our cattle operations. 

Revenues from our Conservation and Environmental Resources operations were approximately 4.0%, 3.6% and 7.9% of total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Our Strategy 

Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and/or acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential. 

Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell-under productive land not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholders, customers, clients and partners. 

Our strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations, environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company&#8217;s core beliefs. 

Competition 

The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates. Beef cattle are produced throughout the United States and domestic beef sales also compete with imported beef. 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require lessees of our property to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had 333 &#32;full-time employees. Our employees work in the following divisions:

Capital resources and raw materials 

Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use. Raw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.
