Lending Activities 

&#160; 

The Bank offers a variety of loans, including residential real estate loans, construction, land acquisition and development loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, loans to state and political subdivisions, and consumer loans, generally to individuals and businesses in its primary market area. These lending activities are described in further detail below. 

&#160; 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

&#160; 

The Bank offers a variety of fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans including First Time Homebuyer mortgages and Home Possible&#174; mortgages to meet the home financing needs of customers with low downpayments. The Bank also offers a &#8220;WOW&#8221; mortgage, a first-lien, fixed-rate mortgage product with maturity terms of 7.5, 10 and 14.5 years. At December 31, 2015, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $130.7 million, or 17.9%, of the total loan portfolio. Except for the WOW mortgage, one- to four-family mortgage loans are originated generally for sale in the secondary market. However, management may portfolio one- to four-family residential mortgage loans as deemed necessary according to current asset/liability management strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank sold $7.9 million of one- to four-family mortgages. The Bank retains servicing rights on these mortgages. 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, construction, land acquisition and development loans amounted to $30.8 million and represented 4.2% of the total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Loans 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, commercial real estate loans totaled $245.2 million, or 33.5%, of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate mortgage loans represent the largest portion of the Bank&#8217;s total loan portfolio and loans in this portfolio generally have larger loan balances. The commercial real estate loan portfolio is secured by a broad range of real estate, including but not limited to, office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, warehouses, gas stations, convenience markets, residential care facilities, nursing care facilities, restaurants, multifamily housing, farms and land subdivisions. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Industrial Loans 

&#160; 

The Bank generally offers commercial loans to individuals and businesses located in its primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes, but is not limited to, lines of credit, dealer floor plan lines, equipment loans, vehicle loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, deposit accounts and real estate. At December 31, 2015, commercial and industrial loans totaled $149.8 million, or 20.5%, of the total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans 

&#160; 

Consumer loans include both secured and unsecured installment loans, lines of credit and overdraft protection loans. The Bank is also in the business of underwriting indirect auto loans which are originated through various auto dealers in northeastern Pennsylvania and dealer floor plan loans. Generally, the Bank also offers home equity loans and lines of credit with a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio of 90%, based on the appraised value of the property. Home equity loans have fixed rates of interest and are for terms up to 15 years. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates and are based off of the prime interest rate. At December 31, 2015, consumer loans totaled $128.6 million, or 17.6%, of the total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

State and Political Subdivision Loans 

&#160; 

The Bank originates state and political subdivision loans, including general obligation and tax anticipation notes, primarily to municipalities in the Bank&#8217;s market area. At December 31, 2015, state and political subdivision loans totaled $46.1 million, or 6.3%, of the total loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

For more information regarding the loan portfolio and lending policies, please refer to Note 2 &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Wealth Management 

&#160; 

The Company offers customers wealth management services through a third party provider. Customers are able to access alternative deposit products such as mutual funds, annuities, stocks, and bonds directly for purchase from an outside provider. 

&#160; 

Deposit Activities 

&#160; 

In general, deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bank&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment purposes. The Bank grows its deposits within its market area primarily by offering a wide selection of deposit accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of the Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts, the Bank considers the interest rates offered by its competitors, the interest rates available on borrowings, its liquidity needs and customer preferences. The Bank regularly reviews its deposit mix and deposit pricing as part of its asset/liability management, taking into consideration rates offered by competitors in its market area. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence, as well as other financial institutions outside of its market area through online loan and deposit product offerings. The competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and, with respect to deposits, institutions offering investment alternatives, including money market funds and online savings accounts. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines, as well as from economic conditions. The cost of regulatory compliance remains high for community banks as compared to their larger competitors that are able to achieve economies of scale. 

&#160; 

As a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of the Bank&#8217;s competitors and their respective affiliates are larger and may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, a wider array of services, or more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. The Company considers its major competition to be local commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in the Company&#8217;s market area. Competitors may offer deposits at higher rates and loans with lower fixed rates, more attractive terms and less stringent credit structures than the Company has been able to offer. The growth and profitability of the Company depend on its continued ability to successfully compete. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company participates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to a variety of statutes, regulations and policies, as well as ongoing regulatory supervision and review. These laws, regulations and policies are subject to frequent change and the Company takes measures to comply with applicable requirements. 

&#160; 

Supervisory Actions 

&#160; 

The Bank was under a Consent Order (the &#8220;Order&#8221;) from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) dated September 1, 2010. On March 25, 2015, after meeting all of the requirements of the Order, the Bank was fully and completely released from the Order. The Company was also subject to a Written Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the &#8220;Reserve Bank&#8221;) dated November 24, 2010. On September 8, 2015, the Company was notified by the Reserve Bank that, effective September 2, 2015, it had been fully and completely released from the Written Agreement. 

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

The Company is a bank holding company registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Reserve Bank and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. 

&#160; 

The BHCA requires approval of the FRB for, among other things, the acquisition by a proposed bank holding company of control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The BHCA also generally permits the acquisition by a bank holding company of control or substantially all the assets of any bank located in a state other than the home state of the bank holding company, except where the bank has not been in existence for the minimum period of time required by state law; but if the bank is at least 5 years old, the FRB may approve the acquisition. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

With certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in, or acquire an interest in a company that engages in, activities that the FRB has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such a determination, the FRB is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The FRB is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern. Some of the activities that the FRB has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. 

&#160; 

Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, or investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. A subsidiary bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to such bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust service; (ii) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the bank holding company or any other subsidiary of the bank holding company; or (iii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or service from competitors, except for reasonable requirements to assure the soundness of credit extended. 

&#160; 

The Gramm Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which allows such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities without further approval. The Company is not a financial holding company. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the FRB to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. 

&#160; 

The Bank 

&#160; 

The Bank, as a national bank, is a member of the Federal Reserve System and its accounts are insured up to the maximum legal limit by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the OCC. The regulations of these agencies and the FDIC govern most aspects of the Bank&#8217;s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and location and number of branch offices. State laws may also apply to the Bank to the extent that federal law does not preempt the state law. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. 

&#160; 

On February 26, 2016, the Bank filed an application with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities to convert from an OCC-chartered banking institution to a Pennsylvania state-chartered banking institution and has notified the OCC and the FDIC of the same. If and when the conversion application is approved, the primary banking regulators of the Bank would become the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC. The Company would continue to be regulated by the Federal Reserve. There can be no assurance as to the ability and timing to obtain the requisite approvals of the foregoing conversion application. 

&#160; 

Branching and Interstate Banking. The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether such transactions are prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks has opted out of the interstate bank merger provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#8220;Riegle-Neal Act&#8221;) by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act and before June 1, 1997 that applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate bank mergers are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the Riegle-Neal Act. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) permits national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be so permitted. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Pennsylvania law had previously permitted banks chartered in Pennsylvania to branch in other states without limitation, thereby permitting national banks in Pennsylvania to establish branches anywhere in the state, but only permitted out of state banks to branch in Pennsylvania if the home state of the out of state bank permits Pennsylvania banks to establish de novo branches. The branching provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could result in more banks from other states establishing de novo branches in the Bank&#8217;s market area. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act and BSA. Under the BSA, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and that the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect, involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221; or the &#8220;Patriot Act,&#8221; financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements. The FRB and OCC have adopted risk based capital adequacy and leverage capital adequacy requirements pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. 

&#160; 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;). The regulations adopted by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, when fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Basel III final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduces as a new capital measure &#8220;Common Equity Tier I&#8221; (&#8220;CET I&#8221;), (ii) specifies that Tier I capital consists of CET I and &#8220;Additional Tier I capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET I narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET I and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 

&#160; 

When fully phased-in, Basel III requires banks to maintain (i) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET I to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.50%, plus a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.50 %; (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.00%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.50%; (iii) a minimum ratio of total (Tier I plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.00% plus the capital conservation buffer, or 10.50%; and (iv) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%, calculated as the ratio of Tier I capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). 

&#160; 

Basel III also provides for a &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer,&#8221; generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a CET I add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0.00% to 2.50% when fully implemented. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. 

&#160; 

Banking institutions with a ratio of CET I to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, to effect equity repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall. 

&#160; 

The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET I. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET I to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10.00% of CET I or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15.00% of CET I. 

&#160; 

The federal banking regulators issued a final rulemaking in July 2013 (the &#8220;Basel III Rule&#8221;) to implement Basel III under regulations substantially consistent with the above. The Basel III Rule also includes, as part of the definition of CET I capital, a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI,&#8221; which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, that are not required to be treated as OTTI, net of tax) in calculating regulatory capital, unless the institution makes a one-time opt-out election from this provision in connection with the filing of its first regulatory reports after applicability of the Basel III Rule to that institution. The Basel III Rule also imposes a 4.00% minimum Tier I leverage ratio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Basel III Rule also makes changes to the manner of calculating risk-weighted assets. It imposes methodologies for determining risk weighted assets, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, such as a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors. They also include risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components. 

&#160; 

As discussed below, the Basel III Rule also integrates the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action provisions under Section 38 of the FDIA. 

&#160; 

In general, the Basel III Rule became applicable to the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015. The Company and Bank elected to exclude AOCI in calculating regulatory capital with the filing of their respective first regulatory reports after applicability of the Basel III Rule to them. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s outstanding subordinated notes are subject to phase out and will cease to qualify as capital for regulatory purposes. Overall, the Company believes that implementation of the Basel III Rule did not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s or Bank&#8217;s capital ratios, earnings, shareholder&#8217;s equity, or its ability to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. 

&#160; 

The following are the capital requirements under the Basel III Rules integrated into the prompt corrective action category definitions. As of December 31, 2015, the following capital requirements were applicable to the Bank for purposes of Section 38 of the FDIA.

At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s common equity Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratios were 9.42% and 12.69%, respectively.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority . Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. 

&#160; 

The Bank and its &#8220;institution-affiliated parties,&#8221; including its management, employees, agents, independent contractors, consultants such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution&#8217;s affairs, are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law, regulations or written orders of a governmental agency. In addition, regulators are provided with greater flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties. Possible enforcement actions include the termination of deposit insurance and cease-and-desist orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnifications or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate. 

&#160; 

Under provisions of the federal securities laws, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in fines, restitution, a limitation of permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations can also affect a public company in its timing and ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss allowances for regulatory purposes. 

&#160; 

As a result of the previous volatility and instability in the financial system, Congress, the bank regulatory authorities and other government agencies have called for or proposed additional regulation and restrictions on the activities, practices and operations of banks and their holding companies. While many of these proposals relate to institutions that have accepted investments from, or sold troubled assets to, the Department of the Treasury or other government agencies, or otherwise participate in government programs intended to promote financial stabilization, Congress and the federal banking agencies have broad authority to require all banks and holding companies to adhere to more rigorous or costly operating procedures, corporate governance procedures, or to engage in activities or practices which they might not otherwise elect. Any such requirement could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. The Company did not accept an investment by the Treasury Department in its preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock, and except for the temporary increases in deposit insurance for customer accounts, has not participated in any of the programs adopted by the Treasury Department, FDIC or Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act . The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act has required a number of federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare various studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting these rules and regulations. To date, the following provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are considered to be of greatest significance to the Company: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

expands the authority of the FRB to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including insured depository institutions; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive approval of an interstate bank acquisition; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; changes standards for federal preemption of state laws related to national banks and their subsidiaries; &#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer&#8217;s ability to pay and making more loans subject to provisions for higher-cost loans and new disclosures; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

introduces additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements on companies subject to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; permits FDIC-insured banks to pay interest on business demand deposits; &#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

requires that holding companies and other companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of financial strength; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance at all insured depository institutions; and &#160;

&#160; &#9679; 

permits national and state banks to establish interstate branches to the same extent as the branch host state allows establishment of in-state branches. 

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new independent federal agency within the Federal Reserve System, having broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB, which began operations on July 21, 2011, has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions, including the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for compliance with federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A focus of the CFPB&#8217;s rulemaking efforts has been on reforms related to residential mortgage transactions. In 2013, the CFPB issued final rules related to a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, requirements for high-cost mortgages, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. Several of the CFPB&#8217;s rulemakings became effective in January 2014. In November 2013, the CFPB issued final rules establishing integrated disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed end, real estate secured consumer loans. These rules became effective in August 2015. During 2015, the CFPB issued additional rulemaking expanding the scope of information lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housing-related loan applications under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 

&#160; 

The final rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, which went into effect on January 10, 2014, establishes certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations, and establishes certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The rule affords greater legal protections for lenders making qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher priced.&#8221; Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and a points and fees requirement whereby the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Mandatory features of a qualified mortgage include: (1) a loan term not exceeding 30 years and (2) regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. The rule creates special categories of qualified mortgages originated by certain smaller creditors. The Bank&#8217;s current business strategy, product offerings, and profitability may change as the rule is interpreted by the regulators and courts. 

&#160; 

The final rules adopting new mortgage servicing standards, which took effect on January 10, 2014, impose new requirements regarding force-placed insurance, mandate certain notices prior to rate adjustments on adjustable-rate mortgages, and establish requirements for periodic disclosures to borrowers. These requirements will affect notices to be given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding &#8220;force-placed&#8221; insurance. Servicers will be prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. Servicers must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance Premiums. The FDIC maintains a risk-based assessment system for determining deposit insurance premiums. Four risk categories (I-IV), each subject to different premium rates, are established based upon an institution&#8217;s status as well capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized, and the institution&#8217;s supervisory rating. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on a financial institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts. 

&#160; 

An insured institution is required to pay deposit insurance premiums on its assessment base in accordance with its risk category. There are three adjustments that can be made to an institution&#8217;s initial base assessment rate: (1) a potential decrease for long-term unsecured debt, including senior and subordinated debt and, for small institutions, a portion of Tier I capital; (2) a potential increase for secured liabilities above a threshold amount; and (3) for non-Risk Category I institutions, a potential increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. 

&#160; 

Effective February 2, 2015 and for the remainder of the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank was considered risk category I for deposit insurance assessments and paid an annual assessment rate ranging from 0.0005 basis points to 0.0006 basis points on the assessment base of average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Dividend Restrictions 

&#160; 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company&#8217;s revenues (on a parent company only basis) result almost entirely from dividends paid by its subsidiary, the Bank, to the Company. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of creditors and shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary (including depositors) except to the extent that claims of the Company, in its capacity as a creditor, may be recognized. Additionally, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company is subject to various regulatory restrictions. 

&#160; 

The declaration of cash dividends on the Company&#8217;s common stock is at the discretion of its board of directors, and any decision to declare a dividend is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings, prospects, financial condition, regulatory capital levels, applicable covenants under any credit agreements, notes and other contractual restrictions, Pennsylvania law, federal bank regulatory law, and other factors deemed relevant. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank employed 269 persons, including 39 part-time employees.
