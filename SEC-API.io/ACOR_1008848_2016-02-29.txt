 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of novel therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies, including Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg, a treatment to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. We also market Zanaflex Capsules and tablets, FDA-approved as short-acting drugs for the management of spasticity, and Qutenza, an FDA-approved dermal patch for the management of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, also known as post-shingles pain. 

&#160;

We have five Orange Book-listed patents providing protection for Ampyra up to 2027. Ampyra also has Orphan Drug designation, which gives it marketing exclusivity in the U.S. until January 2017. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from several generic drug manufacturers, and also inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. An adverse outcome in these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange-Book listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described below under &#8220;Company Highlights &#8211; Ampyra/Fampyra Patents and Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

We have an industry leading pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including MS, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD), epilepsy and migraine. Our goal is to help patients to a better future, while building a leading neurology company with a portfolio of innovative products. Our pipeline includes the following three late stage programs: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

CVT-301, an inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, using our proprietary ARCUS technology, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of people with epilepsy currently on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

A program evaluating the use of twice-daily (BID) dalfampridine to improve walking in people who are suffering from chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD), and exploring a once daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in this program. 

&#160;

We are expecting important clinical milestones in 2016 for all three of these late-stage programs, including the completion of a pivotal trial for the CVT-301 program this year, and we plan to file New Drug Applications for both the CVT-301 and Plumiaz programs in 2017. We project that these two therapies, if approved, could generate combined peak annual U.S. net revenue of more than $700 million. Also, in 2016 we expect to perform an interim analysis in our Phase 3 trial of dalfampridine for chronic post-stroke walking deficits. This analysis, combined with results from our development efforts on a once-daily formulation of dalfampridine, will establish the next steps for the program. 

&#160;

In January 2016, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Biotie Therapies Corp. for a cash purchase price of approximately $363 million. Subject to completion of the acquisition, which we 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

expect to occur in the third quarter of 2016, we would acquire worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients to reduce OFF time. A2a receptor antagonists have the potential to be the first new class of drug for Parkinson&#8217;s disease in over 20 years. We believe that tozadenant would be complementary to our other Phase 3 product for Parkinson's disease, CVT-301, because while tozadenant is aimed at reducing overall OFF time, CVT-301 is aimed at rapid improvement of OFF periods when they occur. We project that, if approved, tozadenant could generate peak annual U.S. net revenue of more than $400 million. Further expanding our pipeline, if we complete the acquisition we would also obtain global rights to SYN120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A dual receptor antagonist for Parkinson&#8217;s-related dementia, in Phase 2 development with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Also, Biotie receives double digit royalties from sales of Selincro, a European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved orally administered therapy for alcohol dependence therapy. Selincro has been introduced across Europe in 29 countries by Biotie&#8217;s partner, H. Lundbeck A/S, a Danish pharmaceutical company specializing in central nervous system products. Selincro is not approved for use in the U.S. and is not under development for use in the U.S.

&#160;

Concurrently with the announcement of the Biotie transaction, we announced two separate financing transactions. The first was a private placement of 2,250,900 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $75 million. We paid discounts and commissions of $2,250,900 in connection with the private placement, which settled on January 26, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from the private placement to fund, in part, the acquisition of Biotie described above. If the acquisition is not consummated for any reason, we will use all of the net proceeds from the private placement for general corporate purposes. We also announced a commitment from JPMorgan Chase, N.A. for an asset-based credit facility for up to $60 million. The closing of this credit facility transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

We are focused on continuing to grow as a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company by commercializing our FDA-approved products, developing our product candidates and advancing our research and development programs for underserved markets. We are seeking to leverage our financial strength to invest in our pipeline of research and development programs, and potentially to acquire additional products that will fit with our commercial structure and expertise in both neurology and specialty pharmaceuticals. Our goal is to create a balanced portfolio that creates significant near-term value, as well as intermediate and longer-term opportunities for further value accretion. 

&#160;

Company Highlights 

&#160;

Ampyra 

&#160;

Ampyra is the first product for which we completed clinical development. Ampyra, an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), was approved by the FDA in January 2010. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product indicated to improve walking in people with MS. Ampyra was made commercially available in the U.S. in March 2010, using our own specialty sales force, and had net revenue of $436.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Since the March 2010 launch of Ampyra, more than 110,000 people with MS in the U.S. have tried Ampyra. We believe that Ampyra is increasingly considered by many physicians a standard of care to improve walking in people with MS. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 70% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra received a first refill, and approximately 40% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra have been dispensed at least six months of the medicine through refills, consistent with previously reported trends. These refill rates exclude patients who started Ampyra through our First Step trial program. Our First Step program provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. During 2015, on average more than 70% of new Ampyra patients enrolled in First Step. The program is in its fifth year, and data show that First Step participants have higher compliance and persistency rates over time compared to non-First Step 

&#160;

&#160; 

pati ents. Approximately 50% of patients who initiate Ampyra therapy with the First Step free trial program convert to paid prescriptions. 

Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. &#8211; Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare &#8211; have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA&#8217;s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans. 

&#160; 

Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease. 

&#160;

Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH (formerly Biogen Idec International GmbH), or Biogen, under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. &#160; Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2016. Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of Fampyra and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones. We received a $25 million milestone payment from Biogen in 2011, which was triggered by Biogen&#8217;s receipt of conditional approval from the European Commission for Fampyra. The next expected milestone payment would be $15 million, due when ex-U.S. net sales exceed $100 million over four consecutive quarters. 

&#160;

In October 2015, we presented 5-year post-marketing safety data for dalfampridine extended release tablets in MS at the 31 st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. The data presented continue to be consistent with those reported in double-blind clinical trials, with incidence of reported seizure remaining stable over time. 

&#160;

Ampyra/Fampyra Patents and Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The first is U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Based on the final patent term adjustment calculation of the USPTO, this patent will extend into 2027. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The second is U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938, the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease, such as MS, and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation, such as AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg for improving walking in people with MS. In April 2013, this patent received a five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With a five year patent term extension, this patent will expire in 2018. We have an exclusive license to this patent from Alkermes (originally with Elan, but transferred to Alkermes as part of its acquisition of Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The third is U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437, which includes claims relating to methods to improve walking, increase walking speed, and treat walking disability in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2026. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The fourth is U.S. Patent No. 8,440,703, which includes claims directed to methods of improving lower extremity function and walking and increasing walking speed in patients with MS by administering less than 15 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2025. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The fifth is U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685 with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Absent patent term adjustment, the patent is set to expire in 2025. 

Ampyra also has Orphan Drug designation, which gives it marketing exclusivity in the U.S. until January 2017. 

In 2014, we received eight Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters from generic drug manufacturers advising that they had submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they have also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In response to the filing of these ANDAs, we filed lawsuits against all of these companies alleging multiple counts of patent infringement. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single case. The court has scheduled a Markman hearing on March 7, 2016, and has set a five day bench trial starting on September 19, 2016. This litigation is further described below in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We filed these lawsuits within 45 days from the date of receipt of each of the Paragraph IV Certification Notices. As a result, a 30 month statutory stay of approval period applies to each of the ANDAs under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The 30 month statutory stay starts from January 22, 2015, which is the end of the new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity period for Ampyra. This restricts the FDA from approving the ANDAs until July 2017 at the earliest, unless a Federal district court issues a decision adverse to all of our asserted Orange Book-listed patents prior to that date. In October and December 2015, we entered into settlement agreements with two of the generic drug manufacturers, Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., respectively. These settlements do not resolve pending patent litigation that we brought against other ANDA filers, described in this report. 

In May 2015, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice from Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Inc. (&#8220;Sun&#8221;) advising that they had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for a generic version of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. Sun challenged the validity of four of our five Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra , and they also asserted that generic versions of their products may not infringe certain claims of these patents. In response to the filing, we filed a lawsuit against Sun in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging multiple counts of patent infringement. In October 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sun to resolve this patent litigation. The settlement with Sun does not resolve pending patent litigation that we brought against the other ANDA filers, described in this report. 

In September 2015, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice from Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (&#8220;Par&#8221;) advising that it had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for a generic version of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg. Par challenged the validity of four of our five Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra. In response to the filing of the ANDA, in September 2015 we filed a lawsuit against Par in the U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting infringement. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement agreement with Par to resolve this patent litigation. The settlement with Par does not resolve pending patent litigation that we brought against the other ANDA filers, described in this report. 

In February 2015, a hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) filed two separate inter partes review (IPR) petitions with the U.S. 

&#160; 

Patent and Trademark Office, challenging U.S. Patent Nos. 8,663,685, and 8,007,826, which are two of the five Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. In August 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trials and Appeals Board ruled that it would not institute inter partes review of either of these patents. In September 2015, however, the hedge fund filed two motions for reconsideration to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trials and Appeals Board, requesting that the denial to institute these two IPRs be reversed. 

In September 2015, the same hedge fund filed four separate IPR petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These new IPR petitions challenge the same two patents that were the subject of the February 2015 IPR petitions and also U.S. Patent Nos. 8,354,437 and 8,440,703. The challenged patents are four of the five Ampyra Orange-Book listed patents. We have opposed the requests to institute these IPRs, and if one or more is allowed to proceed, we will oppose the full proceedings and defend our patents. The 30 month statutory stay period based on patent infringement suits filed by us against ANDA filers is not impacted by these filings, and remains in effect. 

In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. On February 24, 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021. 

&#160;

We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

The ANDA and IPR litigation and legal proceedings discussed above are further described in Part I, Item 3 of this report. 

&#160;

CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology 

&#160;

In October 2014, we acquired Civitas Therapeutics, Inc., a privately-held pharmaceutical company with global rights to CVT-301, a Phase 3 treatment candidate for OFF periods of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, or PD. Our acquisition of Civitas also included rights to Civitas&#8217; proprietary ARCUS pulmonary delivery technology, which we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas, and a leased manufacturing facility in Chelsea, Massachusetts with commercial-scale capabilities. CVT-301 is an inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease is characterized by symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease is oral levodopa, but there are significant challenges in creating a dosing regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson&#8217;s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease. CVT-301 is based on the proprietary ARCUS technology platform that we acquired with Civitas. The ARCUS technology is a dry-powder pulmonary delivery system that allows delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with 

&#160;

&#160; 

conventional dry powder formulations. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 study of CVT-301 for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. We expect results from the efficacy trial in the fourth quarter of 2016, and pending timely recruitment for clinical trials, our goal is to file a new drug application, or NDA, in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of CVT-301 in the U.S. alone could exceed $500 million. 

&#160;

In addition to CVT-301, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan (zolmitriptan) intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS delivery system. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in a nasally-delivered formulation. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally-delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. In December 2015, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of CVT-427 for acute treatment of migraine. We expect to provide an update on this program by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

Plumiaz 

We are developing Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, for the treatment of people with epilepsy currently on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures. In 2013, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) filing for Plumiaz to the FDA. In May 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Plumiaz NDA. In May 2015, we announced that we completed discussions with the FDA, and are advancing development of Plumiaz. Based on these discussions, we are conducting three clinical trials for Plumiaz, which we have initiated and are currently enrolling. We are planning to resubmit the NDA for Plumiaz in the first quarter of 2017. If approved, we project peak annual U.S. net revenue of more than $200 million. 

Ampyra/Dalfampridine Development Programs 

We believe there may be potential for dalfampridine to be applied to neurological conditions in addition to MS. In December 2014, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 clinical trial of dalfampridine to evaluate the use of dalfampridine administered twice daily (BID) to improve walking in people who are suffering from chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD) after experiencing an ischemic stroke. As part of the trial design, we are planning to conduct an interim analysis of the trial data in the third quarter of 2016. This analysis, combined with the results from our development efforts on a once-daily formulation of dalfampridine (described below), will establish the next steps for the program. 

We have been exploring a once-daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in the post-stroke clinical program. Based on the results of an in vitro alcohol dose dumping study and a subsequent fed-fasted study, we determined that the initial QD formulation that we had been developing with an external partner was not practical for further testing. We are working with different external partners to develop a new QD formulation that could be included in future post-stroke studies. We currently have three prototypes from three different partners based on in vitro testing, which do not have the alcohol dose dumping issue we identified with the initial QD formulation. All three prototypes are currently in Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies, and we expect to provide an update on these studies by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Remyelinating Antibodies 

&#160;

rHIgM22 is the lead antibody in our remyelinating antibody program, and we are developing it as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. In April 2013, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of rHIgM22 to assess the safety and tolerability of rHIgM22 in patients with MS. The study also included several exploratory clinical, imaging and biomarker measures. &#160; We announced top-line safety and tolerability results in February 2015. The trial, which followed participants for up to six months after receiving a single dose of rHIgM22, found no dose-limiting toxicities at any of the five dose levels studied. In April 2015, we presented additional safety data from this trial at the 67th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. The additional data showed that rHIgM22 was well tolerated in each of the five doses, supporting additional clinical development. In October 2015, we presented pharmacokinetics from the trial in patients with stable MS, confirming that rHIgM22 penetrates the central nervous system. This data was presented at the 31 st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. We are advancing clinical development of rHIgM22 for MS. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect to complete the trial in the first half of 2017. 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa /Neuregulins 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa is our lead product candidate for our neuregulin program. We completed a cimaglermin Phase 1 clinical trial in heart failure patients. This was a dose-escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose, with follow-up assessments at one, three, and six months. Data from this trial showed a dose-related improvement in ejection fraction in addition to safety findings. A dose-limiting toxicity was also identified in the highest planned dose cohort, specifically acute liver injury meeting Hy&#8217;s Law for drug induced hepatotoxicity, which resolved within several days. In March 2015, we presented new analyses of data from this trial at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 64 th Annual Scientific Session and Expo. These analyses found that cimaglermin produced a dose-dependent benefit at multiple time points for up to three months following a single infusion. 

&#160;

In 2013, we commenced a second clinical trial of cimaglermin . This Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure is assessing tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin , which were tested in the first trial, and also includes assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. In June 2015, we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) meeting Hy&#8217;s Law criteria (elevated ALT, AST and bilirubin), based on blood test results. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information, and the trial remains subject to this clinical hold. The abnormal blood tests resolved within several days, as was the case with the one Hy&#8217;s Law case reported in the previous Phase 1 study noted above. The 22 patients who were dosed in the trial will complete the pre-planned one year of follow up. Outside of the hepatoxicity case, the safety profile from this trial was consistent with our first Phase 1 trial, but efficacy data was inconclusive which we believe was in part due to the very small number of patients in the trial. We have ongoing analyses and non-clinical studies to investigate the biological basis for liver effects, and we will need to meet with the FDA to review these and other data from the cimaglermin studies and to request that the program be removed from clinical hold. 

&#160;

Corporate Update 

We currently lease approximately 163,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Ardsley, NY. This space includes 25,405 square feet of expansion space that we occupied in the first quarter of 2015 pursuant to expansion options in our lease for this facility. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In January 2016, we engaged Burkhard Blank, M.D., to assume the responsibilities of Chief Medical Officer on an interim basis. Dr. Blank has more than 25 years of industry experience, holding senior leadership positions with responsibility for managing international clinical trial programs, as well as heading regulatory affairs, statistics, drug safety and related departments. Dr. Blank was engaged upon the departure of Enrique Carrazana, M.D., our former Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Carrazana is expected to serve as a consultant to the company for at least six (6) months following his departure. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy is to continue to grow as a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company and to be a leading neurology company focused on the identification, development and commercialization of a range of nervous system therapeutics. We are using our scientific, clinical and commercial expertise in neurology as strategic points of access to additional nervous system markets, including stroke, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and epilepsy. In 2016, we are focused on the following priorities: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Progressing development of our late stage programs, including: CVT-301, an inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, using our proprietary ARCUS technology in Phase 3 development for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease; Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of people with epilepsy currently on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures; and our program evaluating the use of twice-daily (BID) dalfampridine to improve waking in people who are suffering from chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD), and exploring a once daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in this program. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pending Biotie Therapies Acquisition 

&#160;

On January 19, 2016, we entered into a combination agreement to acquire Biotie Therapies Corp. for a cash purchase price of approximately $363 million. Pursuant to the combination agreement, which is further described below, we will make a public all cash tender offer in the U.S. and Finland for all of Biotie&#8217;s outstanding capital stock. If we close the tender offer pursuant to the combination agreement, we expect to complete the acquisition of the balance of any Biotie capital stock not acquired through the tender offer in the third quarter of 2016. We believe this pending acquisition is an important step in our strategic plan described above. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Biotie is a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on developing therapeutics for central nervous system disorders. Biotie&#8217;s currently active pipeline includes: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Tozadenant, an oral product candidate, and selective inhibitor of the adenosine A 2a receptor that Biotie is developing as an adjunct to levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease to reduce OFF time; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

SYN120, an oral product candidate to treat both cognitive deficits and psychosis, which frequently coincide in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

BTT1023, a product candidate for the orphan disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic and progressive fibrotic liver disease for which there is no FDA-approved treatment. 

&#160;

Also, Biotie receives double digit royalties from sales of Selincro , a European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved orally administered therapy for alcohol dependence therapy. Selincro has been introduced across Europe in 29 countries by Biotie's partner, H. Lundbeck A/S, a Danish pharmaceutical company specializing in central nervous system products. Selincro is not approved for use in the U.S. and is not under development for use in the U.S. 

&#160;

Combination Agreement 

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the combination agreement, we will offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares, American Depositary Shares (&#8220;ADS&#8221;), options, restricted unit awards and warrants (collectively, the &#8220;Equity Interests&#8221;) in Biotie through a public tender offer (the &#8220;Tender Offer&#8221;), and, if necessary, through subsequent compulsory redemption proceedings in accordance with the Finnish Companies Act (together with the Tender Offer, the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). 

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the combination agreement, the consideration offered by us for all issued and outstanding shares, ADSs, options, restricted unit awards and warrants of Biotie in the Transaction is (i) EUR 0.2946 in cash per share, (ii) EUR 23.5680 in cash per ADS, (iii) various prices for the options and restricted unit awards depending on their exercise price and (iv) EUR 0.1664 in cash per warrant. 

&#160;

The consummation of the Transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, (i) the valid tender to (or other acquisition by) us of at least 90 percent of the issued and outstanding shares and voting rights of Biotie on a fully diluted basis, and (ii) the combination agreement not having been terminated. The waiting period for the Transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act expired on February 16, 2016. 

&#160;

Consummation of the Transaction is not conditioned on our receipt of any financing. The consummation of the Tender Offer is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2016 and the consummation of the Transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

We and Biotie have each made customary representations and warranties in the combination agreement. 

&#160;

The combination agreement includes certain customary termination provisions. In particular, the combination agreement may be terminated with immediate effect at any time prior to closing (i) by Biotie if its board of directors has cancelled or changed its recommendation concerning the Transaction in compliance with the provisions of the combination agreement, (ii) by us if Biotie&#8217;s board of directors has cancelled or changed its recommendation concerning the Transaction in a manner detrimental to us or (iii) by either party if the closing of the Tender Offer has not occurred by June 19, 2016 (except where the failure to close by such date resulted from such party&#8217;s breach of the combination agreement). The combination agreement also provides for Biotie to pay us a termination fee of USD 4,500,000 as compensation for our reasonable costs if the combination agreement is, as a result of a competing offer or competing proposal, terminated by Biotie or us in connection 

&#160;

&#160; 

with a cancellation or change of the recommendation of Biotie&#8217;s board of directors concerning the Transaction. 

&#160; 

The combination agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Finland. 

&#160;

Certain Biotie shareholders and ADS holders representing more than a majority of the outstanding shares and votes (on a fully diluted basis) in Biotie have, subject to certain customary conditions, irrevocably undertaken to accept the Tender Offer. This includes all the holders of Biotie warrants and members of the management team of Biotie, who have subject to certain customary conditions irrevocably undertaken to tender their equity instruments into the Tender Offer. Each of the undertakings will terminate upon certain customary termination events, including in the event the combination agreement is terminated. 

&#160;

2015 Financing Transactions 

&#160;

Concurrently with our entering into the Biotie combination agreement described above, we announced two separate financing transactions. The first was the issuance of 2,250,900 shares of our common stock to an initial purchaser in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). The shares were issued to the initial purchaser in reliance on the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act. The aggregate offering price for the shares the initial purchaser was $74,999,988. In connection with the private placement, we paid $2,250,900 in aggregate discounts and commissions. The settlement of the shares with the initial purchaser occurred on January 26, 2016. We intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the shares to fund, in part, the acquisition of Biotie described above. If the acquisition of Biotie is not consummated for any reason, we will use all of the net proceeds from the issuance of the shares for general corporate purposes. The shares will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. 

&#160;

Also, we received a commitment from JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. for a $60 million asset based revolving credit facility which will be secured by our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. Availability under the facility will be based on our and our domestic subsidiaries' accounts receivable, inventory and certain machinery and equipment, and the closing of the facility is subject to customary conditions, including the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2016.

Background on Neurological and Other Conditions 

&#160;

We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of novel therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. Where our neurology programs may also show promise for disorders outside of the nervous system, we may elect to pursue these opportunistically as well. Currently, our products and product pipeline are targeted to the conditions described below. We believe there is significant unmet medical need for these conditions, which can severely impact the lives of those who suffer from them. 

&#160;

Multiple Sclerosis 

&#160;

Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, usually progressive disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses, much as insulation facilitates conduction in an electrical wire. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body's own 

&#160;

&#160; 

immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the central nervous system, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. Patients with MS may suffer impairments in a wide range of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments they suffer on a day-to-day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day. 

&#160; 

Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease. 

&#160;

Parkinson&#8217;s Disease 

&#160;

Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons responsible for producing dopamine, which causes motor complications, including impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremors. Approximately one million Americans and 1.2 million Europeans suffer from Parkinson&#8217;s disease. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Current treatment strategies are focused on the management and reduction of the major symptoms of the disease and related disabilities. These therapies either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease symptoms is oral levodopa (L-dopa). Approximately 70% of people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease in the U. S. are treated with oral L-dopa. Effective control of Parkinson&#8217;s disease symptoms is referred to as an ON state. 

&#160;

As Parkinson&#8217;s disease progresses, even optimized regimens of oral L-dopa are associated with increasingly wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption into the bloodstream. This results in the unreliable control of symptoms, leading to motor complications including OFF periods. OFF periods, which are characterized by a re-emergence of Parkinson&#8217;s disease symptoms, increase in frequency and severity during the course of the disease. About half of people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease treated with L-dopa therapy experience OFF periods. For the approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. who experience them, OFF periods are inadequately addressed by available therapies and are considered one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. 

&#160;

Epilepsy 

&#160;

Epilepsy is a neurological condition that produces seizures affecting a variety of mental and physical functions. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally, possibly resulting in convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes - an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors. When a person has had two or more seizures he or she is considered to have epilepsy. EEGs and brain scans are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. 

&#160;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that approximately 2.3 million adults in the U.S. have active epilepsy. Active epilepsy is defined as those who take medication or have had at least one seizure in the past year. Seizures are generally classified as either partial onset, or focal, seizures, or generalized onset seizures. Approximately one third of epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment, meaning that they may still experience one or more breakthrough seizures despite an existing regimen of anti-epileptic drug (&#8220;AED&#8221;) therapy. It is estimated that approximately 175,000 people in the U.S. have seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, or ARS, which are characterized by bouts of increased seizure activity. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Ischemic Stroke 

&#160;

An ischemic stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and food, and causing the death of brain cells. Stroke may also be associated with damage to the myelin sheath of various nerve tracts in the brain. Over the first few months following a stroke, patients typically show some degree of spontaneous recovery of function, which may be enhanced by rehabilitation and physical therapy. After this initial recovery, patients may stabilize with chronic neurologic deficits. According to the American Stroke Association, or ASA, 795,000 people in the U.S. experience a stroke every year and approximately 7,000,000 people in the U.S. are living with the long term effects of stroke, or post-stroke deficits. Approximately 87% of all strokes are classified as ischemic strokes. Current treatments for post-stroke deficits include physical and occupational therapy, but there are no pharmacologic therapies indicated specifically to improve function. Approximately half of those living with post-stroke deficits - 3.5 million people - have ongoing mobility issues. Total direct annual stroke-related medical costs for 2012 were estimated to be approximately $72 billion . 

&#160; 

Migraine 

&#160;

Migraine is a neurological syndrome characterized by pain, nausea, abnormal sensitivity to sound and abnormal sensitivity to light. It is believed to affect over 10% of the global population. In the U. S., the National Institutes of Health estimates 12% of the population, or approximately 37 million people, suffer from migraine, with women being nearly three times more affected than men. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in a nasally-delivered formulation. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally-delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. 

&#160;

Spinal Cord Injury 

&#160;

A spinal cord injury, or SCI, usually refers to a traumatic blow to the spine that fractures or dislocates vertebrae and causes damage to the surrounding spinal cord tissue. SCI is caused by traumas such as a motor vehicle accident, a fall, or a sports injury. Depending on the location and severity of the injury, people with SCI can experience a number of disabilities, including partial or complete paralysis, muscle weakness, spasticity, loss or distortion of sensation, impaired bowel and/or bladder function, or sexual dysfunction. SCI often results in severe, lifelong disability, leading to long-term care and quality of life issues for the person with the injury. 

&#160;

Clinical research using imaging and post-mortem studies has shown that the majority of people with SCI do not have severed spinal cords and maintain some nerve fibers that cross the site of injury. However, these surviving nerve fibers are often damaged and may lose their myelin sheaths. There is no cure for SCI and no approved treatment available that is capable of significantly improving outcome from injury or improving long-term neurological function. Methylprednisolone, a steroid given in a high dose, is often used to treat acute injuries in the U.S. Methylprednisolone is administered to the patient immediately following an injury with the goal of reducing secondary tissue damage, but there is disagreement in the clinical community regarding the overall risk-benefit ratio of this treatment. The only other available medical therapies are limited treatments that target some of the symptoms of SCI, including spasticity and persistent pain, the same treatments used to address these symptoms in MS. We believe that an acute treatment that offers even an incremental improvement in outcome from injury could have a meaningful impact on the quality of life for people with SCI. 

&#160;

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, or NSCISC, approximately 270,000 people in the U.S. live with SCI and approximately 12,000 new spinal cord injuries occur each year, the majority 

&#160;

&#160; 

of which are male. SCI primarily affects young people, with nearly half occurring in those aged 16-30. Average annual medical cost for an SCI patient ranges from approximately $40,000 to $180,000 depending on the extent of the injury. NSCISC estimates that the average lifetime costs directly attributable to SCI for an individual injured at age 25 varies from approximately $1.5 million to more than $4.5 million depending on the severity of the injury. 

&#160; 

Heart Failure 

&#160;

Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood through the heart to meet the body's need for blood and oxygen. Heart failure results from damage to heart, caused by trauma such as heart attack or coronary artery disease, viral infections, alcohol or chemotherapy-related toxicity, or added stress to the heart from other health conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Common symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath (dyspnea), persistent coughing or wheezing, build-up of excessive fluid in body tissue that may cause swelling of the feet, ankles, legs and abdomen (edema), and fatigue. Healthcare professionals typically classify heart failure based on the severity of symptoms and how those symptoms limit physical activity. Heart failure can range from no symptoms and no limitations on ordinary physical activity (Class 1) through severe physical limitations with patients experiencing symptoms even while at rest (Class 4). 

&#160;

Existing medications for heart failure aim to compensate for the heart's diminished blood pumping ability. There is evidence that such medications, together with dietary changes, may have a modest indirect impact on the heart, but do not directly repair the heart muscle. 

&#160;

According to the American Heart Association, in 2013 approximately 5.1 million Americans had heart failure, and roughly 825,000 cases are newly diagnosed each year. 

&#160; 

Spasticity 

&#160;

Spasticity refers to the often painful involuntary tensing, stiffening or contracting of muscles. Spasticity is not a disease but a symptom of other conditions, such as MS, SCI, stroke, traumatic brain injury and cerebral palsy, where portions of the nervous system that control voluntary movement have been damaged. This damage results in the nerve cells in the spinal cord becoming disconnected from controlling centers in the brain and, as a result, transmitting unregulated impulses to the muscles. People who have spasticity may experience it intermittently &#8211; it may be triggered by a stimulus, such as pain, pressure sores, cold weather or a urinary tract infection. The majority of people with MS experience some form of spasticity, as do many people following stroke, SCI, or brain injuries. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, spasticity affects more than an estimated 12 million people worldwide. 

&#160;

Neuropathic Pain 

&#160;

There are several underserved neuropathic pain conditions that, together, represent approximately 4 million cases in the U. S. alone. In addition to the current indication for Qutenza, post-herpetic neuralgia, these include painful neuropathies due to diabetes, chemotherapy and HIV/AIDs. 

&#160;

Post-herpetic neuralgia, or PHN, also known as post-shingles nerve pain, is chronic pain resulting from shingles, a viral infection caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. There are approximately one million new cases of shingles in the U.S. each year. Shingles is characterized by an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin and nerve pain that typically resolves within several weeks. However, 10 to 20 percent of patients with shingles will go on to develop PHN, which can continue for months or years after the shingles rash has healed. 

&#160;

Ampyra 

&#160;

Ampyra (dalfampridine) is an oral drug approved by the FDA on January 22, 2010 as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, 

&#160;

&#160; 

progressive relapsing and primary progressive). Ampyra can be used alone or with concurrent medications, including immunomodulatory drugs. The majority of patients in our two Phase 3 clinical trials for Ampyra (63%) were taking immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab). Ampyra is an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), which was previously referred to as fampridine. 

&#160; 

We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, which are described below in the &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; section of this report, providing protection up to 2027. Also, Ampyra has Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for dalfampridine in MS, which will provide Ampyra with seven years of market exclusivity for this use, until January 2017. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from several generic drug manufacturers, and also inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. An adverse outcome in these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange-Book listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen under a 2009 license and collaboration agreement. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2016. 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons through blocking of potassium channels. The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated. 

&#160;

Clinical Studies and Safety Profile 

&#160;

Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Ampyra was based on data from a comprehensive development program assessing the safety and efficacy of Ampyra, including two Phase 3 trials that involved 540 people with MS. T he primary measure of efficacy in our two Phase 3 MS trials was walking speed (in feet per second) as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), using a responder analysis. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double-blind period than the maximum speed achieved in the five non-double-blind, no treatment visits (four before the double-blind period and one after). A significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily were responders compared to patients taking placebo, as measured by the T25FW (Trial 1: 34.8% vs. 8.3%; Trial 2: 42.9% vs. 9.3%). The increased response rate in the Ampyra group was observed across all four major types of MS. During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo. In both trials, the consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug vs. placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure. 

&#160;

In October 2015, we presented 5-year post-marketing safety data for dalfampridine extended release tablets in MS at the 31 st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. The data presented continue to be consistent with those reported in double-blind clinical trials, with incidence of reported seizure remaining stable over time. 

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s approval letter included certain post-marketing study requirements and confirmed certain commitments made by us with respect to Ampyra, all of which we have now completed. The post-marketing requirements included additional animal toxicology studies to evaluate certain impurities, in-vitro receptor binding and abuse potential studies in animals, and an evaluation of clinical adverse events related to abuse 

&#160;

&#160; 

potential. We completed these studies and timely submitted the results to the FDA. Also, we committed to the FDA that we would conduct a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a 5 mg twice-daily dosing regimen of Ampyra, as well as a pharmacokinetic evaluation of a 7.5 mg dosage strength in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. We also committed to report all post-marketing seizure events on an expedited basis to the FDA. We completed the renal impairment study and timely submitted the results to the FDA. We are discussing with the FDA what additional steps may need to be taken. In August 2012, we announced results of the 5mg efficacy study. The study failed to confirm efficacy of the 5mg dose. We believe that this study, together with Ampyra registration studies, continue to show that 10mg twice daily is the appropriate, safe, and effective dose. The study results were provided to the FDA, which subsequently confirmed that we have satisfied this post-marketing requirement. 

&#160; 

In our two Phase 3 clinical studies of Ampyra in spinal cord injury, which were completed in 2004, the results did not reach statistical significance on their primary endpoints. 

&#160;

Zanaflex Products 

&#160;

Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets contain tizanidine hydrochloride, one of the two leading active ingredients used for the management of spasticity. Tizanidine hydrochloride is approved by the FDA as a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. We acquired from Alkermes plc (formerly Elan) all of its U.S. sales, marketing and distribution rights to Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets in July 2004. Zanaflex tablets were approved by the FDA in 1996 and lost compound patent protection in 2002. There are currently a number of generic versions of tizanidine hydrochloride tablets on the market. Zanaflex Capsules were approved by the FDA in 2002, but were never marketed by Elan. We began marketing Zanaflex Capsules in April 2005 as part of our strategy to build a commercial platform for the potential market launch of Ampyra. In February 2012, we launched an authorized generic version of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules under our agreement with an Allergan plc subsidiary (originally Watson Pharma, Inc., now part of the Actavis business owned by Allergan), following the launch by Apotex Inc. of its generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. In March 2013, Mylan Laboratories also launched generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. 

&#160;

Clinical trials conducted by Elan demonstrated that Zanaflex Capsules, when taken with food, produce average peak levels of tizanidine hydrochloride in a person's blood that are lower and rise more gradually compared to the peak levels following a similar dose of the tablet form. The FDA recognizes these pharmacokinetic differences and therefore has determined that Zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are not therapeutically equivalent, that is, are not AB-rated to Zanaflex Capsules. As a result, under state pharmacy laws, prescriptions written for Zanaflex Capsules may not be filled by the pharmacist with Zanaflex tablets or generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets, although some substitution does take place in practice. However, they may be filled with generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules or our authorized generic capsules. 

&#160;

Qutenza is a dermal patch containing 8% prescription strength capsaicin the effects of which can last up to three months and is approved by the FDA for the management of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, also known as post-shingles pain. We acquired commercialization rights to Qutenza in July 2013 from NeurogesX, Inc. These rights include the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. Qutenza was approved by the FDA in 2010 and launched in April 2010 but NeurogesX discontinued active promotion of the product in March 2012. In January 2014, we re-launched Qutenza in the U.S. using our existing commercial organization, including our specialty neurology sales force as well as our medical and safety reporting infrastructure. 

&#160;

Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd. has exclusive commercialization rights for Qutenza in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein as well as Switzerland, certain countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development Programs 

&#160;

We have an industry leading pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including MS, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD), epilepsy and migraine. As further described below, our pipeline includes three late stage programs for which we are expecting important clinical milestones in 2016. 

&#160;

CVT-301, CVT 427 and ARCUS Technology 

&#160;

On October 22, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Civitas&#8221;), a privately-held pharmaceutical company with global rights to CVT-301, a Phase 3 treatment candidate for OFF periods of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, or PD. Our acquisition of Civitas also included rights to Civitas&#8217;s proprietary ARCUS pulmonary delivery technology, which we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. 

&#160;

CVT-301 is an inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease is characterized by symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease is oral levodopa (L-dopa), but there are significant challenges in creating a dosing regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson&#8217;s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remains one of the most challenging aspects of the disease. 

&#160;

CVT-301 is based on the proprietary ARCUS technology platform that we acquired with Civitas. The ARCUS technology is a dry-powder pulmonary delivery system that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. This platform allows delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with conventional dry powder formulations using a simple, patient-friendly, breath-actuated proprietary inhaler. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents. 

&#160;

In December 2014, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 study of CVT-301 for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Our CVT-301 development includes this Phase 3 efficacy trial and safety extension, and two pharmacokinetic studies in specific sub-populations. We expect results from the efficacy trial in the fourth quarter of 2016, and pending timely recruitment for clinical trials, our goal is to file a new drug application, or NDA, in the U.S. by the first quarter of 2017. We expect that the NDA will be filed under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from the branded L-dopa product Sinemet&#174;. Based on Civitas&#8217;s interactions with the FDA, we believe a single Phase 3 efficacy study will be needed for filing an NDA, supported by existing Phase 2b data. A separate long term safety study will also be required. &#160; We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of CVT-301 in the U.S. alone could exceed $500 million. 

&#160;

In June 2015, we presented data from a Phase 2b clinical trial of CVT-301 at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The data showed that patients experiencing an OFF period, treated with CVT-301, experienced significantly greater improvements in motor function than patients treated with an inhaled placebo; the difference in improvement was already apparent 10 minutes after dosing and was durable for at least an hour, the longest time point at which patients were measured. 

&#160;

In addition to CVT-301, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. Disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, in addition to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, may be addressed by ARCUS products with the delivery of active agents to the CNS with rapid onset and reduced systemic exposure. 

&#160; 

For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS delivery system. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in a nasally-delivered formulation. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally-delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. We have selected zolmitriptan as the active ingredient for CVT-427. In December 2015, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of CVT-427 for acute treatment of migraine. We expect to provide an update on this program by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

In July 2015, the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a $1.4 million grant to support the development of a formulation and delivery system for a dry powder version of lung surfactant, a treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS. The formulation will be based on our proprietary ARCUS technology, and will be produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. RDS is a condition affecting newborns in which fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs; it most commonly affects infants born prematurely. It can be fatal, or lead to severe, chronic health issues caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the baby&#8217;s brain and other organs. The syndrome is caused by the infants&#8217; inability to produce enough surfactant, a liquid lining the inside of the lungs. Delivering liquid surfactant to the lungs via intubation is the standard of care. This grant will support the development of a portable and easily administered inhaled form of surfactant, which may present a more practical alternative for use in developing areas of the world, where intubation poses numerous problems. This program is not aimed at developing a commercial product, but our work on this program could potentially generate information that is useful for adapting the ARCUS technology to commercial pediatric uses. 

&#160;

Ampyra/Dalfampridine Development Programs 

&#160;

We believe there may be potential for dalfampridine to be applied to neurological conditions in addition to MS. For example, we are studying the use of dalfampridine in patients who experience chronic post-stroke deficits. Chronic post-stroke deficits refer to neurological deficits, such as impaired walking, motor and/or sensory function, that persist in people who have had a stroke. There are currently no pharmacologic therapies indicated to improve function in people with chronic post-stroke deficits. 

&#160;

In 2013, we announced the results of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of dalfampridine-ER (extended release) in people with post-stroke deficits. The primary goals of the proof-of-concept trial were to assess safety and tolerability, as well as to explore various efficacy measures. In the study, treatment with dalfampridine improved walking, as measured by the Timed 25-Foot Walk test (T25FW). The safety findings in this study were consistent with previous clinical trials and post-marketing experience of dalfampridine-ER (extended release) in MS. 

&#160;

Based on the results of the proof-of-concept trial, we are continuing our post-stroke development program. In December 2014, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the use of dalfampridine administered twice daily (BID) to improve walking in people who are suffering from chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD) after experiencing an ischemic stroke. As part of the trial design, we are planning to conduct an interim analysis of the trial data in the third quarter of 2016. This analysis, combined with the results from our development efforts on a once-daily formulation of dalfampridine (discussed below) will establish the next steps for the program. 

&#160;

We have been exploring a once daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in the post-stroke clinical program. Based on the results of an in-vitro alcohol dose dumping study and a subsequent fed-fasted study, we determined that the initial QD formulation that we had been developing with an external partner was not practical for further testing. We are working with different external partners to develop a new QD formulation that could be included in future post-stroke studies. We currently have three prototypes from three different partners based on in vitro testing, which do not have the alcohol dose dumping issue we identified with the initial QD 

&#160;

&#160; 

formulation. All three prototypes are currently in Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies, and we expect to provide an update on these studies by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

We also are continuing to evaluate possible grants for investigator-initiated studies looking for potential benefits, including in other neurological disorders. 

&#160;

Plumiaz 

&#160;

We are developing Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, for the treatment of people with epilepsy on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, or ARS. Currently, the only approved outpatient treatment for people who experience this type of seizure activity is diazepam rectal gel, a rectally administered gel formulation of diazepam. Diazepam is also currently available in other formulations, such as used for intramuscular and intravenous administration, for certain indications. The nasally administered formulation potentially offers patients and caregivers a more practical and socially acceptable treatment option. 

&#160;

In 2013, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing for Plumiaz to the FDA. Plumiaz was filed under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from a therapy previously approved by the FDA (DIASTAT&#174; Rectal Gel) and providing pharmacokinetic data comparing the reference product to Plumiaz. In May 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Plumiaz NDA. 

&#160;

In May 2015, we announced that we completed discussions with the FDA, and are advancing the development of Plumiaz. Based on these discussions, we are conducting three clinical trials for Plumiaz: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The first trial is a long-term open-label study assessing safety and tolerability of Plumiaz over 52 weeks. This trial will enroll approximately 100 participants ages 12-65. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The second trial is assessing the bioavailability, safety and tolerability of Plumiaz compared to diazepam rectal gel (Diastat&#174;). This open-label, randomized, crossover trial will enroll approximately 120 people with refractory epilepsy ages 12-65 who experience seizure clusters. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The third trial is a pharmacokinetic dose proportionality study in healthy adults. 

&#160;

All three trials have been initiated and are currently enrolling. We are planning to resubmit the NDA for Plumiaz in the first quarter of 2017. Based on FDA guidelines, the expected review period of the resubmitted NDA would be six months. 

&#160;

In December 2015, we presented analyses from a study showing the effect of rescue medication for seizure clusters on both clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. The study found there were more adverse outcomes and greater use of healthcare resources among those who did not always use a rescue medication to treat seizure clusters, compared to those who always used a rescue medication. Seizure clusters are defined as multiple, distinct seizures that occur over a 24-hour period. These analyses were presented at the 69 th Annual Meeting of the American Epilepsy Society. 

&#160;

We have obtained orphan drug designation, which would confer seven years of market exclusivity from the date of approval for diazepam containing drug products for the same indication. We license two patent families relating to the clinical formulation of diazepam nasal spray, including a granted U.S. patent that is set to expire in 2029. We anticipate that our current infrastructure can support sales and marketing of this product if it receives FDA approval. If approved, we project peak U.S. annual net revenue of more than $200 million. 

&#160;

We acquired the Plumiaz program in December 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Neuronex, Inc., a privately-held development stage pharmaceutical company. We completed the acquisition pursuant to a merger agreement with Neuronex and Moise A. Khayrallah, acting as the Stockholders&#8217; Representative on behalf of the former Neuronex equity holders. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the merger agreement 

&#160;

&#160; 

with Mr. Khayrallah, as Stockholders&#8217; Representative. Pursuant to the amendment, the Stockholders&#8217; Representative, acting on behalf of the former Neuronex equity holders, agreed to certain modifications to our future contingent payment obligations regarding the development and potential commercialization of Plumiaz, described below. In consideration of those modifications, pursuant to the amendment we paid the former Neuronex equity holders $8.75 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

Under the merger agreement, the former equity holders of Neuronex will be entitled to receive payments from us, in addition to payments we have already made under the merger agreement, upon the achievement of specified regulatory, manufacturing-related, and sales milestones with respect to Plumiaz. Pursuant to the merger agreement as amended by the amendment, we are obligated to pay (i) up to $3 million in specified regulatory and manufacturing-related milestone payments, a reduction from up to $18 million in such payments that were originally specified in the merger agreement, and (ii) up to $100 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones, a reduction from up to $105 million in such payments that were originally specified in the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, the former equity holders of Neuronex will also be entitled to receive tiered royalty-like earnout payments on worldwide net revenue of Plumiaz, if any. The rates for these payments pursuant to the merger agreement originally ranged from the upper single digits to lower double digits, but were modified pursuant to the amendment and now range from the mid-single digits to mid-double digits. These payments are payable on a country-by-country basis until the earlier to occur of ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country and the entry of generic competition in such country as defined in the merger agreement. 

&#160;

The patent and other intellectual property and other rights relating to Plumiaz are licensed from SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (SK). Pursuant to the SK license, which granted worldwide rights to Neuronex, except certain specified Asian countries, our subsidiary Neuronex is obligated to pay SK up to $8 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones with respect to Plumiaz (including a $1 million payment that was triggered in 2013 upon the FDA&#8217;s acceptance for review of the first NDA for Plumiaz), and up to $3 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones with respect to the diazepam nasal spray product. Also, Neuronex is obligated to pay SK a tiered, mid-single digit royalty on net revenue of Plumiaz. 

&#160;

Under the merger agreement, we are required to use diligent efforts, as defined in the merger agreement, to develop a diazepam nasal spray product. However, we have the right, at any time, to discontinue development and commercialization of the diazepam nasal spray product and return the diazepam nasal spray product assets. If this occurs, we will not have any further diligence obligations regarding the diazepam nasal spray products but will not be entitled to recoup any of the payments previously made under the merger agreement. 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa / Neuregulins 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa is a member of the neuregulin growth factor family, and has been shown to promote recovery after neurological injury, as well as enhance heart function in animal models of heart failure. The neuregulin growth factors are related to epidermal growth factor. These molecules bind to erbB receptors, which translate the growth factor signal and cause changes in cell growth, protein production and gene expression. Neuregulins have been shown in published studies to have a range of effects in protection and repair of cells both in the nervous system and in the heart. In 2002, we obtained from Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc), or Paion, an exclusive worldwide license to its neuregulin patents and related technology, including cimaglermin , our lead molecule from the neuregulin family. 

&#160;

Neuregulins covered in the portfolio from Paion have a number of potential applications. Neuregulins and their erbB receptors are essential for cardiac development. They have been shown to protect cardiac muscle cells from stressors that can lead to congestive heart failure, and to enhance function in heart failure induced by myocardial infarction. Additionally, neuregulins have been shown to protect the heart and brain from the toxicity of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines. Studies in mouse, rat and dog models of congestive heart failure have shown that neuregulins significantly improve cardiac function and survival. Neuregulins have been shown to stimulate remyelination in animal models of MS and to protect the brain in 

&#160;

&#160; 

animal models of stroke. Therefore, neuregulins offer the potential for multiple central nervous system and cardiac indications, including MS, stroke and heart failure as well as protection from chemotherapy-induced damage. 

&#160; 

We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of cimaglermin in heart failure patients. This was a dose-escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose, with follow-up assessments at one, three, and six months. In March 2013, we presented three-month data from this clinical trial in a platform presentation at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) annual meeting. Data from this trial showed a dose-related improvement in ejection fraction in addition to safety findings. A dose-limiting toxicity was also identified in the highest planned dose cohort, specifically acute liver injury meeting Hy&#8217;s Law for drug induced hepatotoxicity, which resolved within several days. In March 2015, we presented new analyses of data from this trial at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 64 th Annual Scientific Session and Expo. These analyses found that cimaglermin produced a dose-dependent benefit at multiple time points for up to three months following a single infusion. 

&#160;

In October 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in a second clinical trial of cimaglermin . This Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure is assessing tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin , which were tested in the first trial, and also includes assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. We selected heart failure as the initial indication because of the strength of the preclinical data, the availability of clear outcome measures, and the potential market size. We voluntarily paused enrollment in this trial in December 2013 pending review of additional non-clinical data with the FDA. In April 2014, we announced that we had completed this review and recruitment was thereafter resumed. &#160; In June 2015 we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) meeting Hy&#8217;s Law criteria (elevated ALT, AST and bilirubin), based on blood test results. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information, and the trial remains subject to this clinical hold. The abnormal blood tests resolved within several days, as was the case with the one Hy&#8217;s Law case reported in the previous Phase 1 study noted above. The 22 patients who were dosed in the trial will complete the pre-planned one year of follow up. Outside of the hepatoxicity case, the safety profile from this trial was consistent with our first Phase 1 trial, but efficacy data was inconclusive which we believe was in part due to the very small number of patients in the trial. We have ongoing analyses and non-clinical studies to investigate the biological basis for liver effects, and we will need to meet with the FDA to review these and other data from the cimaglermin studies and to request that the program be removed from clinical hold. 

&#160;

If we are able to establish a proof of concept for treatment of heart failure through human clinical studies, we may decide to develop the product independently or we may decide to enter into a partnership, most likely with a cardiovascular-focused company. We are also continuing with research on potential neurology indications for cimaglermin . 

&#160;

Remyelinating Antibodies Program 

&#160;

Our remyelinating antibodies program is based on our research collaboration with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic. Under a license agreement entered into with Mayo Clinic in September 2000, we have exclusive worldwide rights to patents and other intellectual property for these antibodies related to nervous system disorders. Studies have demonstrated the ability of this family of antibodies to stimulate repair of the myelin sheath in three different animal models of MS. In particular, these antibodies were found to react with molecules on the surface of the cells that make the myelin sheath and stimulate them, leading to increased remyelination activity. Some antibodies within this portfolio also stimulate the growth of neurons and may have applications beyond demyelinating disorders. First identified in mice, similar remyelinating antibodies were subsequently identified in human blood samples by Mayo Clinic and we have been able to produce a recombinant human antibody (rHIgM22) that may be suitable for clinical development. 

&#160;

rHIgM22 is the lead antibody in our remyelinating antibody program. We are developing rHIgM22 as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore 

&#160;

&#160; 

neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. In April 2013, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of rHIgM22 to assess the safety and tolerability of rHIgM22 in patients with MS. The study also included several exploratory clinical, imaging and biomarker measures. &#160; We announced top-line safety and tolerability results in February 2015. The trial, which followed participants for up to six months after receiving a single dose of rHIgM22, found no dose-limiting toxicities at any of the five dose levels studied. In April 2015, we presented additional safety data from this trial at the 67th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. The additional data showed that rHIgM22 was well tolerated in each of the five doses, supporting additional clinical development. In October 2015, we presented pharmacokinetics from the trial in patients with stable MS, confirming that rHIgM22 penetrates the central nervous system. This data was presented at the 31st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis annual meeting. We are advancing clinical development of rHIgM22 for MS. 

&#160; 

We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect to complete the trial in the first half of 2017. 

&#160;

Chondroitinase Program 

&#160;

This pre-clinical program is focused on developing chondroitinase as a therapeutic to break down the matrix of scar tissue that develops as a result of an injury to the central nervous system, or CNS. Published research has demonstrated that this scar matrix is partly responsible for limiting the regeneration of nerve fibers in the CNS. A similar matrix exists even in uninjured parts of the CNS tissue and restricts plasticity, the ability to modify or re-establish nerve connections. One or both forms of matrix may also inhibit repair of the myelin sheath by restricting the movements of the myelinating cells into the area of damage. 

&#160;

A major component of these two forms of matrix are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, or CSPGs. Cell culture studies and a number of animal studies have shown that these CSPGs inhibit the growth of nerve fibers and are likely to be key factors in the failure of the spinal cord or brain to regenerate and repair. Studies also have shown that bacterial enzymes called chondroitinases break down the CSPG molecules, thereby reducing their inhibitory activity. 

&#160;

At least six independent laboratories have published animal studies showing that application of chondroitinase results in improved recovery of function following injuries to various areas of the brain or spinal cord. These functions have included walking, forelimb grasping, sensation, and visual and bladder function. We have successfully tested the ability of one of these molecules, Chondroitinase ABC-I, to improve function in an animal model of spinal cord injury. These studies were published in the Journal of Neurotrauma in February 2005. In these studies, rats that sustained a spinal cord injury were treated with either chondroitinase or an ineffective enzyme control and evaluated over 10 weeks of recovery. Animals treated with chondroitinase showed significant improvements both in motor function of the limbs and in bladder function, compared to those treated with the control enzyme. We have also produced and successfully tested a recombinant version of naturally occurring Chondroitinase ABC-I in these same animal models. 

&#160;

We are conducting a research program to develop second generation approaches to overcoming the proteoglycan matrix. Our research is currently focused on spinal cord injury but we are also looking at other neurotraumatic indications. The approaches we are developing include novel enzyme molecules and alternative approaches to blocking matrix formation. In 2003, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents, patent applications, and technology from Cambridge Enterprise Limited (formerly Cambridge University Technical Services Limited) and King&#8217;s College London related to our chondroitinase program. We are also building our intellectual property position with respect to this technology with patent applications around uses of the known compound and new chemical structures. 

&#160;

&#160; 

NP-1998 

&#160;

NP-1998 is a Phase 3 ready, 20% prescription strength capsaicin topical solution that we were assessing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. We acquired rights to NP-1998 from NeurogesX, Inc. in 2013 in connection with our purchase of Qutenza, an FDA-approved dermal patch containing 8% prescription strength capsaicin. We acquired development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd. has an option to develop NP-1998 in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein as well as Switzerland certain countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

&#160;

We made certain upfront payments to acquire the Qutenza and NP-1998 assets from NeurogesX, and may also make up to $5.0 million in payments contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to NP-1998. We believe this liquid formulation of the capsaicin-based therapy has key advantages over the Qutenza patch, and we believe NP-1998 has the potential to treat multiple neuropathies. However, we have no current plans to invest in further development of NP-1998 for neuropathic pain. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Managed Markets 

&#160;

Ampyra 

&#160;

We have established our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to market Ampyra. We currently have approximately 90 sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately 7,000 physicians. We also have established teams of Medical Science Liaisons, Regional Reimbursement Directors, and Managed Markets Account Directors who provide information and assistance to payers and physicians on Ampyra; National Trade Account Managers who work with our limited network of specialty pharmacies; and Market Development Managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of our strategic initiatives. 

&#160;

Our First Step program which provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. During 2015, on average more than 70% of new Ampyra patients enrolled in First Step. The program is in its fifth year, and data show that First Step participants have higher compliance and persistency rates over time compared to non-First Step patients. Approximately 50% of patients who initiate therapy with the First Step free trial program convert to paid prescriptions. 

&#160;

We have contracted with a third-party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run Ampyra Patient Support Services, or APSS, a dedicated resource of support services that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers, people with MS and insurance carriers. Prescriptions for Ampyra are processed through the APSS center, where dedicated and experienced customer care agents are responsible for helping healthcare professionals process prescriptions; working with insurance carriers to facilitate coverage; and working with a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication directly to a patient&#8217;s home. In addition, APSS assists in directing patients to available copay and patient assistance programs, where permitted by law. The process begins when a prescription is submitted by a physician to APSS through a Service Request Form, or SRF. Processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by APSS begins within 24 hours of receipt. Patients will experience a range of time to receive their first shipment based on the processing times for insurance requirements. As with any prescription product, patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription. If insurance coverage is confirmed, APSS will transmit the prescription information to the specialty pharmacy provider that has contracted with the patient&#8217;s insurance carrier. The specialty pharmacy provider will then mail the prescription directly to the patient. In some cases, the specialty pharmacy provider will coordinate the insurance benefits investigation on behalf of the patient or will receive a prescription directly from a prescribing physician. Those people with MS who meet income and other requirements may receive Ampyra at no cost, where permitted by law, through Acorda&#8217;s patient assistance program. We have also established a program to assist individuals who have private insurance in managing their copayment costs through 

&#160;

&#160; 

a copay mitigation program, where permitted by law. 

&#160; 

We believe that, in general, people with MS are knowledgeable about their conditions, actively seek new treatments, and are directly involved with their prescriber's evaluation of treatment options. We have existing relationships with the major advocacy groups that focus on MS. As an example of our commitment, each year Acorda sponsors numerous National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Walk MS events around the country. These sponsorships allow us to engage thousands of people with MS, as well as their families, physicians and caregivers, in a discussion about the impact of walking impairment on their lives. In addition to these efforts, we have implemented a comprehensive series of educational and promotional programs to support Ampyra. 

&#160;

Ampyra is distributed in the U.S. exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients by mail; Kaiser Permanente, which distributes Ampyra to patients through a closed network of on-site pharmacies; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an AmerisourceBergen affiliate), which distributes Ampyra to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, and other federal agencies. The distribution process through specialty pharmacy providers is well established within the MS community, and physicians and patients are familiar with this model. This distribution process is intended to provide the best possible patient experience, improve patient adherence to the required drug regimen, including dosage, and assist in educating patients regarding the risks associated with Ampyra. All of these customers are contractually obligated to hold no more than an agreed number of days of inventory, ranging from 10 to 30 calendar days. 

&#160;

Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. &#8211; Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare &#8211; have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA&#8217;s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans. 

&#160;

Zanaflex 

&#160;

Zanaflex Capsules are principally distributed through wholesale pharmaceutical distributors to retail pharmacies. Our authorized generic version of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is marketed under our agreement with an Allergan plc subsidiary (originally Watson Pharma, Inc., now part of the Actavis business owned by Allergan). 

&#160;

Qutenza 

&#160;

Qutenza is distributed in the U.S. by Besse Medical, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to physician offices, and by ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to hospitals and clinics. As a product that must be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting , many commercial health plans and government insurance programs reimburse for Qutenza under the patient&#8217;s medical benefit rather than the patient&#8217;s pharmacy benefit. As a result of this, most utilization of Qutenza is handled on a &#8220;buy-and-bill&#8221; basis in which one of the distributors listed above (Besse Medical, Inc. or ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc.) ships the medication to a physician&#8217;s office, hospital or clinic to be administered. In those limited number of cases where a payer covers the medication under a patient&#8217;s pharmacy benefit, a specialty pharmacy purchases Qutenza from ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., and then ships the medication directly to the physician&#8217;s office, rather than dispensing Qutenza to the patient. 

&#160;

CVT-301 

&#160;

We anticipate an incremental expansion of our sales force if CVT-301 is approved. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Scientific and Medical Network 

&#160;

We have an established advisory team and network of well-recognized scientists, clinicians and opinion leaders in relevant fields, including for example the fields of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, epilepsy, stroke, and heart failure. Depending on their expertise, these advisors provide assistance in trial design, conduct clinical trials, keep us apprised of the latest scientific advances and help us identify and evaluate business development opportunities. 

&#160;

Material and Other Collaborations and License Agreements 

&#160;

Biogen (Fampyra) 

&#160;

In 2009, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which we and Biogen have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of products containing aminopyridines, including Ampyra, initially directed to the treatment of MS (licensed products). The Collaboration Agreement includes a sublicense of our rights under an existing license agreement with Alkermes (formerly Elan). We have also entered into a related Supply Agreement pursuant to which we supply Biogen with its requirements for the licensed products through our existing supply agreement with Alkermes. Biogen Inc., the parent of Biogen, has guaranteed the performance of Biogen's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement. 

&#160;

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen, itself or through its affiliates, has the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the U.S., while we retain the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in the U.S. Each party has the exclusive right to develop licensed products for its commercialization territory, although the parties may also decide to jointly carry out mutually agreed future development activities &#8211; including, for example, for our development of dalfampridine in chronic post-stroke walking deficits &#8211; under a cost-sharing arrangement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we participate in overseeing the development and commercialization of Ampyra and other licensed products in markets outside the U.S. in part through our participation in joint committees with Biogen. If Biogen does not participate in the development of licensed products for certain indications or forms of administration, it may lose the right to develop and commercialize the licensed products for such indication or form of administration. Biogen may sublicense its rights to certain unaffiliated distributors. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement and for two years after the Collaboration Agreement terminates, neither party nor its affiliates may, other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any competing product, defined as one that contains aminopyridine or any other compound that acts at least in part through direct interaction with potassium channels to improve neurological function in MS, SCI or other demyelinating conditions, except that we may exploit the licensed products anywhere in the world following termination of the Collaboration Agreement. 

&#160;

Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen. &#160; Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2016. 

&#160;

In consideration for the rights granted to Biogen under the Collaboration Agreement, we were entitled to a non-refundable upfront payment of $110.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was received in July 2009. Also, in August 2011, we received a $25 million milestone payment from Biogen for approval of Fampyra in the EU. Under our separate license and supply agreements with Alkermes, in 2009 we paid Alkermes $7.7 million of the $110 million upfront Biogen payment and in 2011 we paid Alkermes $1.8 million of the $25 million Biogen milestone payment. We are entitled to receive additional payments from Biogen of up to $10 million based on the successful achievement of future regulatory milestones and up to $365 million based on the successful achievement of future sales milestones. The next expected milestone payment from Biogen would be $15 million, due when ex-U.S. net sales exceed $100 million over four consecutive quarters. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of licensed products by Biogen, its affiliates or certain distributors outside of the U.S. Such royalties for products combining a licensed compound with at least one other clinically active therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic ingredient are determined based on the contribution of the licensed compound to the overall sales or value of the combination product. Biogen may offset against the royalties payable to us a portion of certain royalties that it may need to pay to third parties. 

&#160;

Biogen exclusively purchases all of Biogen's, its affiliates' and its sublicensees' requirements of the licensed products from us. The purchase price paid by Biogen for licensed products under the Collaboration Agreement and Supply Agreement reflects the prices owed to our suppliers under our supply arrangements with Alkermes or other suppliers. In addition, Biogen pays us, in consideration for its purchase and sale of the licensed products, any amounts due to Alkermes for ex-U.S. sales, including royalties owed under the terms of our existing agreements with Alkermes. 

&#160;

The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Biogen's royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the latest of expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product, fifteen years following first commercial sale of such licensed product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and the existence of certain levels of sales by competing products. The Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement will automatically terminate upon the termination of our license agreement with Alkermes in its entirety or with respect to all countries outside of the U.S. We cannot terminate our license agreement with Alkermes without Biogen's prior written consent under certain circumstances. Biogen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis at any time upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to our right to accelerate such termination. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the agreement, which termination will be limited to a particular country or region under certain circumstances. However, if Biogen has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our material uncured breach, Biogen may instead elect to keep the agreement in effect, but decrease the royalty rates they pay us by a specified percentage. We may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement if Biogen does not commercially launch a licensed product within a specified time period after receiving regulatory approval for such licensed product or otherwise fails to meet certain commercialization obligations. In addition, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement under certain circumstances if (i) Biogen, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenge certain of our patents or (ii) there is a change in control of Biogen or its parent company or certain dispositions of assets by Biogen, its parent or its affiliated companies, followed by a change in the sales and marketing personnel responsible for the licensed products in Biogen's territory of more than a specified percentage within a certain period of time after such change in control or disposition. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and the Collaboration Agreement will terminate automatically if the Supply Agreement is terminated for any reason other than for a material breach that we are responsible for. To the extent permitted by law, each party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement if the other party is subject to bankruptcy proceedings. 

&#160;

If the Supply Agreement is terminated by Biogen for an uncured material breach, we will waive our right for Alkermes to exclusively supply the licensed products to us solely to permit Biogen to negotiate terms with Alkermes for the supply of licensed products to Biogen. If the Supply Agreement is otherwise terminated, Biogen will not have any future obligations to purchase licensed products from us and we will not have any future obligations to supply Biogen with licensed products. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, Biogen will assign to us all regulatory documentation and other information necessary or useful to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries and will grant us a license under Biogen's and its affiliates' relevant patent rights, know-how and trademarks to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries. Such assignment and license will be at no cost to us unless the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by Biogen for a material uncured breach that we are responsible for, in which case the parties will negotiate a payment to Biogen to reflect the net value of such assigned and licensed rights. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Neither party may assign the agreements without the prior written consent of the other, except to an affiliate or, in certain cases, to a third party acquirer of the party. 

&#160;

In connection with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen and Alkermes entered into a Consent Agreement with us. Under the Consent Agreement, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of rights to Biogen, and the three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under our agreements with Alkermes with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors; permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities; and, requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances. 

&#160;

Alkermes (Ampyra and Zanaflex) 

&#160;

We have entered into agreements with Elan Corporation plc, including those described immediately below and elsewhere in this report. In September 2011, Alkermes plc acquired Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business and Elan transferred our agreements to Alkermes as part of that transaction. Throughout this report, references to &#8220;Alkermes&#8221; include Alkermes plc and also, as the context may require, Elan Corporation plc as the predecessor to Alkermes plc under our agreements. 

&#160;

Ampyra 

&#160;

In September 2003, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Elan that replaced two prior license agreements for Ampyra in oral sustained release dosage form. Under this agreement, Elan granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Ampyra for all indications, including SCI, MS and all other indications. We agreed to pay Elan milestone payments of up to $15.0 million, of which we have reached and paid $5.0 million, and royalties based on net sales of products with dalfampridine as the active ingredient. We also agreed to pay Elan 7% of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to Ampyra or other aminopyridine products. As a result of our Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, described above, in 2009 we paid Elan $7.7 million of a $110 million upfront payment we received from Biogen, and in 2011 we paid Elan $1.8 million of a $25 million milestone payment we received from Biogen . 

&#160;

Alkermes (now the licensor under this agreement due to its 2011 acquisition of Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business) is also obligated under this agreement to supply us with our commercial requirements for Ampyra in the U.S., as well as to supply Biogen under the Supply Agreement and Consent Agreement with Fampyra for Biogen&#8217;s clinical trials and for Biogen&#8217;s commercial requirements. 

&#160;

Alkermes may terminate our license in countries in which we have a license, if we fail to file for regulatory approvals within a commercially reasonable time after completion and receipt of positive data from all preclinical and clinical studies required for the related NDA equivalent. We could also lose our rights under the license agreement if we fail to launch a product in such countries within 180 days of NDA or equivalent approval and receipt of other needed regulatory approvals, or if we fail to fulfill our payment obligations under the license agreement. If Alkermes terminates our license in any applicable country, Alkermes is entitled to license from us our patent rights and know-how relating to the product and to market the product in the applicable country, subject to royalty payments to us. 

&#160;

We have the right to terminate the Alkermes license at any time by written notice. In addition, the Alkermes license may be immediately terminated by either party following an incurable breach of any term or provision by the other party. The Alkermes license may also be terminated by either party following notice and the expiration of a cure period with respect to an uncured breach by either party. 

&#160;

Subject to the early termination provisions, the Alkermes license terminates on a country-by-country basis 

&#160;

&#160; 

on the last to occur of fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018), the expiration of the last to expire Alkermes patent or the existence of competition in that country. 

&#160; 

Zanaflex 

&#160;

In July 2004, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Elan pursuant to which we acquired all of Elan&#8217;s research, development, distribution, sales and marketing rights to Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets in the U.S. The assets acquired include the products' FDA registrations and FDA dossiers, proprietary product know-how, a patent and two related patent applications, certain inventory of Zanaflex tablets and certain product books and records. Elan also granted us a license allowing us to use the Zanaflex trademarks in the U.S., with the right to buy the Zanaflex trademark for a nominal sum once specified milestone and royalty payments were made. Those payments have been made, and we purchased and now own the trademarks. Elan also granted us an exclusive, perpetual and royalty-free license to certain intellectual property relating to technology contained in Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets or used in the manufacture of Zanaflex Capsules, for use in connection with the sale and marketing of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets in the U.S. We also acquired the right to develop new indications, formulations, dosage forms, delivery systems and process improvements of Zanaflex. Under the agreement, Elan agreed not to directly or indirectly market, distribute or sell any products containing tizanidine as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in the U.S. until the later of the end of our obligation to pay royalties to Elan or valid termination of our supply agreement with Elan. In addition, we agreed not to directly or indirectly market, distribute or sell any products containing tizanidine as its active pharmaceutical ingredient in the United Kingdom or Ireland until July 2007. 

&#160;

Our agreement with Elan obligated us to pay a combination of sales-based milestone payments of up to $19.5 million, all of which have been achieved and were paid prior to our 2011 fiscal year, and royalties on sales of Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets. We have no further Zanaflex milestone payment obligations to Elan or Alkermes (which has acquired Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business). We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Zanaflex Capsules. 

&#160;

As part of the acquisition, we assumed certain of Elan&#8217;s rights and obligations relating to Zanaflex under a license agreement with Novartis, to the extent that these rights and obligations arise subsequent to our acquisition of Zanaflex. Under this agreement we obtained certain rights to market and sell tizanidine products and rights to product improvements developed by Novartis. 

&#160;

Alkermes manufactures Zanaflex Capsules for us ( and the authorized generic version of Zanaflex capsules being marketed by an Allergan plc subsidiary as part of its Actavis business, originally Watson Pharma, Inc.) and Patheon Inc. manufactures Zanaflex tablets for us. For more information refer to "&#8212;Manufacturing." 

&#160;

In December 2005, we entered into a financing arrangement with Paul Royalty Fund, or PRF, pursuant to which we assigned PRF the right to receive a portion of our net revenues from Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and any future Zanaflex products. This agreement was amended in November 2006 potentially to increase the total amount of royalty payments to which PRF is entitled and to provide for additional lump-sum payments both from us to PRF and from PRF to us. The arrangement covers all Zanaflex net revenues generated from October 1, 2005 through and including December 31, 2015, unless the arrangement is terminated earlier. &#160; In November 2014, PRF sold its Zanaflex revenue interest to another party, and in connection with our consenting to that transaction PRF released us from claims it had previously asserted regarding our alleged non-compliance with the terms of the financing arrangement. For more information on our arrangement with PRF, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Financing Arrangements." 

&#160;

Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center (dalfampridine) 

&#160;

In 1990, Elan licensed from Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, or Rush, know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS. We subsequently licensed this know-how from Elan. In September 2003, 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

we entered into an agreement with Rush and Elan terminating the Rush license to Elan and providing for mutual releases. We also entered into a license agreement with Rush in 2003 in which Rush granted us an exclusive worldwide license to its know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS. Rush has also assigned to us its Orphan Drug Designation for dalfampridine for the relief of symptoms of MS. 

&#160; 

We agreed to pay Rush a license fee, milestone payments of up to $850,000 and royalties based on net sales of the product for neurological indications. We have made or accrued an aggregate of $850,000 in milestone payments and $37.4 million in royalties under this agreement through December 31, 2015. In 2014, with our consent Rush sold its right to receive these royalties along with certain related rights to a third party, though this transfer did not materially change any of our obligations under the license. The FDA approval of Ampyra triggered the final milestone of $750,000, which was paid in 2010. The Rush license may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party and notice. The Rush license may also be terminated upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other party. We also entered into an agreement with Elan relating to the allocation of payments between us and Elan of certain payments to Rush under the Rush license. Subject to the early termination provisions, the Rush license terminates upon expiration of the royalty obligations, which expire fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018). 

&#160;

Alkermes (ARCUS products) 

&#160; 

On December 27, 2010, Civitas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an &#160; Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Alkermes, Inc. pursuant to which Alkermes assigned, sold and transferred to Civitas certain of its rights in certain pulmonary delivery patents and patents applications, certain equipment and instruments relating to pulmonary drug delivery, copies of certain documents and reports relating to pulmonary delivery, certain pulmonary drug delivery inhalers and certain pulmonary drug delivery INDs filed with the FDA. Alkermes also granted to Civitas a non-exclusive sublicense to know-how for the purpose of development and commercialization of ARCUS products. Civitas is permitted to license and sublicense the pulmonary patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain restrictions, as necessary for our business. Without the prior written consent of Alkermes, Civitas is prohibited from assigning the intellectual property acquired from Alkermes, except to an affiliate or to a person that acquires all or substantially all of its business to which the agreement relates, whether by acquisition, sale, merger or otherwise. 

&#160;

Civitas is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ARCUS products. Civitas is obligated to pay to Alkermes royalties for each licensed product. For licensed products sold by Civitas or an affiliate, Civitas will pay Alkermes a royalty in the mid-single digit percentages in the aggregate. For licensed products sold by a collaboration partner, Civitas will pay Alkermes the lower of either (1) a royalty in the mid-single digit percentage of net sales of licensed products in any given year, or (2) a percentage in the low-to-mid-double digits of all collaboration partner revenue received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the royalty paid be less than a low-single digit percentage of net sales of a licensed product in any given calendar year. Civitas must pay these royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of: (1) the expiration of all patents acquired pursuant to the Alkermes agreement containing valid claims covering such licensed products in such country, or (2) a certain number of years after the launch of such licensed product in each specific country. 

&#160;

The Alkermes agreement remains in effect until expiration of Civitas&#8217;s royalty obligations to Alkermes. Royalties are payable to Alkermes on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the patents acquired from Alkermes containing a valid claim covering a product in a particular country and (ii) 12 years and six months after the launch of a product in a country. Either party may terminate the agreement for default of the other party. Civitas may terminate the Alkermes agreement for convenience upon 90 days&#8217; prior written notice to Alkermes. 

&#160; 

SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Plumiaz) 

&#160; 

In December 2012, we acquired Neuronex, Inc., a privately-held pharmaceutical company developing Plumiaz (our trade name for diazepam nasal spray). Plumiaz is a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam that we are developing as a treatment for selected, refractory patients with epilepsy, on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, who experience bouts of increased seizure activity also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, or ARS. Currently, the only approved outpatient treatment for people who experience this type of seizure activity is diazepam rectal gel, a rectally administered gel formulation of diazepam. Diazepam is also currently available in other formulations, such as used for intramuscular and intravenous administration, for certain indications. The nasally administered formulation potentially offers patients and caregivers a more practical and socially acceptable treatment option. 

&#160;

Neuronex, now one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, licenses patent, patent application, other intellectual property and other rights relating to diazepam nasal spray products from SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or SK. Under the SK license agreement, Neuronex has a license to develop and commercialize licensed products in all countries worldwide, except for specified Asian countries which are reserved for SK under the license agreement. The license is exclusive for all therapeutic, medical and in vivo uses in humans or animals. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the SK license, Neuronex is obligated to pay SK up to $8 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones with respect to diazepam nasal spray products (including a $1 million payment that was paid during the three-month period ending September 30, 2013 upon the FDA&#8217;s acceptance for review of the first NDA for Plumiaz), and up to $3 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones with respect to diazepam nasal spray products. There can be no guarantee that any such milestones, other than the milestone based on the FDA&#8217;s acceptance of the NDA, will in fact be met. Also, Neuronex is obligated to pay SK a tiered, mid-single digit royalty on net sales of diazepam nasal spray products. Neuronex may offset, against a portion of the royalties payable to SK, a portion of any royalties we may pay under certain third party licenses. 

&#160; 

Under the license agreement, Neuronex must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market a diazepam nasal spray product. Also, Neuronex is obligated to achieve specified development milestones within the timeframes specified in the SK license. SK is entitled to terminate the SK license if Neuronex fails to achieve the specified milestones, unless the failure is due to reasons beyond Neuronex&#8217;s reasonable control. 

&#160;

The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Neuronex&#8217;s royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a country-by-country basis, upon the latest of (a) ten years after first commercial sale of diazepam nasal spray product in a country, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity of diazepam nasal spray product in a country, and (c) the expiration of the last-to expire licensed patent. Because the date of the first commercial sale of a licensed product is uncertain, and because patent applications are pending that, if issued, would extend the term of the SK license, the term of the SK license in each country is uncertain. Upon termination of all royalty obligations for a licensed product in a country, the license becomes fully paid-up and non-exclusive. 

&#160; 

The SK license may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party. Also, Neuronex may terminate the SK license at will upon prior written notice to SK. 

&#160;

Neither party may assign the SK license without the prior written consent of the other, except for assignments to affiliates that meet specified conditions. 

&#160; 

Other License Agreements 

&#160;

In addition to the material license and collaboration agreements described above, we have entered into numerous other license agreements to support our research and development programs. These other license agreements include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a mutual, exclusive cross license and coordination agreement with Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd., which we entered into in connection with our acquisition of Qutenza and NP-1998, pursuant to which the parties may share certain data and may collaborate and/or share costs of future clinical trials relating to these products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Canadian Spinal Research Organization for specified patents and know-how relating to the use of dalfampridine in the reduction of chronic pain and spasticity in a spinal cord injured subject. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have an exclusive, worldwide license from Cambridge Enterprise Limited (formerly Cambridge University Technical Services Limited) and King's College London to specified patents and patent applications for products related to enzymatic methods, including chondroitinase, of treating central nervous system disorders. Under the same license, we also have non-exclusive rights to these patents and patent applications for products related to small molecule inhibitors for use in treating central nervous system disorders. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Mayo Foundation for Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic, to specified patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property on certain antibodies relating to our research on the therapeutic use of these antibodies, specifically myelination and remyelination in MS and spinal cord injury. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc) to certain patents, patent applications and know-how relating to cimaglermin alfa or fragments thereof and non-protein products developed through the use of material covered by a valid claim in the patents. The license to these patents and the right to sub-license these patents were granted to Paion by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. We also have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from Paion to certain Paion patents, patent applications, and know-how relating to the neuregulin growth factor gene NRG-2. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a license from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, Inc., or Brigham, acting on its own behalf and on behalf of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, or Beth Israel, to patent rights relating to the use of cimaglermin in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Our rights in the U.S. are co-exclusive, with Brigham and Beth Israel having retained rights for internal research, clinical, and education purposes, and our rights outside the U.S are exclusive. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160;

Ampyra 

&#160;

We are party to a September 2003 agreement with Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes&#8217;s 2011 acquisition of Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business) for our clinical and commercial supply of Ampyra. Under that agreement, we are required to purchase at least 75% of our annual commercial requirements of Ampyra from Alkermes unless Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements. In addition, the agreement also obligates us to make compensatory payments if we do not purchase 100% of our requirements from Alkermes. 

&#160;

As permitted by our agreement with Alkermes, we have designated Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturing source of Ampyra. In connection with that designation, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon, and Alkermes assisted us in transferring manufacturing technology to Patheon. We and Alkermes have agreed that we may purchase up to 25% of our annual requirements from Patheon if we make compensatory payments to Alkermes. In addition, Patheon may supply us with Ampyra if Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements. 

&#160;

Under a Consent Agreement among Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes&#8217;s acquisition of Elan&#8217;s 

&#160;

&#160; 

Drug Technologies business), Biogen and us, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of our rights under our agreements with Alkermes to Biogen. The three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under these agreements with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors, permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities, and requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

Regis Technologies, Inc. is the sole supplier of 4-aminopyridine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ampyra. If Regis experiences any disruption in their operations, a delay or interruption in the supply of our Ampyra product could result until Regis cures the problem or we locate an alternate source of supply. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements on terms that are commercially favorable, if at all. Any new supplier would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. We could experience substantial delays before we are able to qualify any new supplier. 

&#160;

Zanaflex 

&#160;

We rely on Alkermes to supply us under our 2004 Supply Agreement with Zanaflex Capsules ( and for the supply of our authorized generic Zanaflex capsules being marketed by an Allergan plc subsidiary as part of its Actavis business (originally Watson Pharma, Inc.). Patheon is our sole manufacturer of Zanaflex tablets. Farmak a.s. is the sole supplier of tizanidine hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets. 

&#160;

The Zanaflex supply agreement with Alkermes has two year terms that automatically renew unless the agreement is terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement by notifying the other party at least 12 months prior to the expiration of a renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement if the other party commits a material breach that remains uncured. If a failure to supply occurs under the agreement, other than a force majeure event, or if we terminate the supply agreement for cause, Alkermes must use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in transferring production of Zanaflex Capsules to us or a third-party manufacturer, provided that such third party is not a technological competitor of Alkermes. If we need to transfer production, Alkermes has agreed to grant us a royalty-free, fully paid-up license of its manufacturing know-how and other information and rights related to the production of Zanaflex Capsules, including a license to use its technology for specified purposes. We have the right to sublicense this know-how to a third party manufacturer, provided that this third party is not a technological competitor of Alkermes. In the event of termination of the supply agreement due to a force majeure event that continues for more than three months, Alkermes has agreed to enter into negotiations with us to preserve the continuity of supply of products, including the possibility of transferring manufacturing of Zanaflex Capsules to us or a third party manufacturer. 

&#160;

If Alkermes, Patheon, or Farmak experiences any disruption in their operations, a delay or interruption in the supply of our Zanaflex products could result until the affected supplier cures the problem or we locate an alternate source of supply. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements on terms that are commercially favorable, if at all. Any new supplier would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. We could experience substantial delays before we are able to qualify any new supplier and transfer the required manufacturing technology to that supplier. 

&#160;

Qutenza 

&#160;

We acquired Qutenza from NeurogesX in 2013. NeurogesX had discontinued active promotion of Qutenza by the time of our purchase, but we re-launched the product in January 2014 using our existing commercial organization, including our specialty neurology sales force. We rely on third parties to manufacture Qutenza patches, to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient and inactive ingredients, and to package the product. We currently have a contract with the Qutenza patch manufacturer and the supplier of the gel used with the patches but not the supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredient or the packager. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Post-Stroke/Dalfampridine 

&#160;

In December 2014, we announced that the first patient has been enrolled in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the use of dalfampridine administered twice-daily (BID) to improve walking in people who are suffering from chronic post-stroke walking deficits (PSWD) after experiencing an ischemic stroke. 

&#160;

We have been exploring a once-daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in the post-stroke clinical program. Based on the results of an in vitr o alcohol dose dumping study and a subsequent fed-fasted study, we determined that the initial QD formulation that we had been developing with an external partner was not practical for further testing. We are working with different external partners to develop a new QD formulation that could be included in future post-stroke studies. We currently have three prototypes from three different partners based on in vitro testing, which do not have the alcohol dose dumping issue we identified with the initial QD formulation. All three prototypes are currently in Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies, and we expect to provide an update on these studies by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

We have granted Alkermes plc a right of first refusal to be our primary commercial supplier of the initial QD formulation. Should we complete development of and receive FDA approval for the initial QD formulation, we may owe royalties on sales of the product to the development company under our agreements with them. In such event, we would also owe royalties to Alkermes on sales of the product under our existing agreements with Alkermes. 

&#160;

CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology 

&#160; 

Our acquisition of Civitas included its 90,000 square foot subleased manufacturing facility located in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The facility was built specifically for the commercial-scale manufacture of ARCUS products. Prior to Civitas&#8217;s acquisition of this facility from Alkermes, the facility produced more than 36 million human doses of ARCUS-based products for use in clinical trials by Alkermes&#8217;s collaborator in indications other than Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Civitas subsequently took steps to recommission the facility, which has been certified by the EU regulatory authority (known as the Qualified Person, or QP, audit). Civitas has produced current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP-quality human doses of CVT-301 for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and is now producing cGMP-quality CVT-301 powder for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. As we are already at commercial scale, we believe that this will support rapid commercialization should we receive marketing approval from the FDA. &#160; However, if we obtain approval from the FDA, we anticipate the need to expand our manufacturing operations at the Chelsea facility after product launch to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. The ARCUS dry powder aerosol particles are generated by applying our proprietary and multi-step spray drying process to active pharmaceutical ingredient. The application of spray drying in the pharmaceutical industry is highly specialized, and the process of manufacturing ARCUS particles requires significant expertise in dry powder manufacture and handling and capsule filling. 

&#160; 

We have developed mature quality systems to support commercial production. As described above, we have manufactured drug product at research and development scale and we believe that we have the expertise to transfer to large, commercial scale while maintaining all relevant drug product attributes. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to ensure reliable production that meets the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

All CVT-301 dry powder inventory has been manufactured in-house using our cGMP process. Current data supports CVT-301 as a room temperature stable product. We have finalized drug formulation and fill weight and have also implemented final design changes for the inhaler, for which commercial molds have been produced. All raw materials used for CVT-301 manufacture are standard in pharmaceutical production. Our manufacturing team is led by individuals who are highly experienced with manufacturing of ARCUS products and other commercial products. Many of the individuals who lead our manufacturing previously manufactured ARCUS products at this facility for Alkermes. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary inhalers are manufactured by contract manufacturers using standard manufacturing processes. We own the molds and design history files for the inhalers. The inhalers are shipped fully-assembled to us. Final design changes for the inhaler for our Phase 3 clinical trials and anticipated commercial launch have been implemented, and the molds have been produced. 

&#160; 

Plumiaz 

&#160;

We rely on third parties for the manufacturing and packaging of this product, the nasal delivery device, and the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. For commercial product, if we receive FDA approval, we have identified a potential manufacturer and potential suppliers, but we have not yet entered into any manufacturing or supply agreements with these companies and we cannot be certain that we can reach agreement with these companies on reasonable terms, if at all. 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa 

&#160;

We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of cimaglermin alfa in heart failure patients. This was a dose-escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose, with follow-up assessments at one, three, and six months. In October 2013, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in a second clinical trial of cimaglermin . This Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure is assessing tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin , which were tested in the first trial, and also includes assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. We voluntarily paused enrollment in this trial in December 2013 pending review of additional non-clinical data with the FDA. In April 2014, we announced that we had completed this review and recruitment was thereafter resumed. In June 2015 we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) meeting Hy&#8217;s Law criteria (elevated ALT, AST and bilirubin), based on blood test results. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information, and the trial remains subject to this clinical hold. The abnormal blood tests resolved within several days, as was the case with the one Hy&#8217;s Law case reported in the previous Phase 1 study noted above. The 22 patients who were dosed in the trial will complete the pre-planned one year of follow up. Outside of the hepatoxicity case, the safety profile from this trial was consistent with our first Phase 1 trial, but efficacy data was inconclusive which we believe was in part due to the very small number of patients in the trial. We have ongoing analyses and non-clinical studies to investigate the biological basis for liver effects, and we will need to meet with the FDA to review these and other data from the cimaglermin studies and to request that the program be removed from clinical hold. 

&#160; 

We contracted with CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc. in 2008 to produce and purify cimaglermin bulk material under cGMPs. Acorda and CMC Biologics have jointly developed analytical and characterization assays to support the manufacture of cimaglermin . The details of the manufacturing and purification processes and data from the analytical assays were provided to FDA in an IND application in March 2010. This drug substance was generated to support Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, safety and toxicology and to support drug product manufacturing. 

&#160;

The final drug product for cimaglermin for clinical studies was produced at Althea Technologies, now Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., under a Product Development and Clinical Supply Agreement signed in 2009, using material produced by CMC Biologics described above. The filling process and testing of the filled product was submitted to FDA as part of an IND application that was originally filed in March 2010. 

&#160;

rHIgM22 

&#160;

We have a remyelinating antibodies program that we acquired under license from the Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic. Studies have demonstrated the ability of this family of antibodies to stimulate repair of the myelin sheath in three different animal models of MS. Some antibodies within this portfolio also stimulate the growth of neurons and may have applications beyond demyelinating disorders. First identified in mice, similar remyelinating antibodies were subsequently identified in human blood 

&#160;

&#160; 

samples by Mayo Clinic. Our lead recombinant human remyelinating antibody, designated rHIgM22, has been produced under cGMPs, tested for safety in non-clinical studies and advanced to human trials in patients with MS. 

&#160; 

Other Products in Development 

&#160;

We have established the internal capability to manufacture research quantities of antibody and protein product candidates. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have patent portfolios relating to: Ampyra/aminopyridines; CVT-301, CVT-427 and the ARCUS technology; cimaglermin alfa /neuregulins; remyelinating antibodies/antibodies relating to nervous system disorders; chondroitinase; Plumiaz/diazepam nasal spray; and Qutenza and NP-1998/topical capsaicin formulations. These portfolios are comprised of both our own and in-licensed patents and patent applications. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights, confidential and trade secret information as well as a portfolio of trademarks. 

&#160;

Ampyra/aminopyridines 

&#160;

We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

The first is U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Based on the final patent term adjustment calculation of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, this patent will extend into 2027. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The second is U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938, the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease, such as MS, and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation, such as AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg for improving walking in people with MS. In April 2013, the patent received a five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With a five year patent term extension, this patent will expire in 2018. We have an exclusive license to this patent from Alkermes (originally with Elan, but transferred to Alkermes as part of its acquisition of Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The third is U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437, which includes claims relating to methods to improve walking, increase walking speed, and treat walking disability in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2026. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The fourth is U.S. Patent No. 8,440,703, which includes claims directed to methods of improving lower extremity function and walking and increasing walking speed in patients with MS by administering less than 15 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2025. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The fifth is U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685 with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Absent patent term adjustment, the patent is set to expire in 2025. 

Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from several generic drug manufacturers, and also inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the USPTO. An adverse outcome in these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange-Book listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 3 of this report. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. On February 24, 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021. 

&#160;

We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

We have pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign patent applications covering various methods of using aminopyridines, such as 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine), including applications which if issued as patents could remain in force at least through 2030 and 2032, respectively. 

&#160;

CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology 

&#160;

The intellectual property portfolio that we acquired with Civitas has over 100 issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to CVT-301 and the ARCUS technology. This includes over 15 issued U.S. patents relating to CVT-301 directed to compositions of the drug product, the inhaler, methods of delivery of L-dopa, and manufacturing processes. The latest of the issued patents expires in 2032. The CVT-427 program, which also utilizes the ARCUS technology, has a pending application directed to formulations, which, if granted would expire in 2036 absent any patent term adjustment. 

&#160;

Plumiaz/Diazepam Nasal Spray 

&#160;

Our wholly-owned subsidiary Neuronex, Inc. has a license from SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or SK, for two patent families comprising a granted U.S. patent and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to diazepam intranasal formulations and uses, including the clinical formulations for Plumiaz (our trade name for Diazepam Nasal Spray). The granted U.S. patent is set to expire in 2029. If granted, the pending patent applications would expire in 2029-2032. One patent family is owned by SK and one patent family is jointly owned by Neuronex and SK. 

&#160;

Cimaglermin alfa /Neuregulins 

&#160;

We are the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals, plc), of its worldwide portfolio of patents, patent applications and IP rights related to products of neuregulin genes, including cimaglermin alfa . Collectively, these patents claim the use of particular neuregulins to treat various pathophysiological conditions, particularly uses to stimulate myelinating cells in order to treat conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that involve demyelination. These patents also claim a number of additional potential uses of neuregulins, including stimulation of growth in cardiac and mammalian muscle cells, as well as treating cardiac failure, ischemic brain events, peripheral neuropathy and nerve injury. 

&#160;

Our neuregulin portfolio includes a granted U.S. patent directed to using specified neuregulin sequences to treat congestive heart failure. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Remyelinating Antibodies/Antibodies Related to Nervous System Disorders 

&#160;

Acorda is the exclusive licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to a series of remyelinating antibodies and their use discovered by scientists at the Mayo Clinic. This portfolio also includes pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to additional antibodies and their use. With regard to remyelinating antibodies, the portfolio includes U.S. issued patents directed to antibody compositions that can induce remyelination, as well as several issued related foreign counterparts. 

&#160; 

Chondroitinase 

&#160;

Our chondroitinase portfolio includes granted U.S. patents and granted foreign patent counterparts, as well as pending patent applications. The granted U.S. patents are directed to methods of using certain chondroitinase enzymes, including chondroitinase ABC-I, to reduce inflammation in patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, spinal cord injury (SCI) or MS and certain chondroitinase ABC-I mutant enzymes and related methods of use. The pending U.S. patent applications and their foreign counterparts are directed to chondroitinase enzymes, methods of use and formulations thereof. In particular, we have pending U.S. applications and foreign equivalents relating to chondroitinase enzymes, including fusion proteins of chondroitinase enzymes, chimeric proteins including chondroitinase enzymes, deletion mutants of chondroitinase enzymes and certain methods of use of the same. 

&#160;

In addition, we have a license from King's College and University of Cambridge to a pending U.S. application and its foreign counterparts directed to treatment of CNS damage. 

&#160;

Zanaflex 

&#160;

As part of our purchase from Elan of the Zanaflex assets, we acquired one issued U.S. patent and two pending U.S. patent applications. Our issued patent is generally directed to certain methods of reducing somnolence and reducing peak plasma concentrations in patients receiving tizanidine therapy. This issued patent expires in 2021. Our two pending U.S. patent applications are directed to multiparticulate formulations of tizanidine and certain other methods of using tizanidine. We also purchased the Zanaflex trademarks in the U.S. from Elan. 

&#160;

In addition, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Elan as part of the acquisition. This agreement is now with Alkermes due to Alkermes&#8217;s 2011 acquisition of Elan&#8217;s Drug Technologies business. Under this agreement, Zanaflex Capsules are manufactured for us by Alkermes using Alkermes's proprietary SODAS &#174; technology and proprietary information. This proprietary technology is owned by Alkermes and, in the event Alkermes ceases to manufacture Zanaflex Capsules, Alkermes has agreed to grant us a royalty-free, fully paid-up license of its manufacturing know-how and other information and rights related to the production of Zanaflex Capsules, including a license to use its SODAS &#174; technology for specified purposes. We have the right to sublicense this know-how to a third-party manufacturer, so long as this third party is not a technological competitor of Alkermes. 

&#160;

In August 2007, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice from Apotex Inc., advising that it had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Zanaflex Capsules. In response to the filing of the ANDA, in October 2007, we filed a lawsuit against Apotex in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey asserting infringement of our U.S. Patent No. 6,455,557. In September 2011, the Court ruled against us and, following our appeal, in June 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the decision. We did not seek any further appeals of the decision. 

&#160;

Qutenza and NP-1998/Topical Capsaicin Formulations 

We have commercialization and development rights for Qutenza and NP-1998 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. In the U.S., we have one Orange Book-listed patent for Qutenza, which is 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Patent No. 6,239,180. This patent is set to expire in 2016, absent any Hatch-Waxman extension for regulatory delays. Qutenza has Orphan Drug designation which gives it marketing exclusivity in the U.S. until 2016. 

There are granted U.S. patents which include claims directed to NP-1998 providing coverage until April 2027. There is also a pending U.S. patent application and pending foreign patent applications which, if granted, would expire in 2024. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160;

In addition to patents, our intellectual property portfolio includes registered trademarks, along with pending trademark applications. We own several registered trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. These registered trademarks include, in the U.S., the marks &#8220;Acorda Therapeutics,&#8221; our stylized Acorda Therapeutics logo, &#8220;Ampyra,&#8221; &#8220;Zanaflex,&#8221; &#8220;Zanaflex Capsules,&#8221; &#8220;Qutenza&#8221; and &#8220;ARCUS.&#8221; &#160; We also have trademark registrations for &#8220;Fampyra&#8221; and &#8220;Kampyra&#8221; and pending trademark applications therefore, in numerous foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our trademark portfolio includes several trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for potential product names and for disease awareness activities. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for developing and marketing pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. We are aware of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are engaged in development and/or marketing of therapeutics for a broad range of central nervous system conditions, including multiple sclerosis, or MS, stroke, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, or PD, epilepsy, heart failure, and spinal cord injury. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, human and other resources than we do. Furthermore, many of these companies have significantly more experience than we do in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, regulatory approval procedures and sales and marketing. 

&#160;

Ampyra/MS 

&#160;

Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex from Biogen, Betaseron from Schering AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Tysabri from Biogen and Elan, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Plegridy from Biogen, and Tecfidera from Biogen. 

&#160;

To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product that is approved as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. &#160; Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. &#160; BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. or BioMarin, acquired the rights formerly owned by EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd. to amifampridine phosphate, a 3,4-diaminopyridine compound, which in January 2010 received marketing authorization in the EU for use in Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or LEMS. In 2012, BioMarin outlicensed the North American rights to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. In the EU, and the U.S., if this product is successfully developed and approved, physicians might prescribe it instead of Ampyra, even if it were not approved for MS. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS, and we expect that some people will continue to do this. 

&#160;

Several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete with Ampyra or our preclinical candidates in the future. 

&#160;

We believe that Ampyra is complementary to both the relapse management and disease course management therapies that are commercially available. Nonetheless, Ampyra may compete for market acceptance with these current treatments because they have been accepted and regularly prescribed to people with MS by physicians, or because physicians may think that these products also improve walking or other neurological functions. 

&#160;

Ampyra could become subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from several generic drug manufacturers, and also inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. An adverse outcome in these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange-Book listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. We will need to devote significant resources to these legal proceedings, and if we are not successful our business could be materially harmed. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of these legal proceedings. 

&#160;

Zanaflex/Spasticity 

&#160;

Tizanidine hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets, is one of the two leading FDA-approved treatments for spasticity, a symptom suffered by, among others, both MS and SCI patients. Zanaflex tablets were approved by the FDA in 1996 and lost compound patent protection in 2002. A number of generic manufacturers of tizanidine hydrochloride are distributing their own tablet formulations. 

&#160;

In 2012 Apotex Inc. launched generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules, in 2012 we also launched an authorized generic version of Zanaflex Capsules under our agreement with an Allergan plc subsidiary (originally Watson Pharma, Inc., now part of the Actavis business owned by Allergan) and in 2013 Mylan Laboratories Limited launched generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. Other generic companies may also seek approval for their own generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. In addition, several companies have reported that they are working on potential new delivery formulations of tizanidine hydrochloride. Our net revenue from Zanaflex Capsules has declined significantly due to competition from existing generic versions, and we expect it will continue to decline in 2016 and beyond due to competition from existing and potentially other generic versions. 

&#160;

Baclofen, which is also available generically, is the other leading drug for the treatment of spasticity. The mechanism of action and associated effects of baclofen are different from those of tizanidine hydrochloride. Due to the different pharmacokinetic profile of Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are not AB-rated with Zanaflex Capsules but Apotex&#8217;s generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules are. 

&#160;

CVT-301/Parkinson&#8217;s disease 

&#160;

We believe that the main competitors for CVT-301 are therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods and other therapies for the on-demand treatment of OFF periods. These therapies include both pharmacotherapies and invasive therapies for advanced patients such as deep brain stimulation that may be used in less advanced Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients. Pharmacotherapies that can maintain consistent plasma 

&#160;

&#160; 

concentration of L-dopa over extended durations could reduce the occurrence of motor fluctuations and thus reduce the need for on-demand treatments for OFF periods such as CVT-301. Approaches to achieve consistent L-dopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of LD/CD, a combination of L-dopa and an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase (an enzyme found throughout the body) referred to as carbidopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of L-dopa. Impax Laboratories has received FDA approval for RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral LD/CD, and extended release formulations of oral and patch LD/CD are being developed by others including Impax Depomed Inc. and NeuroDerm Ltd. Also, Abbvie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing L-dopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU. Additionally, new formulations of dopamine agonist therapies (such as pramipexole and rotigotine) may be developed that can further prolong the effect of LD/CD regimens and reduce the frequency of motor fluctuations. 

&#160; 

If approved for the treatment of OFF periods, CVT-301 would compete against on-demand therapies that aim to specifically address OFF periods. At this time, Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is the only therapy approved for the treatment of OFF periods. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993. Also, Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine. This program is in Phase 3 clinical development and could potentially be commercially launched ahead of CVT-301. 

&#160;

One or more of our competitors may utilize their expertise in pulmonary delivery of drugs to develop and obtain approval for pulmonary delivery products that may compete with CVT-301 and any other of our other ARCUS technology product candidates. These competitors may include smaller companies such as Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MannKind Corporation, Pulmatrix, Inc. and Vectura Group plc and larger companies such as Allergan, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Novartis AG. If approved, our product candidates may face competition in the target commercial areas. 

&#160;

Plumiaz/Seizure Clusters or Acute Repetitive Seizures 

&#160;

Plumiaz (Diazepam Nasal Spray) is a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam that we are developing as a treatment for the management of selected, refractory patients with epilepsy, on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, or ARS . Currently, the only approved outpatient treatment for people who experience this type of seizure activity is diazepam rectal gel, a rectally administered gel formulation of diazepam. Diazepam is also available in other formulations, such as intramuscular and intravenous formulations for use in certain indications. Our current understanding is that many patients would prefer a therapeutic product delivered intranasally rather than delivery options of rectal or intramuscular administration, but we cannot be certain that physicians would prescribe Plumiaz in preference over other available formulations of diazepam or other products. Also, if we obtain FDA approval for and launch Plumiaz for the treatment of patients who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity, it may be more expensive than some or all of the generic or branded versions of diazepam otherwise available. Furthermore, we are aware that Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. (a Pfizer subsidiary) is developing an intramuscular auto-injector for diazepam, Upsher-Smith is developing a nasal delivery form of midazolam, Neurelis, Inc. is developing a nasal delivery form of diazepam, and Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing an inhaled version of alprazolam for use by patients who experience ARS, each of which could have a labeled indication similar to Plumiaz . Plumiaz could be subject to substantial competition from these potential products, depending on whether and when they receive FDA approval, their cost, their labeled indications, patient acceptance, and other factors. Additionally, in May 2013, Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. received orphan drug designation for a diazepam (autoinjector) used in management of selected, refractory patients with epilepsy on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity. The product is still in clinical development and has not been approved yet. In December 2015, Neurelis, Inc. received orphan drug designation for NRL-1 (intranasal diazepam) for the treatment of acute repetitive seizures. If either of these products receives FDA approval before Plumiaz, Plumiaz will be excluded from the market for seven (7) years unless we are able to 

&#160;

&#160; 

prove to the FDA that the Plumiaz nasal spray is clinically superior to, or offers a major contribution to, patient care relative to these alternative diazepam products for the same therapeutic indication. 

&#160; 

In addition to these examples, there are other companies with early stage development programs for the treatment of epilepsy, including breakthrough seizures, seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, that could compete with Plumiaz in the future. 

&#160;

Qutenza/Post-Herpetic Neuralgia 

&#160;

Qutenza faces significant competition from various other oral and topical products that are indicated to treat post-herpetic neuralgia and/or other forms of neuropathic pain, as well as other prescription and over the counter pain medications not specifically indicated for neuropathic pain that patients may use to address their symptoms. Many of the prescription pain medications that may compete with Qutenza are available in generic forms. If we successfully develop and commercialize NP-1998, this product would similarly face significant competition from these other products. 

&#160;

Also, unlike our other products, Qutenza may be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting. For this reason, it is treated as a &#8220;buy-and-bill&#8221; product by most payers, including most Medicare programs, Medicaid programs, and private payers. Buy-and-bill products must be purchased by health care providers before they can be administered to patients. Health care providers subsequently must seek reimbursement for the product from the applicable third party payer such as Medicaid or a health insurance company. Health care providers may be reluctant to administer Qutenza because they would have to fund the purchase of the product and then seek reimbursement (which may differ somewhat from their purchase price), or because they do not want the additional administrative burden required for the product. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

FDA Regulation of Drugs and Drug Product Approval 

&#160;

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical testing, clinical development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, sale, promotion, import and export of our products and product candidates. 

&#160;

In the U.S., Ampyra, Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets, Qutenza, and our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs. Some of our product candidates are potentially regulated both as drugs, drug/medical device combinations and as biological products. Drugs and biologics primarily are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA's and other health authorities' delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies or agencies of the states and localities in which our products are tested, manufactured, sold or distributed. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The process required by the FDA under these laws before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic, for each intended use; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

FDA review of whether each facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, containing preclinical and clinical data, proposed labeling, information to demonstrate that the product will be manufactured to appropriate standards, and other required information. 

&#160;

The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all. 

&#160;

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its safety and potential efficacy. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND sponsor may initiate clinical trials 30 days after filing the IND application, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, charged with protecting the welfare of human subjects involved in research at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical trial before it commences at that center. The IRB(s) must continue to monitor the trial until its completion. Many studies also employ a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, with experts who are otherwise independent of the conduct of the study and are given access to the unblinded study data periodically during the study to determine whether the study should be halted. For example, a DSMB might halt a study if an unacceptable safety issue emerges, or if the data showing the effectiveness of the study drug would make it unethical to continue giving patients placebo. Study subjects must provide informed consent before their participation in the research study. 

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially administered into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Phase 3. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to confirm the clinical efficacy from Phase 2 and to further test for safety in an expanded population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160; 

In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as MS, the initial human testing is often conducted in affected patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target condition, these clinical trials may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these clinical trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials. 

&#160;

Before proceeding with a Phase 3 trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial, but the agreement does not guarantee FDA approval even if the SPA is followed. For example a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug could be identified after the testing has begun. In addition, even if an SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses, or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations. 

&#160;

Federal and state law requires the submission of registry and results information for most clinical trials to a publicly available database at www.clinicaltrials.gov. These requirements generally do not apply to Phase 1 clinical trials. 

&#160;

U.S. law requires that trials conducted to support approval for product marketing be "adequate and well controlled." This entails a number of requirements, including that there is a clear statement of objects and methods in the protocol, the study design permits a valid comparison with a control (e.g., a placebo, another drug already approved for the studied condition, or a non-concurrent control such as historical data), and that the statistical methods used to analyze the data are adequate to assess the effects of the drug. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. 

&#160;

We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRBs or the DSMB may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold or terminate them at any point in this process if, among other reasons, they conclude that study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

&#160;

In the U.S., the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to marketing and commercial distribution of the product candidate. If the product candidate is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. If the product candidate, such as an antibody, is regulated as a biologic, a BLA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA or BLA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness (for a drug) and safety, purity and potency (for a biologic) of the compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling. 

&#160;

Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or BLA and must be registered with the FDA. The application will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug or biological product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. If the manufacturing facilities and processes fail to pass the FDA inspection, we will not receive approval to market these products, or approval may be delayed until the manufacturing issues are resolved. The FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites and will not approve the product unless the clinical studies have been conducted in compliance with GCP. 

&#160;

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing a BLA or NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees could be significant. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Once an NDA or BLA is submitted for FDA approval, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing if deemed complete, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs and BLAs: six months for priority applications and 10 months for regular applications, with two additional months added to each period for new molecular entities. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if favorable, often is not an actual approval but an &#8220;action letter&#8221; or &#8220;complete response letter&#8221; that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. This additional work could include substantial additional clinical trials. The FDA's review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. 

&#160;

The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it will limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, may require that contraindications or warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional post-approval studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or may otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Under a REMS, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on distribution and use of a marketed product, may require the distribution of medication guides to patients and/or healthcare professionals or patient communication plans, and may impose a timetable for submission of assessments of the effectiveness of a REMS. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 

&#160;

Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years or more and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time or permanently and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, labeling changes or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals would harm our business. Marketing our product candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action. 

&#160;

Post-Approval Regulation 

&#160;

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements relating to record-keeping, labeling, packaging, reporting of adverse experiences and other reporting, advertising and promotion, distribution, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and import/export, as well as any other requirements imposed by the applicants NDA or BLA. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that we not promote our products for unapproved uses and that our promotion be fairly balanced and adequately substantiated. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug, require post-approval studies or clinical trials, or impose a REMS post-approval if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes impacts the drug&#8217;s safety profile. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Foreign drug manufacturers must comply with similar local requirements and may be subject to inspections by the FDA or local regulatory agencies. We cannot be 

&#160;

&#160; 

certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and other regulatory requirements. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. 

&#160; 

In addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or FDA Form 483. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns. Failure to address the FDA&#8217;s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions. 

&#160;

We and our product candidates are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where they are or will be marketed, or where we may have operations. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Federal law and some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including requirements for the development of systems capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Any applicable federal, state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities. 

&#160;

The FDA's policies may change and additional U.S. or foreign government regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to market products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could harm our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 

&#160;

Orphan Drugs 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplemental NDA or BLA for the orphan use. We received an orphan drug designation for Ampyra for the treatment of both MS and incomplete SCI. The number of people affected by MS now exceeds 200,000. However, this does not affect Ampyra&#8217;s orphan drug designation in the United States, as it was granted prior to the increase in prevalence above 200,000. 

&#160;

Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, and reduced filing fees for marketing applications. If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another sponsor if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior or demonstrates a major contribution to patient care, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public's need. If the FDA approves another 

&#160;

&#160; 

sponsor&#8217;s application for a drug that is the same as a drug with orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its approved use, including for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses. 

&#160; 

Some other jurisdictions have orphan drug rules and offer similar incentives. In the EU, for example, a designated orphan drug benefits from free scientific advice and reduced application fees. Moreover, an approved orphan drug benefits from a 10-year exclusivity period, during which regulators can neither accept nor approve applications for similar medicinal products for the same indication, unless there are insufficient supplies of the approved orphan drug or the similar product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the approved orphan drug. Under the EU system, however, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, will reassess orphan status in parallel with the European Medicines Agency&#8217;s assessment of the marketing authorization application and the COMP can recommend that orphan status is removed if the product no longer meets the relevant criteria. 

&#160;

Generic Drugs, AB Ratings and Pharmacy Substitution 

&#160;

Generic drugs are approved through an abbreviated regulatory process, which differs in important ways from the process followed for innovative products. For generic versions of drugs subject to an NDA, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, is filed with the FDA. The ANDA must seek approval of a product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so-called "reference listed drug" approved pursuant to a full NDA. Only limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special suitability petition process. ANDA applicants are not required to submit clinical data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Instead, FDA relies on its findings of safety and effectiveness of the reference listed drug to approve the ANDA. As a result, the law requires the ANDA applicant submit only limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at a rate and extent consistent with that of the reference listed drug. This is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, and must contain certifications to patents listed with the FDA for the reference listed drug. 

&#160;

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, drugs that are new chemicals entities, or NCEs, are eligible for a five-year data exclusivity period. During this period, FDA may not accept for review an ANDA submitted by another company that relies on any of the data submitted by the innovator company. This exclusivity period also applies to &#8220;505(b)(2)&#8221; applications, which are a hybrid application that relies in-part on pioneer data and in-part on new clinical data submitted to account for differences between the 505(b)(2) product and the reference listed drug. However, an ANDA (or 505(b)(2) application) may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The statute also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA (or NDA supplement) that is not an NCE if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed essential to approval. During this period, FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data that was submitted by the innovator company. Neither exclusivity period blocks the approval of full applications (i.e., full NDAs) submitted to FDA that do not rely on the pioneer&#8217;s data. 

&#160;

Special procedures apply when an ANDA contains certifications stating that a listed patent is invalid or not infringed. If the owner of the patent or the NDA for the reference listed drug brings a patent infringement suit within a specified time after receiving notice of the patent certification, an automatic stay bars FDA approval of the ANDA for 30 months, which period may be extended under certain circumstances. The length of the automatic stay depends on whether the FDA classifies the reference listed drug as an NCE, as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

If the FDA does not classify the reference listed drug as an NCE, then the automatic stay is for 30 months from the date that the manufacturer of the reference listed drug receives the patent certification described above. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

If the reference listed drug is classified by the FDA as an NCE, then the timing of the automatic stay depends on when the ANDA is filed, as well as when the manufacturer of the reference listed drug receives the patent certification described above. No company can file an ANDA on a reference listed drug that FDA has designated as an NCE until five years after the reference listed drug&#8217;s FDA approval, except that an ANDA may be submitted four years after the reference listed drug&#8217;s FDA approval if the ANDA contains the patent certification described above. If the ANDA is filed five or more years after FDA approval of the NCE, then the 30 month stay is applicable. However, if an ANDA is filed in between the fourth and fifth years after FDA approval of the NCE, the automatic 30 month stay is extended by a number of months equal to the number of months remaining in the fifth year after approval of the reference listed drug, providing a total of up to a 42 month stay. 

&#160;

If the stay is either lifted or expires and the ANDA applicant otherwise meets the FDA&#8217;s requirements for the approval of ANDAs, the generic manufacturer may decide to begin selling its product even if patent litigation is pending. However, if the generic manufacturer launches before patent litigation is resolved, the launch is at the risk of the generic manufacturer being later held liable for patent infringement damages. 

&#160; 

Many states require or permit pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions unless the physician has prohibited substitution. Managed care organizations often urge physicians to prescribe drugs with generic equivalents, and to authorize substitution, as a means of controlling costs of prescriptions. They also may require lower copayments as an incentive to patients to ask for and accept generics. 

&#160;

While the question of substitutability is one of state law, most states look to the FDA to determine whether a generic is substitutable. The FDA lists therapeutic equivalence ratings in a publication often referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; In general, a generic drug that is listed in the Orange Book as therapeutically equivalent to the branded product will be substitutable under state law and, conversely, a generic drug that is not so listed will not be substitutable. Solid oral dosage form drug products that are considered therapeutically equivalent are generally rated &#8220;AB&#8221; in the Orange Book. 

&#160;

To be considered therapeutically equivalent, a generic drug must first be a pharmaceutical equivalent of the branded drug. This means that the generic has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength or concentration and route of administration as the brand-name drug. Tablets and capsules are currently considered different dosage forms that are pharmaceutical alternatives and therefore are not substitutable pharmaceutical equivalents. In addition to being pharmaceutical equivalents, therapeutic equivalents must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts. Bioequivalence for this purpose is defined in the same manner as for ANDA approvals, and usually requires a showing of comparable rate and extent of absorption in a small human study. 

&#160;

Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices in the United States 

&#160;

The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of medical devices. The level of regulation applied by the FDA generally depends on the class into which the medical device falls: Class I, II, or III. Class I medical devices present the lowest risk, and Class III medical devices present the highest risk. In general, the higher class of device, the greater the degree of regulatory control. All devices, for example, are subject to &#8220;General Controls,&#8221; which include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establishment registration by manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers, and re-labelers; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Device listing with FDA; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Good manufacturing practices; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Labeling regulations; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Reporting of adverse events. 

&#160;

Class II medical devices are subject to General Controls, but also Special Controls, including special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, additional post market surveillance, and specific FDA guidance. Most Class III medical devices are assessed individually through an extensive Premarket Review application, or PMA. As a result, although they are subject to General Controls, they generally are not subject to Special Controls. Instead, most Class III devices have additional requirements and conditions of use imposed on them through the individualized PMA review and approval process. 

&#160;

Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA premarket review or approval. With some exceptions, Class II devices may be marketed only if the FDA &#8220;clears&#8221; the medical device through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to certain devices already on the market. Again with some exceptions, Class III devices are approved through a PMA, which generally requires an applicant to submit data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. Clinical data are sometimes required for a 510(k) application as well. Manufacturers conducting clinical trials with medical devices are subject to similar requirements as those conducting clinical trials with drugs or biologics. For example, a manufacturer must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to test a significant risk device in humans, must comply with GCPs, and must obtain IRB approval. 

&#160;

The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. For example, medical devices are subject to detailed manufacturing standards under the FDA&#8217;s quality systems regulations, or QSRs, and specific rules regarding labeling and promotion. Medical device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their products with the FDA. 

&#160;

States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors, including registration and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable federal and state medical device requirements could result in, among other things, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or clearance, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or other civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160;

Biosimilars 

&#160;

The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the FDA to approve &#8220;biosimilars&#8221; (follow-on versions of products approved pursuant to a BLA) via a separate, abbreviated pathway. Under this abbreviated pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is &#8220;highly similar&#8221; to the &#8220;reference product,&#8221; and that there are no &#8220;clinically meaningful differences&#8221; between the biosimilar and the reference product. Unlike ANDAs, biosimilars are not, in general, automatically substitutable for the reference product at the pharmacy. Instead, the FDA must make a separate finding of &#8220;interchangeability,&#8221; and the various state laws regarding pharmacy substitution of &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; and &#8220;non-interchangeable&#8221; biosimilars is as yet unsettled. 

&#160;

The Affordable Care Act also established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity against biosimilars for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the BLA-holders&#8217;s regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the reference product&#8217;s data in its approved BLA. In contrast to the provisions for NDAs, the biologics data exclusivity provisions do not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products, or otherwise create an &#8220;automatic stay&#8221; of FDA approval of a biosimilar. If our product candidates are approved as biologics, they may face significant competition from biosimilars in the future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160; 

Outside the U.S., our ability or the ability of our collaborator Biogen to market a product candidate is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Foreign marketing authorizations can be applied for at a national level, although within the European Union, or EU, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in the entire European Economic Area, or EEA (through the &#8220;centralized procedure,&#8221; which is mandatory for certain products, including biotechnology and advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicines and new active substances for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases), or in more than one individual EU member state (through the &#8220;mutual recognition procedure&#8221; or &#8220;decentralized procedure&#8221;). The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above. 

&#160;

Other Regulations 

&#160;

In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products, as well as medical devices, are potentially subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and state and local governments. For example, controlled substances that are scheduled by the DEA are subject to additional regulatory requirements including, among other things, special security and handling requirements, and potential restrictions on distribution, sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs, and other Acorda interactions with healthcare professionals, must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and may be affected by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and/or the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. For products to be made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, or DOD, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, under legislative changes made in 2009, discounted prices must also be offered for certain DOD purchases for its TRICARE retail pharmacy program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

&#160;

Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to restrict the use of certain physician prescribing data for sales and marketing purposes, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

&#160;

Under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal reporting and disclosure requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under these requirements will be placed on a public database. &#160; Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS annually. &#160; Similarly, 

&#160;

&#160; 

pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to annually report to FDA samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these sample disclosures will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any additional guidance as to how the data will be used. 

&#160;

Our research and development and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among other matters, those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances; the exposure of persons to hazardous substances; the release of pollutants into the air and bodies of water; and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Our research and development and manufacturing activities and the activities of our third-party manufacturers involve the use of hazardous substances, and the risk of injury, contamination or noncompliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements cannot be eliminated. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Although compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent legal or regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us. 

&#160;

Reimbursement and Pricing Controls 

&#160;

In many of the markets where we or Biogen, our collaborator for Ampyra, would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls, by law, and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. 

&#160;

In the U.S., there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Various states have adopted further mechanisms under Medicaid and other programs that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products. 

&#160;

Under the reimbursement methodology set forth in the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, physicians are reimbursed for drugs they administer to Medicare beneficiaries based on a product's "average sales price," or ASP. This ASP-based reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels. The MMA also established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The ACA requires drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the &#8220;donut hole.&#8221; 

&#160;

The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price are reported to the government and the formula for calculating required Medicaid rebates. The ACA increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the ACA increased the additional Medicaid rebate on &#8220;line extensions&#8221; (such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of AMP by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the entities eligible for discounted 340B pricing. 

&#160;

The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer&#8217;s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The ACA also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal 

&#160;

&#160; 

healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research for use in the healthcare industry, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that will affect existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. 

&#160;

We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the ACA. The ACA and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. 

&#160;

Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private healthcare payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. 

&#160;

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. For example, in the European Union, some governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through reference pricing approaches to pharmaceutical reimbursement for national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

&#160;
