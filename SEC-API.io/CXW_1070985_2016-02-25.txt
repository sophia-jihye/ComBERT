 ITEM 1. BUSI NESS. Overvi ew 

We are the nation&#146;s largest owner of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled 66 correctional and detention facilities and managed an additional 11 facilities owned by our government partners, with a total design capacity of approximately 88,500 beds in 20 states and the District of Columbia. 

We are a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, specializing in owning, operating, and managing prisons and other correctional facilities and providing residential, community re-entry, and prisoner transportation services for governmental agencies. In addition to providing fundamental residential services, our facilities offer a variety of rehabilitation and educational programs, including basic education, faith-based services, life skills and employment training, and substance abuse treatment. These services are intended to help reduce recidivism and to prepare offenders for their successful re-entry into society upon their release. We also provide or make available to offenders certain health care (including medical, dental, and mental health services), food services, and work and recreational programs. 

We are a Maryland corporation formed in 1983. Our principal executive offices are located at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee, 37215, and our telephone number at that location is (615) 263-3000. Our website address is www.cca.com. We make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report. 

We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2013. Since that date, we have provided correctional services and conducted other operations through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax and certain qualification requirements. Our use of TRSs enables us to comply with REIT qualification requirements while providing correctional services at facilities we own and at facilities owned by our government partners and to engage in certain other operations. A TRS is not subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs so it may retain income generated by its operations for reinvestment. 

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived from providing prison bed capacity and dividends we earn from our TRSs. However, our TRSs will be required to pay income taxes on their earnings at regular corporate income tax rates. 

As a REIT, we generally are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains). Our REIT taxable income will not typically include income earned by our TRSs except to the extent our TRSs pay dividends to the REIT. 

Our customers consist of federal, state, and local correctional and detention authorities. Federal correctional and detention authorities primarily consist of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, or the BOP, the United States Marshals Service, or the USMS, and ICE. Payments by federal correctional and detention authorities represented 51%, 44%, and 44% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

Our customer contracts typically have terms of three to five years and contain multiple renewal options. Most of our facility contracts also contain clauses that allow the government agency to terminate the contract at any time without cause, and our contracts are generally subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations of funds. 

We are compensated for providing prison bed capacity and correctional services at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels. Occupancy rates for a particular facility are typically low when first opened or immediately following an expansion. However, beyond the start-up period, which typically ranges from 90 to 180 days, the occupancy rate tends to stabilize. We also lease facilities to governmental agencies and third-party operators. The average compensated occupancy of our facilities, based on rated capacity, exclusive of facilities that have been presented as discontinued operations, was as follows for the years 2015, 2014, and 2013:

Operatin g Procedures 

Pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts, we are responsible for the overall operations of our facilities, including staff recruitment, general administration of the facilities, facility maintenance, security, and supervision of the offenders. We are required by our customer contracts to maintain certain levels of insurance coverage for general liability, workers&#146; compensation, vehicle liability, and property loss or damage. We are also required to indemnify our customers for claims and costs arising out of our operations and, in certain cases, to maintain performance bonds and other collateral requirements. Approximately 92% of the eligible facilities we operated at December 31, 2015, excluding our community corrections facilities, were accredited by the American Correctional Association Commission on Accreditation. The American Correctional Association, or ACA, is an independent organization comprised of corrections professionals that establishes accreditation standards for correctional and detention institutions. 

We are committed to equipping offenders in our care with the services, support, and resources necessary to return to the community as productive, contributing members of society. To that end, we provide a wide range of evidence-based re-entry programs and activities at our facilities. At most of the facilities we manage, offenders have the opportunity to enhance their basic education from literacy through the acquisition of the high school equivalency diploma endorsed by the respective state and, in some cases, postsecondary educational achievements. In a number of our facilities, and in conjunction with the Mexican government, we offer an adult education curriculum recognized by a number of nations to which these offenders may return. 

&#160;

In addition, we offer a broad spectrum of vocational/technical education opportunities to equip individuals with marketable job skills. Our trade programs are certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research, or NCCER. NCCER establishes the curriculum and certification for over 4,000 construction and trade organizations. Graduates of these programs enter the job market with certified skills that significantly enhance employability. For those with assessed substance use disorder needs, we offer evidence-based treatment programs such as the Residential Drug Addictions Treatment Program, or RDAP, with proven clinical outcomes. Our Re-Entry and Life Skills programs prepare individuals for life after incarceration by teaching offenders how to successfully conduct a job search, how to manage their budget and financial matters, parenting skills, and relationship and family skills. Equally significant, we offer cognitive behavioral programs aimed at changing anti-social attitudes and behaviors of offenders, with a focus on altering the level of criminal thinking of offenders. Our Victim Impact Programs, available at a number of our facilities, seek to educate offenders on the negative effects upon others resulting from their criminal conduct. At a number of our facilities, we provide faith-based programs to those seeking spiritual growth and character development. Our facilities offer opportunities for religious worship and study for a variety of faith groups and belief systems. Across the country, these programs incorporate the use of thousands of volunteers, along with our staff, who assist in providing guidance, direction, and post-incarceration services to offenders. We believe that together these efforts help us achieve reductions in recidivism. 

Through our community corrections facilities, we provide an array of services to defendants and offenders who are serving their full sentence, the last portion of their sentence, waiting to be sentenced, or awaiting trial while supervised in a community environment. We offer housing and programs, with a key focus on employment, job readiness, and life skills, in order to help offenders successfully re-enter the community and reduce the risk of recidivism. We also offer an alternative sentencing option to the courts which allows offenders who are gainfully employed to pay 100% of their cost of incarceration while serving their sentence in a community facility. 

In addition, in some of our community corrections facilities, we offer housing and program services to parolees who have completed their sentence, but lack a viable home plan. Through a focus on employment and skill development, we provide a means for these parolees to successfully reintegrate into their communities. 

Outside agency standards, such as those established by the ACA, provide us with the industry&#146;s most widely accepted operational guidelines. We have sought and received accreditation for 44 of the eligible facilities we operated as of December 31, 2015, excluding our community corrections facilities. 

Beyond the standards provided by the ACA, our facilities are operated in accordance with a variety of company and facility-specific policies and procedures, as well as various contractual requirements. These policies and procedures reflect the high standards generated by a number of sources, including the ACA, The Joint Commission, the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, federal, state, and local government codes and regulations, established correctional procedures, and company-wide policies and procedures that may exceed these guidelines. 

Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, regulations were published in June 2012 and became effective in August 2013. All confinement facilities covered under the PREA standards must be audited at least every three years to be considered compliant with the PREA standards, with one-third of each facility type operated by an agency, or private organization on behalf of an agency, audited each year. These include adult prisons and jails, juvenile facilities, 

&#160;

lockups (housing detainees overnight), and community confinement facilities, whether operated by the Department of Justice or unit of a state, local, corporate, or nonprofit authority. 

Our facilities operate under these established standards, policies, and procedures, and also are subject to audits by our Quality Assurance Division, or QAD, which works independent from Operations management under the auspices of, and reports directly to, our Office of General Counsel. We have devoted significant resources to meeting outside agency and accrediting organization standards and guidelines. 

The QAD employs a team of full-time auditors, who are subject matter experts from all major disciplines within institutional operations. Annually, without advance notice, QAD auditors conduct on site evaluations of each facility we operate using specialized operational audit tools, often containing more than 1,000 audited items across all major operational areas. In most instances, these audit tools are tailored to facility and partner specific requirements. Audit teams are also made available to work with facilities in specific areas of need, such as meeting requirements of new partner contracts or providing detailed training of new departmental managers. 

The QAD management team coordinates overall operational auditing and compliance efforts across all CCA facilities. In conjunction with subject matter experts and other stakeholders having risk management responsibilities, the QAD management team develops performance measurement tools used in facility audits. The QAD management team provides governance of the corporate plan of action process for issues identified through internal and external facility reviews. Our QAD also contracts with teams of ACA certified correctional auditors to evaluate compliance with ACA standards at accredited facilities. Similarly, the QAD coordinates the work of certified PREA auditors to help ensure that all facilities operate in compliance with these important regulations. 

We currently provide transportation services to governmental agencies through our wholly-owned TRS, TransCor America, LLC, or TransCor. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, TransCor generated total revenue of $4.1 million, $4.4 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, or approximately 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.2% of our total consolidated revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We believe TransCor provides a complementary service to our core business that enables us to respond quickly to our customers&#146; transportation needs. 

&#160;

2015 Accomplis hments 

In 2015, we completed several significant transactions and milestones that we believe position us well to execute our business strategies, including the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed construction of the 2,552-bed Trousdale Turner Correctional Center and successfully prepared the new facility for the intake of inmates in the first quarter of 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed construction of the 1,482-bed Otay Mesa Detention Center and successfully transitioned operations from the San Diego Correctional Facility to the new facility in the fourth quarter of 2015. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed the activation of the 2,400&#150;bed South Texas Family Residential Center for our contract to provide safe and humane residential housing, as well as educational opportunities, to women and children under the custody of ICE, who are awaiting their due process before immigration courts. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Amended and restated our $900.0 million revolving credit facility, or revolving credit facility, to, among other things, reduce by 0.25% the applicable margin of base rate and London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, loans, and extend the maturity from December 2017 to July 2020. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed the offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due 2022, thereby reducing our exposure to variable rate debt, increasing the availability under our revolving credit facility, and extending our weighted average debt maturities. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Obtained $100.0 million under an incremental term loan, or Term Loan, under the &#147;accordion&#148; feature of our revolving credit facility with a maturity of July 2020 and, after the first two fiscal quarters following the closing of the loan, carrying the same interest rates as our revolving credit facility. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed the acquisition of Avalon Correctional Services Inc., a privately held community corrections company that operates 11 community corrections facilities with approximately 3,000 beds in Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Completed the acquisition of four community corrections facilities in Pennsylvania with a capacity of approximately 600 beds that are leased to a third-party operator under triple net lease agreements. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Announced in December 2015, an award from the Arizona Department of Corrections to house up to an additional 1,000 medium-security inmates at our Red Rock Correctional Center in Arizona. We expect to begin receiving inmates from Arizona under the new contract beginning late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2016. &#160;

Busines s Development 

We believe we own approximately 59% of all privately owned prison beds in the United States, manage nearly 42% of all privately managed prison beds in the United States, and are currently the second largest private owner and provider of community corrections services in the nation. Under the direction of our partnership development department, we market our facilities and services to government agencies responsible for federal, state, and local correctional and detention facilities in the United States. Under the direction of our strategic development department, we pursue asset acquisitions and business combination transactions that we believe will provide favorable investment returns and increase value to our stockholders. 

As indicated by the following chart, business from our federal customers, including primarily the BOP, USMS, and ICE, continues to be a significant component of our business. The BOP, USMS, and ICE were the only federal partners that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during the last three years. 

&#160;

Certain of our contracts with federal partners contain clauses that guarantee the federal partner access to a minimum bed capacity in exchange for a fixed monthly payment. 

Despite our increase in federal revenue, inmate populations in federal facilities, particularly within the BOP system nationwide, have declined over the past two years. Inmate populations in the BOP system declined in 2015 and are expected to decline further in 2016 due, in part, to the retroactive application of changes to sentencing guidelines applicable to federal drug trafficking offenses. However, we do not expect a significant impact on us because BOP inmate populations within our facilities are primarily criminal aliens incarcerated for immigration violations rather than drug trafficking offenses. Further, the public sector BOP correctional system remains overcrowded at approximately 119.5% at December 31, 2015. Nonetheless, increases in capacity within the federal system could result in a decline in BOP populations within our facilities, and could negatively impact the future demand for prison capacity. 

Business from our state customers, which constituted 42%, 48%, and 49% of total revenue during the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, decreased 4.4% from $791.8 million during 2014 to $756.9 million during 2015. The State of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or CDCR, accounted for 11%, 14%, and 12% of total revenue for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, including revenue generated under an operating lease that commenced December 1, 2013, at our California City facility. The CDCR was our only state partner that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during these years. 

&#160;

Several of our state partners are projecting improvements in their budgets which has resulted in our ability to secure recent per diem increases at certain facilities. Further, several of our existing state partners, as well as state partners with which we do not currently do business, are experiencing growth in inmate populations and overcrowded conditions. Although we can provide no assurance that we will enter into any new contracts, we believe we are in a good position to not only provide them with needed bed capacity, but with the programming and re-entry services they are seeking. 

We believe the long-term growth opportunities of our business remain attractive as governments consider efficiency, savings, and offender programming opportunities we can provide. Further, we expect our partners to continue to face challenges in maintaining old facilities, and developing new facilities and additional capacity which could result in future demand for the solutions that we provide. 

We believe that we can further develop our business by, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining and expanding our existing customer relationships and filling existing beds within our facilities, while maintaining an adequate inventory of available beds that we believe provides us with flexibility and a competitive advantage when bidding for new management contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhancing the terms of our existing contracts and expanding the services we provide under those contracts; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuing additional opportunities to purchase and manage existing government-owned facilities; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuing additional opportunities to lease our facilities to government and other third-party operators in need of correctional capacity; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursuing other asset acquisitions and business combinations through transactions with non-government third parties; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintaining and expanding our focus on community corrections and re-entry programming that align with the needs of our government partners; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Establishing relationships with new customers who have either previously not outsourced their correctional facility management needs or have utilized other private enterprises. We generally receive inquiries from or on behalf of government agencies that are considering outsourcing the ownership and/or management of certain facilities or that have already decided to contract with a private enterprise. When we receive such an inquiry, we determine whether there is an existing need for our correctional facilities and/or services and whether the legal and political climate in which the inquiring party operates is conducive to serious consideration of outsourcing. Based on these findings, an initial cost analysis is conducted to further determine project feasibility. 

&#160;

Frequently, government agencies responsible for correctional and detention facilities and services procure space and services through solicitations or competitive procurements. As part of our process of responding to such requests, members of our management team meet with the appropriate personnel from the agency making the request to best determine the agency&#146;s needs. If the project fits within our strategy, we submit a written response. A typical solicitation or competitive procurement requires bidders to provide detailed information, including, but not limited to, the space and services to be provided by the bidder, its experience and qualifications, and the price at which the bidder is willing to provide the facility and services (which services may include the purchase, renovation, improvement or expansion of an existing facility or the planning, design and construction of a new facility). The requesting agency selects a firm believed to be able to provide the requested bed capacity, if needed, and most qualified to provide the requested services and then negotiates the price and terms of the contract with that firm. 

Facility Portfolio 

General 

Our facilities can generally be classified according to the level(s) of security at such facility. Minimum security facilities have open housing within an appropriately designed and patrolled institutional perimeter. Medium security facilities have either cells, rooms or dormitories, a secure perimeter, and some form of external patrol. Maximum security facilities have cells, a secure perimeter, and external patrol. Multi-security facilities have various areas encompassing minimum, medium or maximum security. 

Our facilities can also be classified according to their primary function. The primary functional categories are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Correctional Facilities . Correctional facilities house and provide contractually agreed upon programs and services to sentenced adult prisoners, typically prisoners on whom a sentence in excess of one year has been imposed. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Detention Facilities . Detention facilities house and provide contractually agreed upon programs and services to (i) prisoners being detained by ICE, (ii) prisoners who are awaiting trial who have been charged with violations of federal criminal law (and are therefore in the custody of the USMS) or state criminal law, and (iii) prisoners who have been convicted of crimes and on whom a sentence of one year or less has been imposed. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Community Corrections. Community corrections facilities offer housing and programs to offenders who are serving the last portion of their sentence or who have been assigned to the facility in lieu of a jail or prison sentence, with a key focus on employment, job readiness, and life skills. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Residential Facilities. Residential facilities provide space and residential services in an open and safe environment to adults with children who illegally crossed the U.S. border and are awaiting the outcome of immigration hearings or the return to their home countries. As contractually agreed upon, residential facilities offer services including, but not limited to, educational programs, medical care, recreational activities, counseling, and access to religious and legal services. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Leased Facilities . Leased facilities are facilities that we own but do not manage and that are leased to third-party operators. We currently lease two correctional facilities and four community corrections facilities to third-party operators. Facilities and Facility Management Contracts 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled 66 correctional and detention facilities in 18 states and the District of Columbia, six of which we leased to third-party operators. Additionally, we managed 11 correctional and detention facilities owned by government agencies. We also owned two corporate office buildings. Owned and managed facilities include facilities placed into service that we own or control via a lease and manage. Managed-only facilities include facilities we manage that are owned by a third party. The following table sets forth all of the facilities that, as of December 31, 2015, we (i) owned and managed, (ii) owned, but were leased to another operator, and (iii) managed but are owned by a government authority. The table includes certain information regarding each facility, including the term of the primary customer contract related to such facility, or, in the case of facilities we owned but leased to a third-party operator, the term of such lease.

(A) Design capacity measures the number of beds and, accordingly, the number of offenders each facility is designed to accommodate. Facilities housing detainees on a short term basis may exceed the original intended design capacity due to the lower level of services required by detainees in custody for a brief period. From time to time, we may evaluate the design capacity of our facilities based on customers using the facilities, and the ability to reconfigure space with minimal capital outlays. As a result, the design capacity of certain facilities may vary from the design capacity previously presented. We believe design capacity is an appropriate measure for evaluating prison operations, because the revenue generated by each facility is based on a per diem or monthly rate per inmate housed at the facility paid by the corresponding contracting governmental entity. (B) We manage numerous facilities that have more than a single function (e.g., housing both long-term sentenced adult prisoners and pre-trial detainees). The primary functional categories into which facility types are identified were determined by the relative size of inmate populations in a particular facility on December 31, 2015. If, for example, a 1,000-bed facility housed 900 adult inmates with sentences in excess of one year and 100 pre-trial detainees, the primary functional category to which it would be assigned would be that of correctional facilities and not detention facilities. It should be understood that the primary functional category to which multi-user facilities are assigned may change from time to time. (C) Remaining renewal options represents the number of renewal options, if applicable, and the term of each option renewal. (D) Pursuant to the terms of a contract awarded by the state of Arizona in September 2012, the state of Arizona has an option to purchase the Red Rock facility at any time during the term of the contract, including extension options, based on an amortization schedule starting with the fair market value and decreasing evenly to zero over the twenty year term. (E) We transitioned operations from the 1,154-bed San Diego Correctional Facility to the newly constructed 1,482-bed Otay Mesa Detention Center during the fourth quarter of 2015. The San Diego Correctional Facility was subject to a ground lease with the County of San Diego. Upon expiration of the lease on December 31, 2015, ownership of the facility automatically reverted to the County of San Diego. (F) These facilities are subject to purchase options held by the Georgia Department of Corrections, or GDOC, which grants the GDOC the right to purchase the facility for the lesser of the facility&#146;s depreciated book value, as defined, or fair market value at any time during the term of the contract between the GDOC and us. (G) The facility is subject to a deed of conveyance with the city of Wheelwright, Kentucky which includes provisions that allow assumption of ownership by the city of Wheelwright under the following occurrences: (1) we cease to operate the facility for more than two years, (2) our failure to maintain at least one employee for a period of sixty consecutive days, or (3) a conversion to a maximum security facility based upon classification by the Kentucky Corrections Cabinet. In December 2013, we entered into an agreement with the city of Wheelwright that extends the reversion by up to 30 months in exchange for $20,000 per month or until we resume operations, as defined in the agreement. (H) The facility is subject to a purchase option held by the Tallahatchie County Correctional Authority which grants Tallahatchie County Correctional Authority the right to purchase the facility at any time during the contract at a price generally equal to the cost of the premises less an allowance for amortization originally over a 20-year period. The amortization period was extended through 2050 in connection with an expansion completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. (I) The state of Montana has an option to purchase the facility generally at any time during the term of the contract with us at fair market value less the sum of a pre-determined portion of per diem payments made to us by the state of Montana. (J) The state of Ohio has the irrevocable right to repurchase the facility before we may resell the facility to a third party, or if we become insolvent or are unable to meet our obligations under the management contract with the state of Ohio, at a price generally equal to the fair market value, as defined in the Real Estate Purchase Agreement. (K) These facilities are subject to purchase options held by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, or ODC, which grants the ODC the right to purchase the facility at its fair market value at any time during the term of the contract with ODC. (L) As a result of a decline in California inmate populations held in our program during 2015, this facility was idled during the fourth quarter of 2015. We will continue to market the facility to other customers. (M) The state of Tennessee has the option to purchase the facility in the event of our bankruptcy, or upon an operational or financial breach, as defined, at a price equal to the book value of the facility, as defined. (N) The District of Columbia has the right to purchase the facility at any time during the term of the contract at a price generally equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments for the premises. Upon expiration of the lease in 2017, ownership of the facility automatically reverts to the District of Columbia. &#160;

Facilities Under Construction or Development 

As more fully described hereafter in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&#38;A, - Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;, we have one facility under construction or development. In connection with a new management contract with the Arizona Department of Corrections, our 1,596-bed Red Rock Correctional Center in Arizona is being expanded to a design capacity of 2,024 beds. We expect to complete construction and begin receiving up to an additional 1,000 inmates from Arizona under the new management contract beginning late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2016. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive strengths: 

The First and Largest Private Prison Owner. Our recognition as the nation&#146;s leading private prison owner and one of the largest prison operators in the United States provides us with significant credibility with our current and prospective clients. We believe we own approximately 59% of all privately owned prison beds in the United States and manage nearly 42% of all privately managed prison beds in the United States. We pioneered modern-day private prisons with a list of notable accomplishments, such as being the first company to design, build, and operate a private prison, the first company to manage a private maximum-security facility under a direct contract with the federal government, and the first company to purchase a government-owned correctional facility from a governmental agency in the United States and to manage the facility for the government agency. In addition to providing us with extensive experience and institutional knowledge, our size also helps us deliver value to our customers by providing purchasing power and allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale. 

Available Beds within Our Existing Facilities. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 9,200 beds at seven core correctional and detention facilities that are vacant and immediately available to use. We consider our core facilities to be those that were designed for adult secure correctional purposes. We have staff throughout the organization actively engaged in marketing this available capacity to existing and prospective customers. Historically, we have been successful in substantially filling our inventory of available beds and the beds that we have constructed. Filling these available beds would provide substantial growth in revenues, cash flow, and earnings per share. 

One of the Largest Community Corrections Owners and Operators in the United States. In the third quarter of 2015, we acquired four community corrections facilities from a privately held owner of community corrections facilities and other government leased assets. The four acquired community corrections facilities have a capacity of approximately 600 beds and are leased to Community Education Centers, Inc., or CEC, under triple net lease agreements that extend through July 2019 and include multiple five-year lease extension options. CEC separately contracts with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and the Philadelphia Prison System to provide rehabilitative and re-entry services to residents and inmates at the leased facilities. We acquired the four facilities in the real estate-only transaction as a strategic investment that expands our investment in the residential re-entry market. 

In the fourth quarter 2015, we closed on the acquisition of 100% of the stock of Avalon, along with two additional facilities operated by Avalon. Avalon, a privately held community corrections company that operates 11 community corrections facilities with approximately 3,000 beds in Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming, specializes in community correctional services, drug and alcohol treatment services, and residential re-entry services. Avalon 

&#160;

provides these services for various federal, state, and local agencies, many with which we currently partner. We acquired Avalon as a strategic investment that continues to expand the re-entry assets owned and services we provide. 

With the acquisitions of Avalon and the four community corrections facilities in Pennsylvania, we became one of the largest community corrections owners and operators in the United States. We believe this recognition provides us with a platform for growth. We also believe we have the opportunity to maximize utilization of available beds within our community corrections portfolio. The occupancy of the community corrections facilities that we acquired in the acquisition of Avalon was approximately 71% at the date of acquisition. 

Attractive REIT Profile. Key characteristics of our business make us a highly attractive REIT. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled 66 facilities containing approximately 15 million square feet which, for the year ended December 31, 2015, generated 98% of our net operating income, or our operating income before general and administrative expenses, asset impairments, depreciation, and amortization. Land and buildings comprise over 90% of our gross fixed assets. These valuable assets are located in areas with high barriers to entry, particularly due to the unique permitting and zoning requirements for these facilities. Further, the majority of our assets are constructed primarily of concrete and steel, generally requiring lower maintenance capital expenditures than other types of commercial properties. 

Since our inception, we have constructed dozens of facilities, many of which we subsequently expanded. We provide space and services under contracts with federal, state, and local government agencies that generally have credit ratings of single-A or better. In addition, a majority of our contracts have terms between one and five years, and we have historically experienced customer retention of approximately 90%, which contributes to our relatively predictable and stable revenue base. This stream of revenue combined with our low maintenance capital expenditure requirement translates into steady predictable cash flow. We believe the REIT structure also provides us with greater access to capital and flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. 

Development and Expansion Opportunitie s. The demand for capacity in the short-term has been affected by the budget challenges many of our government partners currently face. At the same time, these challenges impede our customers&#146; ability to construct new prison beds of their own or update older facilities, which we believe could result in further need for private sector capacity solutions in the long-term. We intend to continue to pursue build-to-suit opportunities like our 2,552-bed Trousdale Turner Correctional Center recently constructed in Trousdale County, Tennessee, and alternative solutions like the 2,400-bed South Texas Family Residential Center whereby we identified a site and lessor to provide residential housing and administrative buildings for ICE. We also expect to continue to pursue investment opportunities like the acquisition of the residential re-entry facilities in Pennsylvania and other real estate assets used to provide mission critical governmental services primarily in the criminal justice sector, as well as business combination transactions like the acquisition of Avalon. In the long-term, however, we would like to see meaningful utilization of our available capacity and better visibility from our customers before we add any additional prison capacity on a speculative basis. 

Proven Senior Management Team. Our senior management team has applied their prior experience and diverse industry expertise to improve our operations, related financial results, and capital structure. Under our senior management team&#146;s leadership, we have created new business opportunities with customers that have not previously utilized the private corrections sector, expanded relationships with existing customers, including all three federal correctional and detention agencies, converted to a REIT, completed several business 

&#160;

combination transactions, and successfully completed numerous recapitalization and refinancing transactions, resulting in increases in profitability and enhancing stockholder value. Our senior management team has an average of 20 years of experience working in the corrections industry. 

Financial Flexibility . As of December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $65.3 million and $446.5 million available under our revolving credit facility, with a total weighted average effective interest rate of 3.9% on all outstanding debt, while our total weighted average maturity on all outstanding debt was 5.6 years. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 8.7x and our debt leverage was 3.5x. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $399.8 million in cash through operating activities, and as of December 31, 2015, we had net working capital of $17.5 million. 

Business Str ategy 

Our primary business strategy is to provide prison bed capacity and quality corrections services, offer a compelling value, and increase occupancy and revenue, while maintaining our position as the leading owner, operator, and manager of privatized correctional and detention facilities. We may acquire additional correctional and re-entry facilities as well as other real estate assets used to provide mission critical governmental services primarily in the criminal justice sector, that we believe have favorable investment returns and increase value to our stockholders. We will also consider opportunities for growth, including, but not limited to, potential acquisitions of businesses within our line of business and those that provide complementary services, provided we believe such opportunities will broaden our market share and/or increase the services we can provide to our customers. 

Own and Operate High Quality Correctional and Detention Facilities . We believe that our government partners choose an outsourced correctional service provider based primarily on availability of beds, price, and the quality of services provided. Approximately 92% of the eligible facilities we operated as of December 31, 2015, excluding our community corrections facilities, are accredited by the ACA, an independent organization of corrections industry professionals that establishes standards by which a correctional facility may gain accreditation. We believe that this percentage compares favorably to the percentage of government-operated adult prisons that are accredited by the ACA. We have experienced wardens and administrators managing our facilities, with an average of 26 years of corrections experience. 

Offer Compelling Value. We believe that our government partners also seek a compelling value and service offering when selecting an outsourced correctional services provider. We believe that we offer a cost-effective alternative to our government partners by reducing their correctional services costs while allowing them to avoid long-term pension obligations for their employees and large capital investments in new prison beds. We attempt to improve operating performance and efficiency through the following key operating initiatives: (1) standardizing supply and service purchasing practices and usage; (2) implementing a standard approach to staffing and business practices in an effort to reduce our fixed expenses; (3) improving offender management, resource consumption, and reporting procedures through the utilization of numerous technological initiatives; (4) reconfiguring facility bed space to optimize capacity utilization; and (5) improving productivity and reducing employee turnover. Through ongoing company-wide initiatives, we continue to focus on efforts to contain costs and improve operating efficiencies, ensuring continuous delivery over the long-term. 

Through our strong commitment to community corrections and re-entry programs, we offer our government partners additional compelling opportunities. Our evidence-based re-entry 

&#160;

programs, including academic education, vocational training, substance abuse treatment, life skills training, and faith-based programming, are customizable based on partner needs and are applied utilizing best practices and/or industry standards. Through our efforts in community corrections and re-entry programs, we can provide consistency and common standards across facilities. We can also serve multiple levels of government on an as-needed basis, all toward reaching the goal we share with our government partners of providing offenders with the opportunity to succeed when they are released, making our communities safer, and, ultimately, reducing recidivism. 

We also intend to continue to implement a wide variety of specialized services that address the unique needs of various segments of the offender population. Because the offenders in the facilities we operate differ with respect to security levels, ages, genders, and cultures, we focus on the particular needs of an offender population and tailor our services based on local conditions and our ability to provide services on a cost-effective basis. 

Increase Occupancy and Revenue. Our industry benefits from significant economies of scale, resulting in lower operating costs per inmate as occupancy rates increase. We are pursuing a number of initiatives intended to increase our occupancy and revenue. Our competitive cost structure offers prospective government partners a compelling solution to incarceration. The unique budgetary challenges governments are facing may cause them to further rely on us to help reduce their costs, and also cause those states that have not previously utilized the private sector to turn to the private sector to help reduce their overall costs of incarceration. We are actively pursuing these opportunities. We are also focused on renewing and enhancing the terms of our existing contracts and expanding the services we provide under those contracts. We believe the long-term growth opportunities of our business remain very attractive as insufficient bed development by our government partners should result in future demand for additional bed capacity. Increases in occupancy could result in lower operating costs per inmate, resulting in higher operating margins, cash flow, and net income. 

Acquire Additional Community Corrections Facilities. We believe there is an opportunity to increase the utilization of community corrections facilities in the United States. We believe the demand for the housing and programs that community corrections facilities offer will continue to grow as offenders are released from prison and due to an increased awareness of the important role these programs play in an offender&#146;s successful transition from prison to society. Community corrections facilities offer housing and programs, with a key focus on employment, job readiness, and life skills, in order to help offenders successfully re-enter the community and reduce the risk of recidivism. We are actively pursuing opportunities to acquire additional community corrections facilities in order to provide these services to parolees and defendants and offenders who are serving their full sentence, the last portion of their sentence, waiting to be sentenced, or awaiting trial while supervised in a community environment. 

Own and Lease Correctional and Community Corrections Facilities. As an alternative to providing &#147;turn-key&#148; correctional bed space and services to our government partners, we also offer our customers an attractive portfolio of prison facilities that can be leased for various correctional needs. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into an agreement to lease our California City Correctional Center to the CDCR. The lease agreement includes a three-year base term with unlimited two-year renewal options upon mutual agreement. The lease of this facility provided California an immediate solution to help reach its population capacity goals, and exemplified our ability to react quickly to our partners&#146; needs with innovative and flexible solutions that make the best use of taxpayer dollars. In addition, in the third quarter of 2015, we acquired four community corrections facilities from a privately held owner of community corrections facilities and other government leased assets. The acquired facilities 

&#160;

have a capacity of approximately 600 beds and are leased to a third-party operator under triple net lease agreements that extend through July 2019 and include multiple five-year lease extension options. We intend to pursue additional opportunities like the acquisition of the four community corrections facilities and those with the CDCR to lease prison facilities to government and other third-party operators in need of correctional capacity. 

Capita l Strategy 

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $65.3 million and $446.5 million available under our revolving credit facility. We have no debt maturities until April 2020. 

We completed several refinancing transactions during 2015, the result of which will increase our interest expense in the future, but reduced our exposure to variable rate debt, extended our weighted average maturity, and increased the availability under our revolving credit facility. 

In July 2015, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to reduce by 0.25% the applicable margin of base rate and LIBOR loans, incorporate a net debt concept for the consolidated secured leverage and consolidated total leverage ratios, extend the maturity from December 2017 to July 2020, and to increase the size of the &#147;accordion&#148; feature. Following the amendment, our revolving credit facility has an aggregate principal capacity of $900.0 million and has an &#147;accordion&#148; feature that provides for uncommitted incremental extensions of credit in the form of increases in the revolving commitments or incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount up to an additional $350.0 million as requested by us, subject to bank approval. At our option, interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is based on either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% or at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% based on our leverage ratio. Our revolving credit facility includes a $30.0 million sublimit for swing line loans that enables us to borrow at the base rate from the Administrative Agent without advance notice. 

On September 25, 2015, we completed the offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due October 15, 2022. We used net proceeds from the offering to pay down a portion of our revolving credit facility. 

In October 2015, we obtained $100.0 million under a Term Loan under the &#147;accordion&#148; feature of our revolving credit facility. Interest rates under the Term Loan are the same as the interest rates under our revolving credit facility, except that the interest rate on the Term Loan is at a base rate plus a margin of 0.50% or at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75% during the first two fiscal quarters following closing of the Term Loan. We used net proceeds from the Term Loan to pay down a portion of our revolving credit facility. The Term Loan has a maturity of July 2020, with scheduled principal payments in years 2016 through 2020. 

These refinancing transactions created additional flexibility to execute our business strategies and enhanced our position for future growth. We expect to continue to finance our capital requirements through a prudent mix of debt and equity capital while maintaining our existing policies around a conservative leverage ratio. 

We reorganized our corporate structure to facilitate our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2013. To qualify and be taxed as a REIT, we generally are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including capital gains) each year. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be 

&#160;

at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain qualification and taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset, in whole or in part, our REIT distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Because as a REIT we are required to distribute a substantial portion of our cash generated from operations to stockholders as a dividend, growth opportunities may require more external capital resources than were required prior to our conversion to a REIT. During 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.54 in each quarter totaling $254.8 million for the year, compared with a total of $239.1 million during 2014 and $221.2 million during 2013. 

In addition to the cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility, we currently expect our REIT taxable income to be less than our operating cash flow, primarily due to the deductibility of non-cash expenses such as depreciation on our real estate assets. This liquidity provides us with the flexibility to (i) invest in additional facility acquisitions and developments, which could include acquisitions of facilities from government partners, third parties, or additional business combinations similar to the acquisition of Avalon, (ii) pay down debt, (iii) increase dividends to our stockholders, or (iv) repurchase our common stock. We also have the flexibility to issue debt or equity securities from time to time when we determine that market conditions and the opportunity to utilize the proceeds from the issuance of such securities are favorable. Such opportunities could include, but are not limited to, build-to-suit or additional acquisition opportunities that exceed our undistributed cash flow and that generate favorable investment returns. 

Government Re gulation 

Business Regulations 

The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulations, including educational, health care, and safety regulations, which are administered by many governmental and regulatory authorities. Some of the regulations are unique to the corrections industry. Facility management contracts typically include reporting requirements, supervision, and on-site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies. Corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards and, in some instances, facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation. Certain jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups. Our facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which we have contracts. Failure to comply with these regulations and contract requirements can result in material penalties or non-renewal or termination of facility management contracts. 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. As an owner of correctional and detention facilities, we have been subject to these laws, ordinances, and regulations as the result of our operation and management of correctional and detention facilities. Phase I environmental assessments have been obtained on substantially all of the properties we currently own. We are not aware of any environmental matters that are expected to materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, if such matters are detected in the future, the costs of complying with environmental laws may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Privacy and Security Requirements 

In 1996, Congress enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA was designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance, and protect the privacy and security of health-related information. 

Privacy regulations promulgated under HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally. The regulations also provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. Security regulations promulgated under HIPAA require that covered entities, including most health care providers, health clearinghouses, group health plans, and their business associates, implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. These privacy and security regulations require the implementation of compliance training and awareness programs for our health care service providers and selected other employees primarily associated with our employee medical plans. Further, covered entities and their business associates must provide notification to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. In a final rule released in January 2013, DHHS modified the breach notification requirement by creating a presumption that all non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. 

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, has strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA. ARRA broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of covered entities and requires DHHS to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. ARRA also increases the amount of the civil penalties, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. Further, ARRA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions for injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. In addition, under ARRA, DHHS is required to perform periodic HIPAA compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates. 

&#160;

In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing the privacy and security of patient health information and other identifying information. For example, federal and various state laws and regulations strictly regulate the disclosure of patient identifiable information related to substance abuse treatment. Further, various state laws and regulations require providers and other entities to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving certain types of individually identifiable health or financial information, and these requirements may be more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA and ARRA. These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties and compliance costs. 

Healthcare reform could have an impact on our business 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the &#147;Health Reform Law&#148;) were signed into law in the United States. Certain of the provisions that have increased our healthcare costs since 2010 include the removal of annual plan limits, the expansion of dependent child coverage up to age 26, the mandate that health plans provide 100% coverage on expanded preventive care, and, in 2014, the removal of pre-existing condition exclusions. In addition, beginning with the 2014 benefit year, we became subject to the three-year annual Transitional Reinsurance Fee, imposed in order to finance a temporary reinsurance fund established to stabilize individual premiums purchased through the federal and state insurance exchanges. Our healthcare costs may continue to be negatively affected in the future, depending upon regulatory guidance, elements of the law that are effective as of future dates, the impact the law could have on healthcare rates in general, and our response to these changes. While much of the added cost from the Health Reform Law has occurred, we anticipate added costs in the future due to provisions being phased in over time. Changes to our healthcare cost structure could have an impact on our business and operating costs. 

Beginning in 2016, the Health Reform Law requires applicable large employers to report to the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, information regarding health coverage offered to full-time employees. Compliance with the Health Reform reporting rules increases the cost of complying with the Health Reform Law and could impact our operating costs. 

Insu rance 

We maintain general liability insurance for all the facilities we operate, as well as insurance in amounts we deem adequate to cover property and casualty risks, workers&#146; compensation, and directors and officers liability. In addition, each of our leases with third parties provides that the lessee will maintain insurance on each leased property under the lessee&#146;s insurance policies providing for the following coverages: (i) fire, vandalism, and malicious mischief, extended coverage perils, and all physical loss perils; (ii) comprehensive general public liability (including personal injury and property damage); and (iii) workers&#146; compensation. Under each of these leases, we have the right to periodically review our lessees&#146; insurance coverage and provide input with respect thereto. 

Each of our management contracts and the statutes of certain states require the maintenance of insurance. We maintain various insurance policies including employee health, workers&#146; compensation, automobile liability, and general liability insurance. Because we are significantly self-insured for employee health, workers&#146; compensation, automobile liability, and general liability insurance, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience, and our ability to control our claims experience. Our insurance policies contain 

&#160;

various deductibles and stop-loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences. However, the nature of our self-insurance policies provides little protection for deterioration in overall claims experience or an increase in medical costs. We are continually developing strategies to improve the management of our future loss claims but can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful. However, unanticipated additional insurance expenses resulting from adverse claims experience or an increasing cost environment for general liability and other types of insurance could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. 

Em ployees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 14,055 employees. Of such employees, approximately 405 were employed at our corporate offices and approximately 13,650 were employed at our facilities and in our inmate transportation business. We employ personnel in the following areas: clerical and administrative, facility administrators/wardens, security, medical, quality assurance, transportation and scheduling, maintenance, teachers, counselors, chaplains, and other support services. 

Each of the facilities we currently operate is managed as a separate operational unit by the facility administrator or warden. All of these facilities follow a standardized code of policies and procedures. 

We have not experienced a strike or work stoppage at any of our facilities. Approximately 1,010 employees at five of our facilities are represented by labor unions. In the opinion of management, overall employee relations are good. 

Compe tition 

The correctional and detention facilities we own, operate, or manage, as well as those facilities we own but are managed by other operators, are subject to competition for inmates from other private prison managers. We compete primarily on the basis of bed availability, cost, the quality and range of services offered, our experience in the design, construction, and management of correctional and detention facilities, and our reputation. We compete with government agencies that are responsible for correctional facilities and a number of privatized correctional service companies, including, but not limited to, The GEO Group, Inc. and Management and Training Corporation. We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance. Other potential competitors may in the future enter into businesses competitive with us without a substantial capital investment or prior experience. We may also compete in the future for acquisitions and new development projects with companies that have more financial resources than we have or those willing to accept lower returns than we are willing to accept. Competition by other companies may adversely affect the number of inmates at our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating revenue of our facilities. In addition, revenue derived from our facilities will be affected by a number of factors, including the demand for inmate beds, general economic conditions, and the age of the general population.
