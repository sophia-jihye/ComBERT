 ITEM 1. BUSI NE SS 

&#160; 

We are an exploration stage mineral company. 

&#160;

On May 3, 2013, our consulting geologist acquired a 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining claim (hereafter the &#8220;Claim&#8221;) which held in trust for us. The Claim was located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada. It was located on provincial lands administered by the Province of Saskatchewan. The legal and ownership rights on the claim were limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable regulations. The Claim totaled roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 square miles in size and was located approximately 25 miles north of the community of Points North, Saskatchewan. 

&#160;

The Claim comprised an irregular shaped block approximately 3 miles long and one mile wide located approximately 6 miles east of a significant uranium occurrence known as Laroque Lake. Historic exploration work showed that the Claim was located within an area that has potential for uranium mineralization. 

&#160;

Exploration of our Claim was required before a determination as to its viability could be made. We intended to conduct the first phase of our exploration program commencing in the late fall of 2014. Upon the completion of the first phase and any additional exploration phase, we intended to request that our geological consultant review the results of each exploration program and report back to us with recommendations, if any, with regard to further exploration programs. Each exploration phase of our exploration program would be dependent upon a number of factors such as our geological consultant&#8217;s recommendations and our available funds. We planned to have our consulting geologist, Carl von Einsiedel, and his firm, Ram Explorations Ltd., perform Phase I of our exploration program. Ram Explorations was in the business of doing geological explorations and had capable staff on-board, or available through sub-contracting. 

&#160;

Our consulting geologist had recommended that Phase I of exploration work on our Claim should consist of prospecting to determine if samples of the Athabasca sandstone exposed on the ground within our mineral claim area, exhibited alterations typical of those associated with known uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin. The total estimated cost of the proposed Phase I program was $15,000. The initial prospecting would collect and assay "grab samples." This was a process whereby the prospector (in our case Carl von Einsiedel, P Geol and owner of Ram Explorations Ltd.) would reconnoiter the property, making maps of areas of interest taking samples and recording each sample on his sketched map. He would chip away at sandstone outcroppings with his geological hand pick and visually analyze samples through a magnifying eyepiece looking for alterations in the sandstone typical of those associated with known uranium deposits in the Athabasca Basin. This type of alteration is known as the &#8220;Illite&#8221; alteration. He would take the best 50 or so samples and send them to an assay laboratory for geochemical analysis to determine the extent of Illite alteration, if any, in each of the samples. In the event that our geological consultant recommended a further exploration program and if approved by our management, we would embark upon a Phase II mineral exploration program. The estimated cost of this Phase II exploration program was $140,000. 

&#160;

We had no proven, possible or implied reserves on our mineral Claim. Depending upon the outcome of our mineral exploration programs, an economic feasibility study would be undertaken to determine proven, possible and implied reserves prior to making any production decisions. We could expend many millions of dollars on exploration activities prior to determining if a feasibility study was warranted or not. 

&#160;

Our Claim remained in good standing until May 2015. The expenditure of $15,000 on that program would have extended the good standing date by one year. The minimum amount of exploration expenditure required to keep the Claim in good standing was either the payment of $15,000 annually to the Province of Saskatchewan for the first eight years or incurring at least $15,000 of exploration work on our Claim each year for the first eight years. Amounts expended over $15,000 per year in the first eight years would count as a credit for expenditures required in subsequent years. 

&#160;

We were unable to raise the necessary annual funding of $15,000 to keep the mineral Claim in good standing and in May 2015, the Company forfeited its legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining Claim, which was held in trust for the Company, for non-payment. As of the date of filing this Form 10K, the Company no longer holds a beneficial interest in the Claim. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business plan is to proceed with the acquisition and exploration of feasible mineral claims to determine whether there are commercially exploitable reserves of gold, silver and uranium. Our geological consulting firm is well experienced in the mineral exploration business and will provide us with the expected costs of exploration to determine the commercial viability of the prospect. 

Competition 

The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered, a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims. Our operations are not yet well-established and our resources at the present time are limited. We may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of any Mineral Claim. There is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities. If a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations. These factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist. 

&#160;

Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. 

&#160; 

Employees 

We have no employees as of the date of this prospectus other than Dale Rasmussen who serves as the Company&#8217;s President, CEO and CFO, and Mark Rodenbeck who serves as the Company&#8217;s Secretary. Our Officers receive no compensation for their services to the Company. 

Research and Development Expenditures 

We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation. 

Subsidiaries 

On November 10, 2011, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, MRC Exploration LLC, in the State of Nevada for the purpose of conducting our planned mineral exploration. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
