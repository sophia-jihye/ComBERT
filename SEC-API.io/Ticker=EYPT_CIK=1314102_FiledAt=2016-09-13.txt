 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Introduction 

Our Business 

We develop sustained-release drug delivery products primarily for the treatment of chronic eye diseases. Our products deliver drugs at a controlled and steady rate for months or years. We have developed three of only four sustained-release products approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases. Medidur&#153; for posterior segment uveitis, our lead product candidate, is in pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and ILUVIEN &#174; for diabetic macular edema (DME), our lead licensed product, is sold in the U.S. and three European Union (EU) countries. Our product development program is focused primarily on utilizing our two core technology platforms to deliver drugs and biologics to treat chronic diseases. Our strategy includes developing products independently while continuing to leverage our technology platforms through collaborations and license agreements as appropriate. 

Medidur, our most advanced development product, is designed to treat chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (posterior segment uveitis) for three years from a single injection. Injected into the eye in an office visit, Medidur is a tiny micro-insert that delivers a micro-dose of a corticosteroid to the back of the eye on a sustained basis. We are developing Medidur independently. 

The first of Medidur&#146;s two Phase 3 trials met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease through six months with high statistical significance (p less than 0.00000001; intent to treat analysis) and achieved encouraging safety results. The same high statistical significance for efficacy and encouraging safety results were maintained through 12 months of follow-up. Due to the high level of statistical significance 

&#160; 

achieved, we plan to file our EU marketing approval application (MAA) based on data from the first Phase 3 trial, rather than two trials. The MAA is planned for the first quarter of 2017. Enrollment in the second Phase 3 trial is expected to be completed in October 2016. Assuming favorable results, we plan to file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA in the third quarter of 2017. A utilization study of our new Medidur inserter with a smaller diameter needle, which is required for both our MAA and NDA, met its primary endpoint, ease of intravitreal administration. 

ILUVIEN, our most recently approved product, is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert that provides three years of treatment of DME from a single injection. ILUVIEN is substantially the same design as Medidur and delivers the same steroid, although it is injected using a larger diameter inserter. ILUVIEN was developed in collaboration with Alimera Sciences, Inc. (Alimera) and is licensed to and sold by Alimera. We are entitled to a share of the net profits (as defined) from Alimera&#146;s sales of ILUVIEN on a quarter-by-quarter, country-by-country basis. ILUVIEN has been sold in the U.S. since 2015, where it is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients previously treated with a course of corticosteroids without a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). ILUVIEN has been sold in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Germany since 2013 and in Portugal since 2015. ILUVIEN has marketing approvals in these and 14 other European countries for the treatment of chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. 

FDA-approved Retisert &#174; is an implant that provides sustained treatment of posterior segment uveitis for 30 months. Implanted in a surgical procedure, Retisert delivers the same corticosteroid as Medidur but in a larger dose. Retisert was co-developed with Bausch &#38; Lomb, to which it is licensed. We receive royalties from Retisert sales. 

We are seeking to develop products that use our Durasert&#153; and Tethadur&#153; technology platforms to deliver drugs and biologics to treat wet and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases. The sustained release, surgical implant to treat pain associated with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) we developed in collaboration with Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) is in an investigator-sponsored pilot study. We recently commenced the first of two investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies of an injectable, bioerodible micro-insert we developed to provide sustained delivery of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to treat wet AMD.

Strategy 

Our strategy is to use our proprietary Durasert and Tethadur drug delivery technology platforms to independently develop new drug delivery products that use already-approved drugs and biologics to better treat ophthalmic and other diseases, while continuing to leverage our technology platforms through collaborations and licenses with leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, institutions and others. We believe our technologies can provide sustained, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, resulting in improved therapeutic effectiveness, safer administration and better patient compliance and convenience, with reduced product development risk and cost. Our proven track record of three approved products, all providing sustained release of previously approved drugs, reflects the benefits of this strategy. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop Sustained Delivery of Off-Patent Drugs and Biologics. Many drugs and biologics are now, or will soon be, off-patent. It is estimated that over the next four years, patent coverage will end on products with world-wide sales aggregating billions of dollars annually. We plan to use our technology 

&#160; 

&#160; platforms to develop products that deliver off-patent and generic drugs and biologics with a significant market opportunity, where less frequent dosing through sustained delivery and/or targeted delivery at the treatment site would materially improve the effectiveness, safety or convenience of the original drugs or biologics. By focusing on delivery of already-approved drugs and biologics, particularly those requiring potentially shorter clinical development programs, we believe we can minimize the risks and financial investment required for product approval. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue Partnering with Leading Biopharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Companies. We intend to continue to partner with leading biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, institutions and others, where patent protection, development and regulatory costs, expertise and/or other factors make it desirable for us to have a partner. For example, drugs and biologics that might be more effectively delivered by our platform technologies or may have extended patent protection could make collaborations with the patent holders attractive. We may also seek to partner the development of products that could materially benefit from sustained delivery, but would require expensive clinical trials or are in treatment areas outside of our technical expertise. We may also seek to partner with companies with drugs coming off patent where our drug delivery technologies could offer an improved product and effectively extend the patent protection. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand Beyond Ophthalmology. While we continue to focus on our core ophthalmic competency, we intend to also use our technology platforms for the treatment of other diseases where sustained delivery could provide a significant advantage, such as osteoarthritis or for sustained systemic release of biologics. 

Market Opportunity for Delivery of Drugs and Biologics 

We develop products to address issues inherent in the delivery of drugs and biologics. The efficacy of a therapeutic agent (small drug molecule or biologic) depends on its distribution to, and reaction with, the targeted tissue and other tissues in the body, the duration of treatment and clearance from the body. In an ideal treatment, the appropriate amount of drug or biologic is delivered to the intended tissue at an appropriate concentration and that concentration is maintained at the tissue for a sufficient period of time to provide effective treatment without causing adverse effects to other tissues. Accordingly, the delivery of a drug or biologic can be an important element of its ultimate therapeutic value. 

Drugs are frequently administered systemically by oral dosing, infusion or injection and subsequently dispersed throughout the body via the circulatory system. In the case of many drugs, systemic administration does not deliver them to the intended site with an appropriate concentration for a sufficient duration or the appropriate concentration disperses too quickly or unevenly, thereby failing to achieve the maximum potential therapeutic benefit. Because systemically delivered drugs disperse throughout the body, they often are administered at higher dosage levels to achieve sufficient concentrations at the intended sites. This is particularly true for the eyes, joints, brain and nervous system, which have natural barriers that impede the movement of drugs to those areas. These higher dosage levels can cause harmful side effects to the tissues beyond the intended site. To avoid these issues, drugs may be administered locally to the targeted site, typically by injection. However, maintaining a sufficient concentration at the targeted site over time typically requires timely and repeated administration of systemically and locally delivered drugs. The delivery methods themselves can have risks. Repeated administration by injection or infusion can result in serious infections and other complications. 

Biologics generally cannot be administered orally, but instead are administered by repeated injections or infusions to maintain appropriate levels over the course of treatment. Due to their molecular size and complexity, it has been difficult to develop sustained-release formulations for biologics. 

Drugs or biologics are often not administered on the optimal schedule or at all, because patients do not self-administer as prescribed or do not get medical professional administration as required. The risk of patient noncompliance increases when treatment involves multiple products or complex or painful dosing regimens, as patients age or suffer cognitive impairment or serious illness, or when the treatment is lengthy or expensive. 

&#160; 

Treating retinal diseases is a significant challenge for drug delivery. Due to the effectiveness of the blood-eye barrier, it is difficult for systemically administered drugs to reach the retina in sufficient quantities to have a beneficial effect without causing adverse side effects to other parts of the body. Injecting drugs or biologics in solution directly into the back of the eye can achieve effective, but often transient, dosage levels in the eye, requiring repeated injections. Ophthalmic biologics, such as Lucentis &#174; and EYLEA &#174; , require injection into the eye as frequently as every four weeks. In addition to the issues of inconvenience, cost and noncompliance, repeated intravitreal injections have medical risks, including intraocular infection, perforated sclera and vitreous hemorrhage. 

Due to the drawbacks of traditional delivery, the development of methods to deliver drugs and biologics to patients in a more precise, controlled fashion over sustained periods of time has been a medical goal. Methods for sustained drug delivery include oral and injectable controlled-release products and skin patches that seek to improve the consistency of the dosage over time and extend the duration of delivery. However, most of these methods cannot provide constant, controlled dosage or sufficient duration of delivery, particularly in diseases that are chronic or require precise dosing. Moreover, skin patches and oral products still have issues of systemic delivery. There are currently very few approved sustained-delivery products for biologics. 

As a result of the issues with traditional delivery of drugs and biologics, there is significant market opportunity for delivery of these products on a sustained, controlled basis over an extended period directly to the targeted site. 

Our Technology Systems and Products 

Our two core technology platforms, Durasert and Tethadur, are designed to address the issues of sustained delivery for ophthalmic and other product candidates: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Extended Delivery . Our Durasert technology platform can deliver drugs for predetermined periods of time ranging from days to years. Our goal is to develop Tethadur to provide sustained delivery of biologics. We believe that uninterrupted, sustained delivery offers the opportunity to develop products that reduce the need for repeated applications, thereby reducing the risks of patient noncompliance and adverse effects from repeated administrations. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Controlled Release Rate . Our technology platforms are designed to release therapeutics at a sustained, controlled rate. We believe that this feature allows us to develop products that deliver optimal concentrations of therapeutics over time and eliminate excessive variability in dosing during treatment. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Localized Delivery . Our technology platforms can deliver therapeutics directly to a target site. This administration can allow the natural barriers of the body to isolate and assist in maintaining appropriate concentrations at the target site in an effort to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect while minimizing unwanted systemic effects. 

Durasert Technology System 

Our three approved products, our late stage product candidate for posterior segment uveitis and earlier stage product candidates for knee OA and AMD, use our Durasert technology platform to provide sustained, localized delivery of small molecule drugs to the back of the eye or the joint. In our Durasert products, a drug core is surrounded with one or more polymer layers, and the permeability of those layers and other design aspects of the product control the rate and duration of drug release. By changing elements of the design, we can alter both the rate and duration of release to meet different therapeutic needs. ILUVIEN is, and our ophthalmic product candidates are designed to be, injected at the target site in an office visit, while earlier ophthalmic products Retisert and Vitrasert are surgically implanted. Our osteoarthritis product candidate is surgically implanted in the joint.

&#160; CMV retinitis &#160; FDA-approved; commercialized from 1996 through 2012 (patent expiration) &#160; Bausch &#38; Lomb Development Product: Medidur for Posterior Segment Uveitis 

Medidur, our lead development product, is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert designed to treat chronic, noninfectious posterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis and panuveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye for three years from a single injection. Injected in an office visit, Medidur provides sustained release of 0.18 mg of the off-patent corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) at a controlled rate directly to the back of the eye over three years. Medidur is injected with our proprietary inserter that uses a 27-gauge needle. We are developing Medidur independently and have not licensed the rights to Medidur for posterior segment uveitis to Alimera or any other third party. 

Posterior segment uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, often involving the retina, and is a leading cause of blindness in the developed countries. It afflicts people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In the U.S., posterior segment uveitis is estimated to affect approximately 175,000 people, resulting in approximately 30,000 cases of blindness and making it the third leading cause of blindness in the U.S. Patients with posterior segment uveitis are typically treated with systemic steroids, but frequently develop serious side effects over time that can limit effective dosing. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapy with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects including an increased risk of cancer. 

Medidur Phase 3 Trials 

We are currently conducting two Phase 3 trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Medidur for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. These are randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials. The primary endpoint of both trials is recurrence of disease at six months, with patients followed for three years. Our first Phase 3 Medidur trial enrolled 129 patients in 16 centers in the U.S. and 17 centers outside the U.S, with 87 eyes treated with Medidur and 42 eyes randomized to control and receiving sham injections. We expect to complete enrollment of our second Phase 3 trial of approximately 150 patients in 15 centers in India in October 2016. 

Our first Phase 3 trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease at six months with high statistical significance (p less than 0.00000001; intent to treat analysis) (recurrence of 18.4% for 

&#160; 

Medidur versus 78.6% for control). The trial continued to meet its primary efficacy endpoint with the same high statistical significance through 12 months of follow up (p less than 0.00000001) (27.6% Medidur versus 85.7% control). Medidur was generally well tolerated through the latest follow-up visit reported (minimum 12 months, maximum 30 months, average 18 months). The incremental risk of elevated IOP for Medidur-treated eyes compared to control eyes was lower through the last follow up than through six months for over 21mmHg (8.3% versus 10.9%) as well as for the more serious elevation over 25mmHg (5.1% versus 11.3%). Elevated IOP was generally well treated with eye drops. Through the last follow-up, the percentage of eyes requiring incisional surgery was essentially the same in Medidur-treated and control eyes (4.6% versus 4.8%). Of the 64 study eyes with a natural lens at baseline, 45.2% of Medidur-treated eyes compared to 9.5% of control eyes required cataract surgery through the last follow-up visit. Cataracts are both a side effect of treatment with steroids and a natural consequence of posterior segment uveitis. 

Our multi-center, randomized, controlled, single-masked study of the safety and utilization of our new proprietary 27-gauge inserter for Medidur met its primary endpoint, ease of intravitreal administration, showing that it facilitated the administration of Medidur compared to the larger diameter, 25-gauge inserter. These study results will form part of our anticipated MAA and NDA filings for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis. 

Medidur Regulatory Strategy 

In the EU, we plan to submit an MAA to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2017 for Medidur for treatment of posterior segment uveitis. The submission is planned using the Centralized Procedure, which allows submission of a single application that, when approved, authorizes marketing in all EU member states and European Free Trade Association countries rather than requiring separate national approvals. As a result of the high statistical significance achieved in the first Phase 3 trial, we plan to base our MAA on data from only one rather than two Phase 3 trials. The U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advised us that, consistent with the published Points to Consider (PtC) of the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products, an application for a product treating a condition like posterior segment uveitis could be based on statistically compelling and clinically relevant results from just one pivotal trial. The submission will also be based on data from our inserter study and ILUVIEN for DME trials. 

The European Commission (EC) designated Medidur as an orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation provides up to 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe following marketing approval, access to the Centralized Procedure and other regulatory and financial incentives. 

In the U.S., we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA seeking approval of the marketing of Medidur for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. We plan to base the NDA on data from our two Phase 3 trials and the inserter utilization study, as well as data referenced from the ILUVIEN for DME trials. Pending favorable results in our second Phase 3 trial, we expect to file an NDA in the third quarter of 2017. We have not obtained orphan designation for Medidur for posterior segment uveitis in the U.S. and may not do so. 

Medidur Marketing Strategy 

To be prepared for the potential marketing approvals of Medidur, we have begun the process of evaluating how we could best commercialize Medidur and maximize its value to us. We do not currently have any sales or marketing staff or any in-house expertise on product commercialization, and our resources are limited. We will be reviewing all of our potential options with respect to Medidur commercialization, including whether we should have different approaches in different jurisdictions. 

Approved Product: ILUVIEN for DME 

ILUVIEN is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert delivering 0.19 mg of FAc to the back of the eye for treatment of DME. It is substantially the same micro-insert as Medidur. Injected in an office visit using a 

&#160; 

larger diameter 25-gauge inserter, ILUVIEN delivers 36 months of continuous, low-dose corticosteroid therapy with a single injection. ILUVIEN is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. In the 17 EU countries where ILUVIEN has been approved, it is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. DME is a disease suffered by diabetics where leaking capillaries cause swelling in the macula, the most sensitive part of the retina. DME is a leading cause of blindness in the working-age population in most developed countries. 

We licensed ILUVIEN to Alimera, with which we co-developed the product. Alimera has sold ILUVIEN in the U.K. and Germany since 2013 and in Portugal and the U.S. since 2015. ILUVIEN has marketing authorizations in 14 additional EU countries. We are entitled to a 20% share in net profits on sales of ILUVIEN by Alimera on a quarter-by-quarter, country-by-country basis. See &#147;Strategic Collaborations&#151;Alimera&#148; below. Alimera has sublicensed ILUVIEN in various countries. 

Approved Product: Retisert for Posterior Segment Uveitis 

Retisert is a sustained-release implant for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. Surgically implanted, it delivers 0.59 mg of FAc to the back of the eye for approximately 30 months. Retisert is licensed to Bausch &#38; Lomb, with which we co-developed the product. Approved in the U.S., Bausch &#38; Lomb sells the product and pays sales-based royalties to us. 

Approved Product: Vitrasert for CMV Retinitis 

Our first product Vitrasert was a sustained-release implant for the treatment of CMV retinitis, a blinding eye disease that occurs in individuals with advanced AIDS. Surgically implanted, Vitrasert provided sustained delivery of the anti-viral drug ganciclovir for six to eight months. Approved in the U.S. and EU, Vitrasert was licensed to Bausch &#38; Lomb, which discontinued sales in fiscal 2013 following patent expiration. 

Tethadur Technology System 

Our Tethadur technology system, currently in pre-clinical development, is designed to provide sustained delivery of large biologic molecules, including peptides, proteins and antibodies. Tethadur utilizes a tunable, biodegradable, biocompatible matrix of nanostructured silica. Biologics are loaded into the matrix and are then released over time as the matrix dissolves. We believe that by varying the pore size and surface area of Tethadur, the release rate of biologics loaded into the Tethadur matrix can be controlled. Our goal with Tethadur is to provide sustained delivery of biologics that currently must be delivered by frequent injections. The Tethadur matrix could also be designed to deliver smaller molecules. 

Development Pipeline 

Our research is focused on using our Durasert technology platform and developing our Tethadur delivery platform to deliver therapeutic agents to treat wet and dry AMD, glaucoma and osteoarthritis, as well as to provide systemic delivery of biologics. 

Development Product: Severe Knee Osteoarthritis Implant. 

We have developed an implant for the treatment of pain associated with severe knee OA in collaboration with HSS. This implant is being studied in an investigator-sponsored, pilot study. The implant is composed of a specially manufactured, surgical screw-like device with an embedded Durasert system that delivers dexamethasone directly to the joint on a sustained basis. Dexamethasone is an off-patent corticosteroid that is frequently used for the treatment of OA. Implanted in the non-articulating area of the knee in an outpatient procedure, the implant is designed to provide long-term pain relief and thereby delay the need for knee replacement surgery. This implant represents the first use of our Durasert technology outside of ophthalmology. We believe this design, if successful, could be adapted for severe OA in other joints. 

&#160; 

Knee OA is a degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, with joint pain and stiffness the most common symptoms. More than 10 million people have knee OA. No cure exists, but pain and movement restriction associated with the disease are currently treated with oral analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids taken orally or injected into the knee, or hyaluronic acid injected into the knee. With degeneration, damage and pain from knee OA can become severe, making it the leading cause of total knee replacement surgery. More than 700,000 of these surgeries were performed last year in the U.S. alone, and the number is expected to grow. 

Development Product: TKI Insert for Wet AMD. We are developing an injectable, bioerodible, sustained-release Durasert insert delivering a TKI for treatment of wet AMD. AMD, the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65, is most commonly treated with intravitreal injections of biologics that block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) molecules. FDA-approved Lucentis and Eylea and off-label use of the anti-cancer Avastin &#174; , all of which block only VEGF, are the leading treatments for wet AMD. These biologics must be injected into the eye as frequently as monthly and typically lose efficacy over time, resulting in vision loss and return of the disease. 

Although the exact cause of AMD is unknown, other growth factors in addition to VEGF such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are thought to be involved in AMD. Approved for the treatment of cancer, some TKIs, including the one we propose to use in our insert, are known to inhibit PDGF as well as VEGF. In cancer therapy, TKIs are taken orally, but their toxicity prevents their systemic use to treat AMD. By using our Durasert technology, we plan to deliver a TKI directly to the back of the eye with a total dose that is significantly lower than is used in a course of cancer therapy. 

Our goal is to provide sustained treatment of wet AMD for six months with a single injection, targeting both VEGF and PDGF while avoiding the toxic systemic side effects of TKIs and the frequent injections of current AMD anti-VEGF biologics. Our completed pre-clinical study data demonstrated that a TKI delivered by a sustained release insert was comparably efficacious to a commercially available biologic indicated for wet AMD delivered by injection in both preventing choroidal neovascularization and reducing vascular leakage. On the basis of these studies, we have commenced the first of two IND-enabling studies. 

Feasibility Study Agreements 

We enter into feasibility study agreements (some of which are funded by third parties) to evaluate our Durasert and Tethadur technology systems for the treatment of ophthalmic and other diseases. 

Strategic Collaborations 

We have entered into a number of collaboration/license agreements to develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies. In all of these collaboration agreements, we have retained the right to use and develop the underlying technologies outside of the scope of the exclusive licenses granted. 

Alimera 

In a February 2005 collaboration agreement, as amended and restated in March 2008, we granted Alimera an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture, develop, market and sell ILUVIEN for the treatment and prevention of human eye diseases other than uveitis. We also granted Alimera a worldwide non-exclusive license to manufacture, develop, market and sell certain additional Durasert-based products (1) to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery method to the back of the eye solely for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis or (2) to treat DME in humans by delivering a compound by a direct delivery method through an incision no smaller than that required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. The non-exclusive license is limited to those products that, among other things, (i) have a drug core within a polymer layer (with certain limitations regarding chemically bonded combinations of active agents) and (ii) are approved, 

&#160; 

or designed to be approved, to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery to the posterior portion of the eye, or to treat DME by delivering a compound by a direct delivery through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We are not permitted to use, or grant a license to any third party to use, the licensed technologies to make or sell any products that are or would be subject to the non-exclusive license granted to Alimera. 

In October 2014, Alimera paid us a $25.0 million milestone upon FDA approval of ILUVIEN as provided in our collaboration agreement. We are entitled to receive 20% of any net profits (as defined) on sales by Alimera of each licensed product (including ILUVIEN), measured on a quarter-by-quarter and country-by-country basis. Alimera may recover 20% of previously incurred and unapplied net losses (as defined) for commercialization of each product in a country by offsetting up to 4% of the net profits earned in that country for that product each quarter, effectively reducing our profit share to not less than 16% until those net losses are recouped. If Alimera sublicenses commercialization in any country, we are entitled to 20% of royalties and 33% of non-royalty consideration received by Alimera, less certain permitted deductions. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for the other party&#146;s uncured material breach under various conditions and upon various bankruptcy events. 

Bausch &#38; Lomb 

Under a 2003 amended license agreement, Bausch &#38; Lomb has a worldwide exclusive license to make and sell Retisert and other first generation products defined in the agreement in return for royalties based on sales. We agreed with Bausch &#38; Lomb not to develop, license or commercialize a product designed to receive regulatory approval to treat uveitis, but only for so long as (i) Bausch &#38; Lomb is actively commercializing a product the net sales of which bear the base royalty payable to us that is not subject to any royalty reduction or offset and (ii) Bausch &#38; Lomb has not developed or commercialized a uveitis product that does not bear such royalties. This agreement also covered Vitrasert prior to patent expiration. Bausch &#38; Lomb can terminate its agreement with us without penalty at any time upon 90 days&#146; written notice. 

Pfizer 

Our June 2011 Amended and Restated Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer (the Restated Pfizer Agreement) provides Pfizer an exclusive option, under various circumstances, to license the development and commercialization of a sustained release bioerodible implant to deliver latanoprost by subconjunctival injection (the Latanoprost Product) worldwide for human ophthalmic disease or conditions other than uveitis. Under the Restated Pfizer Agreement, at our discretion and expense, we can develop the Latanoprost Product through Phase 2 clinical trials. If we cease development, or if we commence and complete Phase 2 clinical trials, Pfizer may exercise its option at either juncture in exchange for payments of prescribed, but different levels of, license fee and potential future milestones plus royalties. If Pfizer does not exercise any such option, the Restated Pfizer Agreement will automatically be terminated. 

Either Pfizer or we may terminate the Restated Pfizer Agreement for various reasons, including the other party&#146;s uncured material breach or upon various bankruptcy events. Pfizer may terminate this agreement at its sole discretion on 60 days&#146; notice. In the event Pfizer so terminates, or if we terminate for Pfizer&#146;s material breach, we have the right to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product. 

Pfizer owned approximately 5.4% of our outstanding stock as of August 31, 2016. 

Enigma Therapeutics 

Our December 2012 license agreement, amended and restated in March 2013, with Enigma Therapeutics Limited (Enigma) provides Enigma with an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the development of BrachySil (now named OncoSil&#153;), a product candidate for the treatment of pancreatic and other cancers. We 

&#160; 

received an upfront fee of $100,000 and are entitled to an 8% sales-based royalty, 20% of sublicense consideration and milestones based on aggregate product sales. Enigma is obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $100,000, creditable during each ensuing twelve-month period against reimbursable patent maintenance costs and sales-based royalties. Annual license maintenance fees of $100,000 were paid in January 2014, January 2015 and December 2015. Enigma has the right to terminate this license upon 60 days&#146; prior written notice.

Our clinical and pre-clinical research programs primarily focus on ophthalmic applications of our technology systems. Our research and development expenses totaled $14.4 million in fiscal 2016, $12.1 million in fiscal 2015 and $9.6 million in fiscal 2014. Of these amounts, $12.8 million in fiscal 2016, $10.6 million in fiscal 2015 and $8.2 million in fiscal 2014 were incurred for costs of research and development personnel, clinical and pre-clinical studies, contract services, testing and laboratory facilities. The remaining expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2016, $1.5 million in fiscal 2015 and $1.4 million in fiscal 2014 consisted of non-cash charges for amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and stock-based compensation expense specifically allocated to research and development personnel. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we consolidated all of our research and development operations in our facility in Watertown, Massachusetts. We closed our research facility in Malvern, U.K. and have terminated the employment of all of our employees in that location. 

Intellectual Property 

We own or license patents in the U.S. and other countries. Our patents generally cover the design, formulation, manufacturing methods and use of our sustained release therapeutics, devices and technologies. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Patent term extension may be available in various countries to compensate for a patent office delay or a regulatory delay in approval of the product. 

The U.S. patent with which Retisert is marked expires in March 2019. The latest expiring patent covering ILUVIEN and Medidur expires in August 2027 in the U.S. and in October 2024 in the EU, although extensions have been obtained or applied for through May 2027 in various EU countries. 

The following table provides general details relating to our owned and licensed patents (including both patents that have been issued and applications that have been accepted for issuance) and patent applications as of August 31, 2016:

&#160; Employees 

We had 20 employees as of August 31, 2016. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

We currently manufacture our product candidates for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We purchase raw materials necessary to manufacture Medidur and our other product candidates in the ordinary course of business, and they are available from multiple sources. The manufacture of Retisert and ILUVIEN is the responsibility of our licensees. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial quantities of our product candidates. If Medidur is approved, we may perform initial commercial manufacture in our current facility, but we expect to arrange for long-term manufacture by contract manufacturers or licensees. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have no marketing or sales staff. We currently depend on collaborative partners to market our products. Significant additional expenditures would be required for us to develop an independent sales and marketing organization. 

Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls 

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of pharmaceutical products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private health plans. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of pharmaceutical products or require discounts. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. 

U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (Healthcare Reform Law), was enacted in 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. In the EU, governments may set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization. In recent years, EU governments have considered or implemented various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and mandatory rebates, and EU governments likely will continue to use these and other cost-containment measures, including value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). 

Competition 

The market for products treating back-of-the-eye diseases is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We face substantial competition for our products and product candidates. Pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, as well as research organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists, have developed and are seeking to develop drugs, therapies and novel delivery methods to treat diseases targeted by our products and product candidates. Most of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, better established, more experienced and have substantially more resources than we or our partners have. Competitors may reach the market earlier, may have obtained or could obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our products and potential products, and may offer products with greater efficacy, lesser or fewer side effects and/or other competitive advantages. We believe that competition for treatments of back-of-the-eye diseases is based upon the effectiveness of the treatment, side effects, time to market, reimbursement and price, reliability, ease of administration, availability, patent position, and other factors. 

Many companies have or are pursuing products to treat back-of-the-eye diseases that are or would be competitive with ILUVIEN or Medidur. Some of these products and potential products include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; DME . Genentech USA Inc.&#146;s Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical&#146;s EYLEA (afibercept) are approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of DME. Roche&#146;s lower-cost 

&#160; 

&#160; Avastin &#174; is approved to treat various cancers, but is used off-label for treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Studies are ongoing on the use of Avastin in back-of-the-eye diseases. Genentech is a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group. Novartis AG has the right to market and sell Lucentis outside of the U.S. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA in the U.S., and Bayer HealthCare owns the exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S. Lucentis, EYLEA and Avastin are all injected into the back of the eye on a regular basis. Allergan, Inc.&#146;s Ozurdex &#174; (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), a bioerodible, extended release intravitreal implant, has been approved for the treatment of DME in eyes that have had, or are scheduled for, cataract surgery. It has a duration of therapy of several months. Other companies, including Genentech, are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of DME, including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors, as well as use of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) that modulate gene expression. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Posterior segment uveitis . Periocular steroid injections and systemic delivery of corticosteroids are used to treat posterior segment uveitis. Ozurdex is approved in the U.S. and EU for posterior segment uveitis. Abbvie recently obtained FDA approval for Humira &#174; for posterior segment uveitis, and other companies have ongoing trials of posterior segment uveitis treatments, including Clearside&#146;s CLS-TA and Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.&#146;s sirolimus drug DE-109.

&#160; Government Regulation 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of drug products. 

Drug Development, Approval, and Regulation in the U.S. The steps required by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an NDA to obtain marketing approval; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing sites identified in the NDA; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Pre-clinical tests intended for submission to the FDA must be conducted in compliance with FDA&#146;s current Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and the U.S.Department of Agriculture&#146;s Animal Welfare Act. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and protocols for proposed human clinical trials, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before the IND sponsor may begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Pre-clinical trials do not necessarily result in the submission of an IND and submission of an IND does not necessarily result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA&#146;s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the criteria for determining subject eligibility, the dosing plan, patient monitoring requirements, timely reporting of adverse events, and other elements necessary to ensure patient safety, and any efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EComm). The IRB/EComm&#146;s role is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in clinical studies by evaluating, among other things, the potential risks and benefits to subjects, processes for obtaining informed consent, monitoring of data to ensure subject safety, and provisions to protect the subjects&#146; privacy. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data. 

Some clinical trials, called &#147;investigator-sponsored&#148; clinical trials, are conducted by third-party investigators responsible for the regulatory obligations associated with sponsorship of a clinical trial. The results of these trials may be used as supporting data in an application for FDA approval, if appropriate, provided that the applicant has contractual rights to use the results. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1 : Phase 1 trials are initially conducted in a limited number of human subjects, usually health human subjects, to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2 : Phase 2 trials are usually conducted in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3 : Phase 3 trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#147;pivotal&#148; studies, which typically denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve the product candidate. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with larger numbers of patients to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. 

In the case of products for life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, or severe conditions such as blinding eye disease, or for products that require invasive delivery, initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the targeted disease or condition, these studies may provide preliminary evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 trials, and so these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1/2 or 2a trials. 

Clinical trials may be suspended by the sponsor or by the FDA or IRB/EComm at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition and proposed labeling of the product candidate are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the product for a proposed indication. The fees payable to the FDA for reviewing an NDA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. The FDA has a statutorily mandated goal of responding to standard review NDAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is often extended. The first indication of the FDA&#146;s review progress is provided at the mid-cycle review. This typically occurs approximately five months after the NDA is submitted. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional clinical data. Even if the additional data are submitted, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 

Satisfaction of FDA new drug approval requirements typically takes several years or more, and varies substantially. The FDA may delay approval of product candidates for a considerable period of time or fail to grant approval at all, and may require additional trials or other costly procedures in order to obtain regulatory approval, which delay or render impossible or impractical obtaining FDA approval. The time and expense required to obtain FDA approval for regulated products can exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product.. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the product. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to confirm that the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses. The FDA may also require surveillance programs to monitor approved products or changes in labeling. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-approval programs. FDA approval may also be subject to the manufacturers&#146; continued adherence to a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. REMS, which are tailored to specifically address the risks of a given drug, may contain elements that restrict distribution of the drug to certain physicians, pharmacists and patients, or that require the use of communication tools such as letters to healthcare providers and patients detailing the risks associated with the drug. 

After approval, certain changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. 

&#160; 

For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, but excluding efficacy supplements to an NDA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA and requests for additional information or clarification. 

Once a product approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may expose us to product liability claims and result in other consequences, including 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Any drug product manufactured or distributed under FDA approval is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation. All manufacturers must comply with regulations related to requirements for record-keeping and reporting adverse experiences with the product. Commercial drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), which impose procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

Foreign Regulation of Drug Development, Approval, and Marketing. Countries outside the U.S. also have regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials conducted in and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products sold in their countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely by country. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained, requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of a product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. 

The drug approval process varies from country to country, can involve additional testing beyond that required by FDA, and the time required for these approvals may be substantially longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by other countries, and approval in one country does not assure approval in any other country. 

&#160; 

Under the EU regulatory system, marketing authorizations are submitted under either the centralized procedure or one of the national authorization procedures. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Centralized procedure . The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the EC on the basis of a positive opinion by the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EC following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; National authorization procedures . There are also two other routes to obtain marketing authorization of medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of EU member states by the competent authorities of other EU member states. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of a EU member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU member state for the same medicinal product. 

Similar to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU member states both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. This includes control of compliance by the entities with EU cGMP rules, which govern quality control of manufacturing processes, methods and equipment and require documentation policies and procedures. Failure by authorization holders, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws, the related national laws of individual EU member states or the laws of other foreign regulatory authorities governing the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, import, export, advertising or promotion of our drug products may result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties. 

Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or supplemental NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of 

&#160; 

the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan exclusivity period. Orphan exclusivity prevents FDA from approving any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. This exclusivity does not prevent a competitor from obtaining approval to market a different product that treats the same disease or condition or the same product to treat a different disease or condition. 

Medicinal products are eligible for orphan designation in the EU if they meet each of the following requirements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the product must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 

The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity during which competent authorities of the EU member states, the EMA and the EC are not permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year exclusivity period if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities or if the latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may also be reduced to six years if, at the end of the orphan product&#146;s fifth year on the market, it can be demonstrated that the product is sufficiently profitable so as not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Healthcare Law and Regulation. Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payers and other healthcare customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries and jurisdictions. Within the U.S., these laws generally apply to pharmaceutical companies once the companies have marketed products or marketed products reimbursable by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Such U.S. federal healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly engaging in certain activities, including presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law require manufacturers of drugs, devices and medical supplies to report to the federal government information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. 

Within the U.S., analogous state laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by governmental as well as non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers. Foreign laws may also seek to prevent fraud and abuse. 

Laws and regulations have been enacted by various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government and/or require disclosure to the government and public of financial interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses (which are entities that process or facilitate the processing of nonstandard data elements of health information into standard data elements, or vice versa) and certain of their contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and they often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Other Laws. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
