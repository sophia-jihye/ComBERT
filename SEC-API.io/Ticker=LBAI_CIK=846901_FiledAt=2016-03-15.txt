 ITEM 1 - Business. 

GENERAL 

Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Lakeland Bancorp&#148;) is a bank holding company headquartered in Oak Ridge, New Jersey. The Company was organized in March of 1989 and commenced operations on May 19, 1989, upon the consummation of the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Lakeland Bank, formerly named Lakeland State Bank (&#147;Lakeland&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148; or &#147;Lakeland Bank&#148;). Through Lakeland, the Company operates 53 banking offices, located in Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey; five New Jersey regional commercial lending centers in Bernardsville, Montville, Newton, Teaneck and Wyckoff/Waldwick; and two commercial loan production offices serving Middlesex and Monmouth counties in New Jersey and the Hudson Valley region of New York. Lakeland offers an extensive suite of financial products and services for businesses and consumers. 

The Company has shown substantial growth through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Since 1998, Lakeland has opened (including acquired branches) a net total of 32 branch offices, and currently maintains 53 branch offices. The Company has acquired six community banks with an aggregate asset total of approximately $1.5 billion, including the acquisition of Pascack Community Bank and its parent, Pascack Bancorp, Inc. (&#147;Pascack Bancorp&#148;), which closed on January 7, 2016. All of the acquired banks have been merged into Lakeland and their holding companies, if applicable, have been merged into the Company. 

Lakeland Bancorp, Lakeland Bank and Harmony Bank signed a merger agreement on February 17, 2016, pursuant to which Harmony Bank will be merged with and into Lakeland Bank, with Lakeland Bank as the surviving bank. The merger agreement provides that shareholders of Harmony Bank will receive 1.25 shares of Lakeland Bancorp common stock for each share of Harmony Bank common stock that they own at the effective time of the merger. Lakeland Bancorp expects to issue an aggregate of approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock in the merger and will cash out Harmony Bank options that remain outstanding at the effective time of the merger. The closing of the merger is subject to receipt of approvals from regulators, approval of the merger by Harmony Bank&#146;s shareholders and other customary conditions. Harmony Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank that focuses on serving consumers and small-to-medium-size businesses, is headquartered in Jackson, New Jersey, with additional branch offices in Lakewood and Toms River, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2015, Harmony Bank had total assets, total loans, total deposits and total stockholders&#146; equity of $295 million, $241 million, $257 million and $28 million, respectively. 

At December 31, 2015, Lakeland Bancorp had total consolidated assets of $3.9 billion, total consolidated deposits of $3.0 billion, total consolidated loans, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, of $2.9 billion and total consolidated stockholders&#146; equity of $400.5 million. Following the closing of Lakeland Bancorp&#146;s acquisition of Pascack Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, Pascack Community Bank, on January 7, 2016, Lakeland Bancorp&#146;s total assets approximated $4.3 billion. 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (&#147;Forward-Looking Statements&#148;). Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such Forward-Looking Statements. Certain factors which could materially affect such results and the future performance of the Company are described in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Unless otherwise indicated, all weighted average, actual shares and per share information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of stock dividends, including the Company&#146;s 5% stock dividend which was distributed on June 17, 2014. 

&#160; 

Commercial Bank Services 

Through Lakeland, the Company offers a broad range of lending, depository, and related financial services to individuals and small to medium sized businesses located primarily in northern and central New Jersey, the Hudson Valley region in New York, and surrounding areas. In the lending area, these services include short and medium term loans, lines of credit, letters of credit, inventory and accounts receivable financing, real estate construction loans, mortgage loans and merchant credit card services. In addition to commercial real estate loans, Lakeland makes commercial and industrial loans. These types of loans can diversify the Company&#146;s exposure in a depressed real estate market. Lakeland&#146;s equipment financing division provides a solution to small and medium sized companies who prefer to lease equipment over other financial alternatives. Lakeland&#146;s asset based loan department provides commercial borrowers with another lending alternative. 

Depository products include demand deposits, as well as savings, money market and time accounts. The Company also offers wire transfer, internet banking, mobile banking and night depository services to the business community and municipal relationships. In addition, Lakeland offers cash management services, such as remote capture of deposits and overnight sweep repurchase agreements. 

Consumer Banking 

Lakeland also offers a broad range of consumer banking services, including checking accounts, savings accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, internet banking, secured and unsecured loans, consumer installment loans, mortgage loans, and safe deposit services. 

As a result of the merger with Somerset Hills Bancorp in 2013, Lakeland expanded its mortgage division by acquiring a mortgage company subsidiary, which originates and sells residential mortgage loans, and a 50% interest in a title company. 

Other Services 

Investment and advisory services for individuals and businesses are also available. 

Competition 

Lakeland faces considerable competition in its market areas for deposits and loans from other depository institutions. Many of Lakeland&#146;s depository institution competitors have substantially greater resources, broader geographic markets, and higher lending limits than Lakeland and are also able to provide more services and make greater use of media advertising. In recent years, intense market demands, economic pressures, increased customer awareness of products and services, and the availability of electronic services have forced banking institutions to diversify their services and become more cost-effective. 

Lakeland also competes with credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies and other financial companies, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restrictions as Lakeland in attracting deposits and making loans. Interest rates on deposit accounts, convenience of facilities, products and services, and marketing are all significant factors in the competition for deposits. Competition for loans comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, insurance companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, mortgage banking firms and other institutional lenders. Lakeland primarily competes for loan originations through its structuring of loan transactions and the overall quality of service it provides. Competition is affected by the availability of lendable funds, general and local economic conditions, interest rates, and other factors that are not readily predictable. 

The Company expects that competition will continue in the future. 

&#160; 

Concentration 

The Company is not dependent for deposits or exposed by loan concentrations to a single customer or a small group of customers the loss of any one or more of which would have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the Company. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 551 full-time equivalent employees. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company considers relations with its employees to be good. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

General 

The Company is a registered bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;Holding Company Act&#148;), and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Holding Company Act. The Company is subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. 

Lakeland is a state chartered banking association subject to supervision and examination by the Department of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey (the &#147;Department&#148;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;). The regulations of the State of New Jersey and FDIC govern most aspects of Lakeland&#146;s business, including reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, and location of branch offices. Lakeland is subject to certain restrictions imposed by law on, among other things, (i) the maximum amount of obligations of any one person or entity which may be outstanding at any one time, (ii) investments in stock or other securities of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. 

The Holding Company Act 

The Holding Company Act limits the activities which may be engaged in by the Company and its subsidiaries to those of banking, the ownership and acquisition of assets and securities of banking organizations, and the management of banking organizations, and to certain non-banking activities which the Federal Reserve Board finds, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling a bank as to be a proper incident thereto. The Federal Reserve Board is empowered to differentiate between activities by a bank holding company or a subsidiary thereof and activities commenced by acquisition of a going concern. 

With respect to non-banking activities, the Federal Reserve Board has by regulation determined that several non-banking activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the Holding Company Act and thus may be performed by bank holding companies. Although the Company&#146;s management periodically reviews other avenues of business opportunities that are included in that regulation, the Company has no present plans to engage in any of these activities other than providing investment brokerage services. 

With respect to the acquisition of banking organizations, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may, by merger, purchase or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, if, after such acquisition, it will own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. 

Regulation of Bank Subsidiaries 

There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its 

&#160; 

holding company&#146;s non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Each bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions. 

Commitments to Affiliated Institutions 

The policy of the Federal Reserve Board provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such subsidiary banks in circumstances in which it might not do so absent such policy. 

Interstate Banking 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in states other than their home state, regardless of applicable state law. New Jersey enacted legislation to authorize interstate banking and branching and the entry into New Jersey of foreign country banks. New Jersey did not authorize de novo branching into the state. However, under federal law, federal savings banks, which meet certain conditions, may branch de novo into a state, regardless of state law. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) removes the restrictions on interstate branching contained in the Riegle-Neal Act, and allows national banks and state banks to establish branches in any state if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#147;Modernization Act&#148;) became effective in early 2000. The Modernization Act: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than previously was permissible, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company, it files a certification, effective in 30 days, and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals (Lakeland Bancorp is such a financial holding company); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. 

The Modernization Act also modified other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. 

The USA PATRIOT Act 

As part of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (collectively, the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;). By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act encourages information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a 

&#160; 

broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

Among other requirements, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act imposes the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All financial institutions must establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum: (i) internal policies, procedures, and controls; (ii) specific designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training programs; and (iv) an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, in conjunction with other bank regulators, was authorized to issue regulations that provide for minimum standards with respect to customer identification at the time new accounts are opened. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Financial institutions that establish, maintain, administer, or manage private banking accounts or correspondent accounts in the United States for non-United States persons or their representatives (including foreign individuals visiting the United States) are required to establish appropriate, specific and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and report money laundering. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Financial institutions are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks (foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country), and will be subject to certain record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company&#146;s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications. 

The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of implementing regulations which address various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and are applicable to financial institutions such as Lakeland. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Banking agencies have strictly enforced various anti-money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;SOA&#148;) added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporpate reporting, to increase corporate responsibility and to protect investors. 

The SOA addresses, among other matters: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; audit committees for all reporting companies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer&#146;s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a prohibition on insider trading during pension plan black out periods; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers (other than loans made by an insured depository institution (as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expedited filing requirements for Form 4&#146;s; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a Form 8-K for a change or waiver of such code; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; &#147;real time&#148; filing of periodic reports; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; auditor independence; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; various increased criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) has enacted various rules to implement various provisions of the SOA with respect to, among other matters, disclosure in periodic filings pursuant to the Exchange Act. Each of the national stock exchanges, including the NASDAQ Stock Market where Lakeland Bancorp&#146;s common stock is listed, have corporate governance listing standards, including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards, and requiring the adopting of charters for the nominating, corporate governance and audit committees. 

Regulation W 

Transactions between a bank and its &#147;affiliates&#148; are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act applies Sections 23A and 23B to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board has also issued Regulation W, which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Regulation W incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank&#146;s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. The Company is considered to be an affiliate of Lakeland. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in &#147;covered transactions&#148; with affiliates: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; to an amount equal to 10% of the bank&#146;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; to an amount equal to 20% of the bank&#146;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates. 

In addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. A &#147;covered transaction&#148; includes: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. 

&#160; 

In addition, under Regulation W: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; with some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by certain types of collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130%, depending on the type of collateral, of the amount of the loan or extension of credit. 

Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve Board decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;), as implemented by FDIC regulations, a state bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#146;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the bank&#146;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the bank. Under the FDIC&#146;s CRA evaluation system, the FDIC focuses on three tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution&#146;s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution&#146;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution&#146;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Lakeland Bank received an &#147;outstanding&#148; CRA rating in its most recent examination. 

Securities and Exchange Commission 

The common stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. As a result, the Company and its officers, directors, and major stockholders are obligated to file certain reports with the SEC. The Company is subject to proxy and tender offer rules promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act. You may read and copy any document the Company files with the SEC at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information about the Public Reference Room. The SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, such as the Company. 

The Company maintains a website at http://www.lakelandbank.com . The Company makes available on its website the proxy statements and reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q that it files with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Additionally, the Company has adopted and posted on its website a Code of Ethics that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The Company intends to disclose any amendments to or waivers of the Code of Ethics on its website. 

Effect of Government Monetary Policies 

The earnings of the Company are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had, and will likely continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of 

&#160; 

commercial banks through the Board&#146;s power to implement national monetary policy in order to, among other things, curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve Board has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate of borrowings of banks and the reserve requirements against bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary fiscal policies. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from Lakeland. Virtually all of the revenue of the Company available for payment of dividends on its capital stock will result from amounts paid to the Company by Lakeland. All such dividends are subject to various limitations imposed by federal and state laws and by regulations and policies adopted by federal and state regulatory agencies. Under state law, a bank may not pay dividends unless, following the dividend payment, the capital stock of the bank would be unimpaired and either (a) the bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or, if not, (b) the payment of the dividend will not reduce the surplus of the bank. 

If, in the opinion of the FDIC, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), the FDIC may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice or, as a result of an unrelated practice, require the bank to limit dividends in the future. The Federal Reserve Board has similar authority with respect to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Regulatory pressures to reclassify and charge off loans and to establish additional loan loss reserves can have the effect of reducing current operating earnings and thus impacting an institution&#146;s ability to pay dividends. Further, as described herein, the regulatory authorities have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by a bank or bank holding company under their jurisdiction. Compliance with the standards set forth in these policy statements and guidelines could limit the amount of dividends which the Company and Lakeland may pay. Banking institutions that fail to maintain the minimum capital ratios, or that maintain the requisite minimum capital ratios but do so at a level below the minimum capital ratios plus the new capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends. See &#147;Capital Requirements&#148; below. 

Capital Requirements 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; or &#147;critically undercapitalized,&#148; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be &#147;well capitalized.&#148; The financial holding company of a bank will be put under directives to raise its capital levels or divest its activities if the depository institution falls from that level. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the &#147;Basel Rules&#148;). The Basel Rules implement the Basel Committee&#146;s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed below. The Basel Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank, compared to prior U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk- 

&#160; 

weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 Basel II capital accords. The Basel Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#146; rules. 

The Basel Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for certain components). 

For bank holding companies and banks like Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank, January 1, 2015 was the start date for compliance with the revised minimum regulatory capital ratios and for determining risk-weighted assets under what the Basel Rules call a &#147;standardized approach.&#148; As of January 1, 2015, Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank were required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% (this is a new concept and requirement, and is referred to as the &#147;CET1&#148;); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148;) of 6.0%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0%. 

In addition, Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank are subject to a leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements). 

The Basel Rules also require a &#147;capital conservation buffer.&#148; When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank will be required to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, in addition to the minimum capital ratios described above, effectively resulting in the following minimum capital ratios on January 1, 2019: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; CET1 of 7.0%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Total Capital Ratio of 10.5%. 

The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is needed most, allowing them to weather periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum capital ratios but below the minimum capital ratios plus the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level (thus effectively resulting in minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2016 for CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio of 5.125%, 6.625% and 8.625%, respectively), and increases by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The Basel Rules also adopted a &#147;countercyclical capital buffer,&#148; which is not applicable to Lakeland Bancorp or Lakeland Bank. That buffer is applicable only to &#147;advanced approaches banking organizations,&#148; which generally are those with consolidated total assets of at least $250 billion. 

The Basel Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which are being phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 

Under prior capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel Rules, the effects 

&#160; 

of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, banking organizations such as Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank made such an election to continue to exclude these items. 

While the Basel Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as Lakeland Bancorp, may permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. 

The Basel Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expands the risk-weighting categories from the previous four categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets. 

With respect to Lakeland Bank, the Basel Rules revise the &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; regulations under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status (a new standard); (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (increased from 6%); and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5% to be well-capitalized (increased from the previously required leverage ratio of 3% or 4%). The Basel Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; category. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the FDIC&#146;s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as &#147;well capitalized&#148; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and (v) does not meet the definition of &#147;well capitalized.&#148; An institution will be classified as &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under the Basel Rules will exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. 

As of December 31, 2015, Lakeland Bancorp and Lakeland Bank met all capital requirements under the Basel Rules as then in effect, and the Company believes that as of such date, it would meet all capital requirements under the Basel Rules on a fully phased-in basis, if the full phase-in of such requirements were currently in effect. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule 

In December 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and several other governmental regulatory agencies issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, generally to become effective on July 21, 2016. These rules generally became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from (i) engaging in &#147;proprietary trading&#148; and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (defined as &#147;Covered Funds&#148;) subject to certain limited exceptions. The Company does not own any interests in any hedge funds or private equity funds that are designated &#147;Covered Funds&#148; under the Volcker Rule. 

Federal Deposit Insurance and Premiums 

Lakeland&#146;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the basic federal deposit insurance limit was permanently increased to at least $250,000. 

In November 2010, the FDIC approved a rule to change the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. These new assessment rates began in the second quarter of 2011 and were paid at the end of September 2011. Since the new base is larger than the current base, the FDIC&#146;s rule lowered the total base assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The Company paid $2.0 million in total FDIC assessments in both 2015 and 2014. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (&#147;DRR&#148;), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset. 

In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC is required to continue to collect from institutions payments for the servicing of obligations of the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding. Lakeland paid a FICO premium of approximately $193,000 in 2015 and expects to pay a similar amount in 2016. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry as a result of significant regulatory and compliance changes, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. Generally, the Dodd-Frank Act became effective the day after it was signed into law, but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law. 

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Minimum Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new capital rules and the application of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. In addition to making bank holding companies subject to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries, these provisions (often referred to as the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act) were also intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of 

&#160; 

&#160; hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. See &#147;Capital Requirements&#148; for a description of new capital requirements adopted by U.S. federal banking regulators in 2013 and the treatment of trust preferred securities under such rules. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) are calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution&#146;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. In December 2010, the FDIC increased the designated reserve ratio to 2.0 percent. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Shareholder Votes . The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies like Lakeland Bancorp to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#147;golden parachute&#148; payments in certain circumstances. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#147;covered transactions&#148; and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. These requirements became effective during 2011. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#146;s board of directors. These requirements became effective during 2011. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enhanced Lending Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the previous limits on a depository institution&#146;s credit exposure to one borrower which limited a depository institution&#146;s ability to extend credit to one person (or group of related persons) in an amount exceeding certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Compensation Practices . The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other &#147;covered financial institution&#148; that provides an insider or other employee with &#147;excessive compensation&#148; or compensation that gives rise to excessive risk or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. In June 2010, prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the bank regulatory agencies promulgated the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies , which sets forth three key principles concerning incentive compensation arrangements: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; such arrangements should provide employees incentives that balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose the financial institution to imprudent risks; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; such arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; such arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance with effective and active oversight by the financial institution&#146;s board of directors. 

Together, the Dodd-Frank Act and guidance from the bank regulatory agencies on compensation may impact the Company&#146;s compensation practices. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;Bureau&#148;). The Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau within the Federal Reserve. The Bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the Bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau against state-chartered institutions. The Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; De Novo Banking . The Dodd-Frank Act allows de novo interstate branching by banks. 

Final rules have been issued which implement the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (QM) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#147;QM Rule&#148;). The QM Rule impacted our mortgage originations when it became effective in January 2014. The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of &#147;qualified mortgage&#148; are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a &#147;qualified mortgage&#148; incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43 percent debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA and VA underwriting and eligibility guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43 percent debt-to-income limits. We cannot assure you that existing or future regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our residential mortgage loan business or the housing markets in which we participate. 

In addition, provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act which have revised the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future. See &#147;Capital Requirements.&#148; 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Consequently, the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to continue to increase our cost of doing business, it may limit or expand our permissible activities, and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, remains very unpredictable at this time. 

Proposed Legislation 

From time to time proposals are made in the United States Congress, the New Jersey Legislature, and before various bank regulatory authorities, which would alter the powers of, and place restrictions on, different types of banking organizations. It is impossible to predict the impact, if any, of potential legislative trends on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

In accordance with federal law providing for deregulation of interest on all deposits, banks and thrift organizations are now unrestricted by law or regulation from paying interest at any rate on most time deposits. It is not clear whether deregulation and other pending changes in certain aspects of the banking industry will result in further increases in the cost of funds in relation to prevailing lending rates.
