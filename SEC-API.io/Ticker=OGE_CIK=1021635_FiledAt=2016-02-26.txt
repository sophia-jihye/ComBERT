 Item 1. Business. 

THE COMPANY 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

The Company is an energy and energy services provider offering physical delivery and related services for both electricity and natural gas primarily in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. The accounts of the Company &#32;and its wholly owned subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. T he Company &#32;generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments where its ownership interest is between 20 percent and 50 percent and has the ability to exercise significant influence. The Company was incorporated in August 1995 in the state of Oklahoma and its principal executive offices are located at &#32; 321 North Harvey , P.O. Box 321 , Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73101-0321 ; telephone &#32; 405-553-3000 . 

&#160; 

The electric utility segment &#32; generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas . Its operations &#32; are conducted through OG&#38;E &#32; and &#32; are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. &#160; OG&#38;E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory &#32; and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. &#32; OG&#38;E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&#38;E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. &#32; 

The natural gas midstream operations segment currently represents the Company's investment in Enable through its wholly owned subsidiary OGE Holdings. Enable is engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas. Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are strategically located in four states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in the Bakken shale formation, principally located in the Williston basin of North Dakota. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois. For periods prior to the formation of Enable, the natural gas midstream operations segment reflected the consolidated results of Enogex Holdings. &#32; 

Enable was formed effective May 1, 2013 &#32; by the Company, the ArcLight group and CenterPoint to own and operate the midstream businesses of the Company and CenterPoint. In the formation transaction, the Company and the ArcLight group contributed Enogex LLC to Enable and &#32; the Company deconsolidated its previously held investment in Enogex Holdings and acquired an equity interest in Enable. &#32;&#32; The Company's contribution of Enogex LLC to Enable met the requirements of being in substance real estate and was recorded at historical cost. &#32;&#32; The general partner of Enable is equally controlled by CenterPoint and OGE Energy, who each have &#32; 50 percent &#32; management ownership. &#32; Based on the 50/50 management ownership, with neither company having control , effective May 1, 2013, the Company &#32; began accounting for its interest in Enable using the equity method of accounting. &#32; 

In April 2014, Enable completed an initial public offering of &#32; 25,000,000 &#32; common units resulting in Enable becoming a publicly traded Master Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2015 , the Company owned approximately 111.0 million &#32;limited partner units, or 26.3 percent , of which 68.2 million &#32;limited partner units were subordinated. 

&#160; 

On January 22, 2016, Enable announced a quarterly dividend distribution of &#32; $0.31800 &#32; per unit on its outstanding common and subordinated units, which is unchanged from the previous quarter. &#32;&#32; Based on current commodity prices, Enable has seen changes in producer activity that have negatively impacted Enable's operations and financial position and could see additional changes in producer activity that may negatively impact Enable's operations and affect its future distribution rates. &#32;&#32; If cash distributions to Enable&#8217;s unitholders exceed &#32; $0.330625 &#32; per unit in any quarter, the general partner will receive increasing percentages, up to &#32; 50 percent , of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. OGE Holdings is entitled to &#32; 60 percent &#32; of those &#8220;incentive distributions.&#8221; 

Company Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company's &#32; mission, through OG&#38;E and its equity interest in Enable, is to fulfill its critical role in the nation's electric utility and natural gas midstream pipeline infrastructure and meet individual customers' needs for energy and related services 

&#32;2 

focusing on safety, efficiency, reliability, customer service and risk management. &#32;&#32; The Company's &#32; corporate strategy is to continue to maintain its existing business mix and diversified asset position of its regulated electric utility business and interest in a publicly traded midstream company, while providing competitive energy products and services to customers, as well as seeking growth opportunities in both businesses. &#160; 

OG&#38;E is focused on: &#32; 

&#8226; 

Providing exceptional customer experiences by continuing to improve customer interfaces, tools, products and services that deliver high customer satisfaction and operating productivity. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers we serve. A particular focus is on enhancing the value of the grid by improving distribution grid reliability by reducing the frequency and duration of customer interruptions and leveraging previous grid technology investments. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships for the long-term benefit of our customers, investors and members. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Continuing to grow a zero-injury culture and deliver top-quartile safety results. 

&#8226; 

Complying with the EPA's MATS and Regional Haze requirements. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Ensuring we have the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term needs of our customers. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Continuing focus on operational excellence and efficiencies in order to protect the customer bill. 

Additionally, the Company wants to achieve a premium valuation of its businesses relative to its peers, grow earnings per share with a stable earnings pattern, create a high performance culture and achieve desired outcomes with target stakeholders. The Company's financial objectives include a long-term annual earnings growth rate for OG&#38;E of three to five percent on a weather-normalized basis, maintaining a strong credit rating as well as targeting &#32; dividend increases of approximately 10 percent annually through 2019. &#32;&#32; The targeted annual dividend increase has been determined after consideration of numerous factors, including the largely retail composition of the Company's shareholder base, the Company's financial position, the Company's growth targets and the composition of the Company's assets and investment opportunities. &#160; The Company also relies on cash distributions from its investment in Enable to fund its capital needs and support future dividend growth. The Company believes it can accomplish these financial objectives by, among other things, pursuing multiple avenues to build its business, maintaining a diversified asset position, continuing to develop a wide range of skills to succeed with changes in its industries, providing products and services to customers efficiently, managing risks effectively and maintaining strong regulatory and legislative relationships. 

&#160; 

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS - OG&#38;E 

General 

The electric utility segment &#32; generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas . Its operations &#32; are conducted through OG&#38;E . OG&#38;E furnishes retail electric service in &#32; 267 &#32; communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas. &#32;&#32;The service area covers 30,000 &#32; square miles in Oklahoma and western Arkansas, including Oklahoma City, the largest city in Oklahoma, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, the second largest city in that state. &#32;&#32; Of the &#32; 267 &#32; communities that OG&#38;E serves, &#32; 241 &#32; are located in Oklahoma and &#32; 26 &#32; are in Arkansas. &#32; OG&#38;E derived &#32; 91 percent &#32; of its total electric operating revenues in &#32; 2015 &#32; from sales in Oklahoma and the remainder from sales in Arkansas. As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , OG&#38;E no longer serves wholesale customers in either state. &#32; 

OG&#38;E's system control area peak demand in &#32; 2015 &#32; was &#32; 6,537 &#32; MWs on &#32; August 7, 2015 . OG&#38;E's load responsibility peak demand was &#32; 5,998 &#32; MWs on &#32; August 7, 2015 . &#32;&#32;As reflected in the table below and in the operating statistics that follow, there were &#32; 27.2 million &#32; MWh system sales in &#32; 2015 , 28.0 million &#32; MWh system sales in &#32; 2014 &#32; and &#32; 28.2 million &#32; MWh system sales in &#32; 2013 . Variations in system sales for the three years are reflected in the following table:

OG&#38;E is subject to competition in various degrees from government-owned electric systems, municipally-owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from other private utilities, power marketers and cogenerators as well as from consumers choosing appliances powered by other energy sources. Oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity. 

&#32;3 

Besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity, OG&#38;E competes with suppliers of other forms of energy. The degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy. It is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production. Our ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinate of our competitiveness. &#32;

Regulation and Rates 

OG&#38;E's retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas. The issuance of certain securities by OG&#38;E is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC. OG&#38;E's wholesale electric tariffs, transmission activities, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OG&#38;E's facilities and operations. &#160; In &#32; 2015 , 86 percent &#32; of OG&#38;E's electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, &#32; eight percent &#32; to the APSC and &#32; six percent &#32; to the FERC. 

The OCC issued an order in 1996 authorizing OG&#38;E to reorganize into a subsidiary of &#32;the Company. The order required that, among other things, (i) the Company permit the OCC access to the books and records of &#32; the Company and its affiliates relating to transactions with OG&#38;E, (ii) the Company &#32;employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OG&#38;E's customers and (iii) the Company refrain from pledging OG&#38;E assets or income for affiliate transactions. In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 enacted the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which in turn granted to the FERC access to the books and records of &#32;the Company &#32;and its affiliates as the FERC deems relevant to costs incurred by OG&#38;E or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates . 

Completed Regulatory Matters 

Fuel Adjustment Clause Review for Calendar Year 2013 &#32; 

The OCC routinely reviews the costs recovered from customers through OG&#38;E's fuel adjustment clause. On July 31, 2014, the OCC Staff filed an application to review OG&#38;E's fuel adjustment clause for calendar year 2013, including the prudence of OG&#38;E's electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement costs. On May 21, 2015, the ALJ recommended that the OCC find that OG&#38;E's 2013 electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement processes and costs were prudent, accurate and properly applied to customer billing statements. OG&#38;E received an order to that effect from the OCC on June 17, 2015. &#32; 

Oklahoma Demand Program Rider 

On January 6, 2016, the OCC approved &#32;OG&#38;E's 2016 through 2018 demand portfolio programs. The order stipulates recovery of program costs, lost revenues and incentives resulting from those programs, through the Demand Program Rider. 

Pending Regulatory Matters 

Set forth below is a list of various proceedings pending before state or federal regulatory agencies. Unless stated otherwise, OG&#38;E cannot predict when the regulatory agency will act or what action the regulatory agency will take. OG&#38;E's financial results are dependent in part on timely and adequate decisions by the regulatory agencies that set OG&#38;E's rates. 

FERC Order No. 1000, Final Rule on Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation &#32; 

On July 21, 2011, the FERC issued Order No. 1000, which revised the FERC's existing regulations governing the process for planning enhancements and expansions of the electric transmission grid along with the corresponding process for allocating the costs of such expansions. Order No. 1000 requires individual regions to determine whether a previously-approved project is subject to reevaluation and is therefore governed by the new rule. &#32; 

&#32; Order No. 1000 directs public utility transmission providers to remove from the FERC-jurisdictional tariff and agreement provisions that establish any Federal "right of first refusal" for the incumbent transmission owner (such as OG&#38;E) regarding transmission facilities selected in a regional transmission planning process, subject to certain limitations. However, Order No. 1000 is not intended to affect the right of an incumbent transmission owner (such as OG&#38;E) to build, own and recover costs for upgrades to its own transmission facilities or to alter an incumbent transmission owner's use and control of existing rights of way. Order No. 1000 also clarifies that incumbent transmission owners may rely on regional transmission facilities to meet their reliability needs or service obligations. The SPP's pre-Order No. 1000 tariff included a "right of first refusal" for incumbent transmission owners and this provision has played a role in OG&#38;E being selected by the SPP to build previous transmission projects in Oklahoma. On May 29, 2013, the Governor of Oklahoma signed House Bill 1932 into law which establishes a right of first refusal for Oklahoma incumbent transmission owners, including OG&#38;E, to build new transmission projects with voltages under 300 kV that interconnect to those incumbent owners' existing facilities. &#32; 

The SPP has submitted compliance filings implementing Order No. 1000's requirements. In response, the FERC issued an order on the SPP filings that required the SPP to remove certain right of first refusal language from the SPP Tariff and the SPP Membership Agreement. On December 15, 2014, OG&#38;E filed an appeal in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging 

&#32;5 

the FERC's order requiring the removal of the right of first refusal language from the SPP Membership Agreement. The court has not yet acted on OG&#38;E's appeal. 

Oklahoma Demand Program Rider Review - SmartHours Program &#32;&#32; 

In July 2012, OG&#38;E filed an application with the OCC to recover certain costs associated with Demand Programs through the Demand Program Rider, including the lost revenues associated with the SmartHours program. The SmartHours program is designed to incentivize participating customers to reduce on-peak usage or shift usage to off-peak hours during the months of May through October, by offering lower rates to those customers in the off-peak hours of those months. Lost revenues are created by the difference in the standard rates and the lower incentivized rates. Non-SmartHours program customers benefit from the reduction of on-peak usage by SmartHours customers by the reduction of more costly on-peak generation and the delay in adding new on-peak generation. &#32;&#32; 

In December 2012, the OCC issued an order approving the recovery of costs associated with the Demand Programs, including the lost revenues associated with the SmartHours program, subject to the Oklahoma PUD staff review. &#32;&#32; 

In March 2014, the Oklahoma PUD staff began their review of the Demand Program cost, including the lost revenues associated with the SmartHours program. In November 2014, OG&#38;E believed that it had reached an agreement with the Oklahoma PUD staff on the methodology to be used to calculate lost revenues associated with the SmartHours program and the amount of lost revenue for 2013, which totaled $10.1 million . The agreement also included utilizing the same methodology for calculating lost revenues for 2014, which resulted in lost revenues for 2014 of &#32; $11.6 million . 

In January 2015, OG&#38;E implemented rates that began recovering the 2013 lost revenues, in accordance with the agreement that it believed had been reached with the Oklahoma PUD staff. &#32;&#32; 

In April 2015, the Oklahoma PUD staff filed an application, seeking an order from the OCC, for determining the proper methodology for calculating lost revenues pursuant to OG&#38;E&#8217;s Demand Program Rider, primarily affecting the SmartHours program lost revenues. In the application, the Oklahoma PUD staff recommends the OCC approve the Oklahoma PUD staff methodology for calculating lost revenues associated with the SmartHours program, which differs from the methodology that OG&#38;E believes it agreed upon and which would result in recovery of lost revenue for 2013 of $4.9 million , a reduction of &#32; $5.2 million &#32; from the amount recorded by OG&#38;E for 2013. &#32; 

OG&#38;E believes the methodology agreed to in November 2014 is consistent with the 2012 OCC order and it is probable that OG&#38;E will recover the $10.1 million &#32; of lost revenues associated with 2013, the &#32; $11.6 million &#32;associated with 2014 and the $14.9 million &#32; associated with 2015. A hearing was held on June 30, 2015 and July 1, 2015. OG&#38;E is unable to predict when it will receive a ruling from the OCC. &#32; 

Environmental Compliance Plan &#32; 

On August 6, 2014, OG&#38;E filed an application with the OCC for approval of its plan to comply with the EPA&#8217;s MATS and Regional Haze FIP while serving the best long-term interests of customers in light of future environmental uncertainties. The application sought approval of the ECP and for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. The ECP includes installing dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas. The application also asks the OCC to predetermine the prudence of its Mustang Modernization Plan which calls for replacing OG&#38;E's soon-to-be retired Mustang steam turbines in late 2017 with 400 MWs of new, efficient combustion turbines at the Mustang site in 2018 and 2019 and approval for a recovery mechanism for the associated costs. OG&#38;E estimates the total capital cost associated with its environmental compliance plan to be approximately &#32; $1.1 billion . The OCC hearing on OG&#38;E's application before an ALJ began on March 3, 2015 and concluded on April 8, 2015. Multiple parties advocating a variety of positions intervened in the proceeding. &#32; 

On June 8, 2015, the ALJ issued his report on OG&#38;E's application. While the ALJ in his report agreed that the installation of dry scrubbers at Sooner Units 1 and 2 and the conversion of Muskogee Units 4 and 5 to natural gas pursuant to OG&#38;E&#8217;s ECP is the best approach, the ALJ's report included several recommendations. OG&#38;E filed exceptions to the ALJ's report and on July 21, 2015, Commissioner Bob Anthony issued his deliberation statement that was consistent with many parts of the ALJ's report, including the ALJ&#8217;s support of OG&#38;E&#8217;s ECP, the ALJ&#8217;s recommendation to pre-approve certain estimated costs of the environmental recovery plan, and the ALJ&#8217;s recommendation to defer all other cost recovery issues until the next general rate case. &#32; 

On December 2, 2015, OG&#38;E received an order from the OCC denying, by a two to one vote, its plan to comply with the environmental mandates of the Federal Clean Air Act, Regional Haze and MATS. The OCC also denied OG&#38;E's request for pre-approval of its Mustang Modernization Plan, revised depreciation rates for both the retirement of the Mustang units and the 

&#32;6 

replacement combustion turbines and pre-approval of early retirement and replacement of generating units at its Mustang site, including cost recovery through a rider. &#32; 

On December 11, 2015, OG&#38;E filed a motion requesting modification of the OCC order for the purposes of approving only the ECP. OG&#38;E did not seek modification to any other provisions of the OCC order, including cost recovery. OG&#38;E also agreed that it would not implement a rider for recovery of the costs of the ECP until and unless authorized by the OCC in a subsequent proceeding. &#32;&#32; On December 23, 2015, the OCC rejected, by a two to one vote, a proposal by Commissioner Dana Murphy to grant OG&#38;E's December 11, 2015 motion. 

On February 12, 2016, OG&#38;E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&#38;E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&#38;E had incurred &#32; $94.8 million &#32; of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&#38;E estimates another &#32; $35.0 million &#32; of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&#38;E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. &#32; 

&#160; 

Fuel Adjustment Clause Review for Calendar Year 2014 &#32; 

On July 28, 2015, the OCC staff filed an application to review OG&#38;E's fuel adjustment clause for calendar year 2014, including the prudence of OG&#38;E's electric generation, purchased power and fuel procurement costs. OG&#38;E filed the necessary information and documents needed to satisfy the OCC's minimum filing requirement rules on September 2, 2015. A hearing is scheduled to be held on April 7, 2016. &#32; 

Integrated Resource Plans &#32; 

In August 2015, OG&#38;E initiated the process to update its IRP pursuant to the OCC rules. After engaging interested stakeholders in August and September, OG&#38;E finalized the 2015 IRP and submitted it to the OCC on October 1, 2015. The 2015 IRP updated certain assumptions contained in the IRP submitted in 2014, but did not make any material changes to the ECP and other parts of the action plan contained in the IRP submitted in 2014. &#32; 

Oklahoma Rate Case Filing &#32; 

On December 18, 2015, OG&#38;E filed a general rate case with the OCC requesting a rate increase of &#32; $92.5 million &#32; and a &#32; 10.25 percent &#32; return on equity based on a June 30, 2015 test year. OG&#38;E primarily seeks to recover &#32; $1.6 billion &#32; of electric infrastructure additions since its last general rate case in Oklahoma, the impact of the expiration of OG&#38;E's wholesale contracts and increased operating costs such as vegetation management. &#32;&#32; 

Arkansas Rate Case Filing &#32; 

OG&#38;E intends to file a general rate case with the APSC by August 15, 2016. &#32; 

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 

OG&#38;E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. 

OG&#38;E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. 

At &#32; December 31, 2015 &#32; and &#32; 2014 , OG&#38;E had regulatory assets of &#32; $448.7 million &#32; and &#32; $508.6 million , respectively, and regulatory liabilities of &#32; $341.4 million &#32; and &#32; $287.4 million , respectively. &#32;&#32; See Note 1 of Notes to &#32;Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion. 

&#32;7 

Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. &#160; When in management's judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is adjusted, as appropriate. &#160; If &#32; OG&#38;E &#32; were required to discontinue the application of accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets, which could have significant financial effects. &#32; 

Rate Structures &#32; 

Oklahoma &#32; 

OG&#38;E's standard tariff rates include a cost-of-service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus a fuel adjustment clause mechanism that allows OG&#38;E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. 

OG&#38;E offers several alternate customer programs and rate options. Under OG&#38;E's Smart Grid enabled SmartHours programs, "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" rates offer customers the ability to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to times when demand for electricity and costs are at their lowest. The guaranteed flat bill option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set monthly price for an entire year. A second tariff rate option provides a "renewable energy" resource to OG&#38;E's Oklahoma retail customers. This renewable energy resource is a Renewable Energy Credit purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&#38;E's Oklahoma retail customers. OG&#38;E's ownership and access to wind resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers. Another program being offered to OG&#38;E's commercial and industrial customers is a voluntary load curtailment program called Load Reduction. This program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis when OG&#38;E's system conditions merit curtailment action. Customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response. This voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days, but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required. OG&#38;E also offers certain qualifying customers "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on price signals received from OG&#38;E. The prices for the "day-ahead price" and "flex price" rate options are based on OG&#38;E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 

OG&#38;E also has the Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools Non-Demand rate classes that provide OG&#38;E with flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns. OG&#38;E also provides service level, seasonal and time period fuel charge differentiation that allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect the underlying costs of providing electric service. Lastly, OG&#38;E has a military base rider that demonstrates Oklahoma's continued commitment to our military partners. &#32;&#32; 

The previously discussed rate options, coupled with OG&#38;E's other rate choices, provide many tariff options for OG&#38;E's Oklahoma retail customers. The revenue impacts associated with these options are not determinable in future years because customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the alternative rate option choices. Revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers' usage characteristics if they choose alternative rate options. 

Arkansas &#32; 

OG&#38;E's standard tariff rates include a cost-of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus an energy cost recovery mechanism that allows OG&#38;E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. OG&#38;E offers several alternate customer programs and rate options. The "time-of-use" and "variable peak pricing" tariffs allow participating customers to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to times when demand for electricity is lowest. A second tariff rate option provides a "renewable energy" resource to OG&#38;E's Arkansas retail customers. This renewable energy resource is a Renewable Energy Credit purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of OG&#38;E's Arkansas retail customers. OG&#38;E's ownership and access to wind resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation-minded customers. OG&#38;E offers its commercial and industrial customers a voluntary load curtailment program called Load Reduction. This program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis and receive a billing credit when OG&#38;E's system conditions merit curtailment action. OG&#38;E offers certain qualifying customers a "day-ahead price" rate option which allows participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on a price signal received from OG&#38;E. The day-ahead price is based on OG&#38;E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 

Fuel Supply and Generation &#32; 

In &#32; 2015 , 49.0 percent &#32; of the OG&#38;E-generated energy was produced by coal-fired units, &#32; 44.0 percent &#32; by natural gas-fired units and &#32; seven percent &#32; by wind-powered units. &#32;&#32; Of OG&#38;E's &#32; 6,771 &#32; total MWs of generation capability reflected in the table under 

&#32;8 

Item 2. Properties, &#32; 3,770 &#32; MWs, or &#32; 55.7 percent , are from natural gas generation, &#32; 2,552 &#32; MWs, or &#32; 37.7 percent , are from coal generation and &#32; 449 &#32; MWs, or &#32; 6.6 percent , are from wind generation. Over the last five years, the weighted average cost of fuel used, by type, was as follows:

The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to less natural gas used, offset by higher natural gas prices. The increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to higher gas prices. The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. These fuel costs are recovered through OG&#38;E's fuel adjustment clauses that are approved by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. 

OG&#38;E began participating in the SPP Integrated Marketplace effective March 1, 2014. The SPP Integrated Marketplace replaced the SPP Energy Imbalance Services market. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP assumed balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&#38;E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations, and determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. As a result, OG&#38;E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&#38;E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses. 

Coal 

OG&#38;E's coal-fired units, with an aggregate capability of &#32; 2,552 &#32; MWs, are designed to burn low sulfur western sub-bituminous coal. &#32; The combination of all coal has a weighted average sulfur content of 0.23 percent . Based on the average sulfur content and EPA-certified data, OG&#38;E's coal units have an approximate emission rate of 0.5 &#32; lbs of SO 2 &#32;per MMBtu. &#32;&#32; 

OG&#38;E has acquired 100 percent of its forecasted annual coal usage via existing inventory and purchase contracts that expire in December &#32; 2016 &#32; and December &#32; 2017 . In &#32; 2015 , OG&#38;E purchased 7.7 million &#32; tons of coal from various Wyoming suppliers. &#32;&#32;See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Laws and Regulations" for a discussion of environmental matters which may affect OG&#38;E in the future, including its utilization of coal, 

Natural Gas 

As a participant in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, OG&#38;E now purchases a relatively small percentage of its natural gas supply through long-term agreements. Alternatively, OG&#38;E relies on a combination of call natural gas agreements, whereby OG&#38;E has the right but not the obligation to purchase a defined quantity of natural gas, combined with day and intra-day purchases to meet the demands of the SPP Integrated Marketplace. 

Wind 

OG&#38;E's current wind power portfolio includes the following, in addition to the 120 MW Centennial, 101 MW OU Spirit and 228 MW Crossroads wind farms owned by OG&#38;E: &#32; (i) access to up to &#32; 50 &#32; MWs of electricity generated at a wind farm near Woodward, Oklahoma from a 15-year contract OG&#38;E entered into with FPL Energy that expires in 2018, (ii) access to up to &#32; 152 &#32; MWs of electricity generated at a wind farm in Woodward County, Oklahoma from a 20-year contract OG&#38;E entered into with CPV Keenan that expires in 2031, (iii) access to up to &#32; 130 &#32; MWs of electricity generated at a wind farm in Dewey County, Oklahoma from a 20-year contract OG&#38;E entered into with Edison Mission Energy that expires in 2031 and (iv) access to up to &#32; 60 &#32; MWs of electricity generated at a wind farm near Blackwell, Oklahoma from a 20-year contract OG&#38;E entered into with NextEra Energy that expires in 2032. &#32; 

Safety and Health Regulation 

&#160; 

OG&#38;E is subject to a number of Federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, the EPA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers. 

&#32;9 

In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials stored, used or produced in OG&#38;E's operations and that this information be provided or made available to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. OG&#38;E believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health. &#32; 

NATURAL GAS MIDSTREAM OPERATIONS - ENABLE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS 

Overview 

&#160; 

Enable is a large-scale, growth-oriented publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed to own, operate and develop strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets. Enable serves current and emerging production areas in the United States, including several unconventional shale resource plays and local and regional end-user markets in the United States. Enable's assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, which primarily provides natural gas gathering, processing and fractionation services and crude oil gathering for its producer customers and (ii) Transportation and Storage, which provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to natural gas producers, utilities and industrial customers. 

Enable's natural gas gathering and processing assets are located in five states and serve natural gas production from shale developments in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business in North Dakota's Bakken Shale formation of the Williston Basin that commenced initial operations in November 2013. Enable's natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois. 

Enable was formed on May 1, 2013, to own and operate the midstream businesses of OGE Energy and CenterPoint. As of December 31, 2015 , Enable's portfolio of energy infrastructure assets included approximately 12,400 &#32;miles of gathering pipelines, 13 &#32;major processing plants with approximately 2.3 &#32;Bcf/d of processing capacity, approximately 7,900 &#32;miles of interstate pipelines (including SESH), approximately 2,200 &#32;miles of intrastate pipelines and eight &#32;natural gas storage facilities providing approximately 85.0 &#32;Bcf of storage capacity. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 81 percent of Enable's gross margin was generated from contracts that are fee-based, and approximately 56 percent of its gross margin was attributable to fees associated with firm contracts or contracts with minimum volume commitment features. 

The following table shows the components of Enable's gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 .

Gathering and Processing 

Enable owns and operates approximately 12,400 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins with approximately 976,000 horsepower of compression and 13 natural gas processing plants with approximately 2.3 Bcf/d of processing capacity and 2.3 Bcf/d of treating capacity as of December 31, 2015. Enable provides gathering, compression, treating, dehydration, processing and NGL fractionation for producers who are active in the areas in which it operates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, its assets gathered an average of approximately 3.14 TBtu/d of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Enable processed approximately 1.78 TBtu/d of natural gas and produced approximately 73.55 MBbl/d of NGLs. 

&#32;10 

As of December 31, 2015, Enable&#8217;s processing infrastructure consisted of 13 plants located in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex basins. The assets serving the Anadarko basin consist of ten processing plants, eight of which are interconnected through its super-header system, and are configured to facilitate the flow of natural gas from western Oklahoma and the Wheeler County area in the Texas Panhandle to the Bradley, Cox City, Thomas, McClure, Calumet, Clinton, South Canadian and Wheeler processing plants. Enable is also constructing two additional cryogenic processing facilities to connect to its super-header system in Grady County, Oklahoma and Garvin County, Oklahoma, which are expected to add 400 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity. The first of the two new plants (the Bradley 2 Plant) is a 200 MMcf/d plant which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. The second plant (the Wildhorse Plant) is a 200 MMcf/d plant that is expected to be completed in late 2017. &#32;&#32;Enable&#8217;s super-header system is intended to allow it to optimize the economics of its natural gas processing and to improve system utilization and reliability. The Wetumka Plant in the Arkoma basin serves the rich gas western portion of the area. The Sligo and Waskom plants in the Ark-La-Tex basin serve the Haynesville, Cotton Valley and Lower Bossier plays.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, Enable generated 72.0 percent of its gathering and processing gross margin from gathering and processing fees. The remaining 28.0 percent of gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 came from commodities, including natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate received under percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-liquids and keep-whole arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2015, contracts generating 34.0 percent of gathering and processing gross margin had minimum volume commitments and guaranteed return features with remaining terms ranging from two to 12 years. Under a minimum volume commitment, a customer commits to ship a minimum volume of natural gas over a period of time on Enable's gathering system, or, in lieu of shipping such volumes, to pay as if that minimum amount had been shipped. 

As of December 31, 2015, Enable&#8217;s gathering agreements had acreage dedications with original terms ranging up to 15 years, which generally require that production by customers within the acreage dedication be delivered to Enable&#8217;s gathering system. As of December 31, 2015, Enable's natural gas gathering agreements had acreage dedications of 6.7 million gross acres with a volume-weighted average remaining term of approximately seven years. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Enable had minimum volume commitments in lean natural gas developments of 2.1 Bcf/d with a weighted average remaining term of over six years. 

Transportation and Storage 

Enable provides fee-based interstate and intrastate transportation and storage services across nine states. Enable owns and operates approximately 7,900 miles (including SESH) of interstate transportation pipelines with average firm contracted capacity of 7.19 Bcf/d (excluding SESH), for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, Enable owns and operates approximately 2,200 miles of intrastate transportation pipelines with average aggregate throughput of 1.84 TBtu/d for the year ended December 31, 2015. Enable also owns and operates eight &#32;natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Illinois with approximately 85.0 &#32;Bcf of aggregate storage capacity.

Actual volumes transported per day may be less than total firm contracted capacity based on demand. 

(C) 

This represents the maximum single day receipts on the intrastate systems. Enable's Oklahoma intrastate pipeline system is a web-like configuration with multi-directional flow capabilities between numerous receipt and delivery points, which limits the ability to determine an overall system capacity. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the peak daily throughput was 2.1 TBtu or, on a volumetric basis, 2.1 &#32;Bcf/d. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The activities of &#32;the Company are subject to numerous stringent and complex Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact OG&#38;E's business activities in many ways including the handling or disposal of waste material, future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. OG&#38;E believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards. &#32;&#32;&#32; 

&#160; 

The trend in environmental regulation, however, is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. &#32;&#32;The Company cannot assure that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause it to incur significant costs. Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market. &#160; 

It is estimated that OG&#38;E's &#32; total expenditures to comply with environmental laws, regulations and requirements for &#32; 2016 &#32; will be &#32; $195.9 million , of which &#32; $178.3 million &#32; is for capital expenditures. &#160; It is estimated that OG&#38;E's &#32; total expenditures to comply with environmental la ws, regulations and requirements for &#32; 2017 &#32; will be approximately &#32; $166.7 million &#32; of which &#32; $148.7 million &#32; is for capital expenditures. &#32;&#32; The amounts &#32; for OG&#38;E &#32; above include capital expenditures for low NO X &#32;burners and dry scrubbers. &#32; The Company's &#32; management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with current Federal, state and local environmental standards. &#32;&#32; Management continues to evaluate its compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market. &#32; 

For a further discussion of environmental matters that may affect &#32;the Company, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Environmental Laws and Regulations."

FINANCE AND CONSTRUCTION &#32; 

Future Capital Requirements and Financing Activities 

Capital Requirements 

The Company's &#32; primary needs for capital are related to acquiring or constructing new facilities and replacing or expanding existing facilities &#32; at OG&#38;E. &#160; Other working capital requirements are expected to be primarily related to maturing debt, operating lease obligations, fuel clause under and over recoveries and other general corporate purposes. &#160; The Company &#32; generally meets its cash needs through a combination of cash generated from operations, short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings &#32; and &#32; commercial paper ) and permanent financings. &#32;&#32; See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of &#32;the Company's capital requirements. 

Capital Expenditures 

&#160; 

The Company's consolidated &#32; estimates of capital expenditures for the years &#32; 2016 &#32; through &#32; 2020 &#32; are shown in the following table. &#160; These capital expenditures represent the base maintenance capital expenditures (i.e., capital expenditures to maintain and operate &#32; the Company's businesses) &#32; plus capital expenditures for known and committed projects. &#32;&#32; Estimated capital expenditures for Enable are not included in the table below.

Represent capital costs associated with OG&#38;E&#8217;s ECP to comply with the EPA&#8217;s MATS and Regional Haze rules. More detailed discussion regarding Regional Haze and OG&#38;E&#8217;s ECP can be found in Note &#32;15 of Notes to Financial Statements under "Environmental Compliance Plan" in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, and under &#8220;Environmental Laws and Regulations&#8221; within &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. &#32; On February 12, 2016, OG&#38;E filed an application requesting the OCC to issue an order approving the installation of dry scrubbers at the Sooner facility, on or before May 2, 2016. The application states that if the application is not approved by May 2, 2016, OG&#38;E will decide at that time whether to cancel the dry scrubber equipment and installation contracts and make plans to convert the Sooner coal units to natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, OG&#38;E had incurred &#32; $94.8 million &#32; of construction work in progress on the dry scrubbers. OG&#38;E estimates another &#32; $35.0 million &#32; of in-process expenditures will be incurred prior to May 1, 2016. Additionally, if the request is not approved, OG&#38;E expects to seek recovery in subsequent proceedings for the expenditures incurred for the dry scrubber project and reasonable stranded costs associated with the discontinuance of the Sooner coal units. &#32; The capital costs in the table above do not reflect any actions or costs that may be incurred (including the conversion of the Sooner coal units) if the May 2, 2016 application is not approved. &#32; 

Additional capital expenditures beyond those identified in the table above, including additional incremental growth opportunities in electric transmission assets &#32; will be evaluated based upon their impact upon achieving &#32; the Company's &#32; financial objectives. &#160; 

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans 

During 2015 and 2014, OGE Energy did not make any contributions to its Pension Plan. &#32;&#32;The Company &#32;has not determined whether it will need to make any contributions to the Pension Plan in 2016. &#32;&#32; See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Future Capital Requirements and Financing Activities" for a discussion of OGE Energy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. 

Common Stock Dividends 

At the Company's September 2015 board meeting, the Board of Directors approved management's recommendation of a 10 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to &#32; $0.27500 &#32; per share from &#32; $0.25000 &#32; per share effective in October 2015. &#32;See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Future Capital Requirements and Financing Activities" for a further discussion. 

Future Sources of Financing &#32; 

Management expects that cash generated from operations, proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt , proceeds from &#32; offerings &#32; and distributions from Enable &#32; will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs and to fund future growth opportunities. &#160; The Company &#32; utilizes short-term borrowings (through a combination of bank borrowings &#32; and &#32; commercial paper ) &#32; to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged. 

Short-Term Debt and Credit Facilities 

Short-term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements. The Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper and by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement. &#160; The Company has revolving credit facilities totaling in the aggregate &#32; $1,150.0 million . These &#32; bank &#32; facilities &#32; can also be used as &#32; letter of credit &#32;

facilities . As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , the Company had no short-term debt compared to &#32; a balance of $98.0 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . The average balance of short-term debt in &#32; 2015 &#32; was &#32; $75.2 million &#32; at a weighted-average interest rate of &#32; 0.46 percent . The maximum month-end balance of short-term debt in &#32; 2015 &#32; was &#32; $180.0 million . At &#32; December 31, 2015 , the Company had &#32; $1,148.1 million &#32; of net available liquidity under its revolving credit agreements. &#160; OG&#38;E has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up to &#32; $800.0 million &#32; in short-term borrowings at any one time for a two-year period beginning January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2016. &#160; At &#32; December 31, 2015 , the Company had &#32; $75.2 million &#32; in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's short-term debt activity. 

In December 2011, &#32; the Company and &#32; OG&#38;E entered into &#32; unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement s to total in the aggregate &#32; $1,150.0 million &#32;( $750.0 million &#32; for the Company and &#32; $400.0 million &#32; for OG&#38;E ). Each of the &#32; credit facilit ies &#32; contained &#32; an option, which could be exercised up to two times, to extend the term for an additional year. In the third quarter of 2013, &#32; the Company and &#32; OG&#38;E utilized one of these one-year extensions, and received consent from all of the lenders, to extend the maturity of &#32; their &#32; credit agreement s &#32; from December 13, 2016 to December 13, 2017. &#32; In the second quarter of 2014, &#32; the Company and &#32; OG&#38;E utilized &#32;their second extension to extend the maturity of &#32;their respective &#32; credit facility from December 13, 2017 to December 13, 2018. As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , commitments of approximately &#32; $16.3 million &#32;and $8.7 million &#32;of the Company's and OG&#38;E's credit facilities, respectively, however, were not extended and, unless the non-extending lender is replaced in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, &#32;such commitments will expire December 13, 2017 .
