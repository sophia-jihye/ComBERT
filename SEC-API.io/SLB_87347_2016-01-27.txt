 Item 1. Business. 

All references in this report to &#8220;Registrant,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Schlumberger,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in Cura&#231;ao) and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the world&#8217;s leading supplier of technology, integrated project management and information solutions to the international oil and gas exploration and production industry. Having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells, Schlumberger today provides the industry&#8217;s widest range of products and services from exploration through production. As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed approximately 95,000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in approximately 85 countries. Schlumberger has principal executive offices in Paris, Houston, London and The Hague. 

On August 26, 2015, Schlumberger and Cameron International Corporations (Cameron) jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement in which Cameron will merge with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, Cameron shareholders will receive 0.716 shares of Schlumberger common stock and a cash payment of $14.44 in exchange for each Cameron share of common stock outstanding. Schlumberger estimates that it will issue approximately 137 million shares of its common stock and pay cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction. In November 2015, the US Department of Justice cleared the proposed merger without any conditions. On December 17, 2015, Cameron stockholders voted to adopt the proposed merger. However, the transaction remains subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. It is anticipated that the closing of the transaction will occur in the first quarter of 2016. 

Cameron designs, manufactures, markets and services equipment used by the oil and gas industry and industrial manufacturing companies. Cameron is a leading international manufacturer of oil and gas pressure control and separation equipment, including valves, wellheads, controls, chokes, blowout preventers and assembled systems for oil and gas drilling, production and transmission used in onshore, offshore and subsea applications and provides oil and gas separation, metering and flow measurement equipment. Cameron reported revenue of $10.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets, managing its business through three Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production. Each Group consists of a number of technology-based service and product lines, or Technologies. These Technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which Schlumberger holds leading positions. The business is also reported through four geographic Areas: North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East &#38; Asia. Within these Areas, a network of GeoMarket* regions provides logistical, technical and commercial coordination. 

The role of the Groups and Technologies is to support Schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development. The Groups and Technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses, overseeing operational processes, resource allocation, personnel and delivering superior financial results. The GeoMarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions. The Areas and GeoMarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations.

The Groups are as follows:

&#183; 

Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) is a business model for field production projects. This model combines the required services and products of the Technologies with drilling rig management, specialized engineering and project management expertise to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement. 

SPM commercial arrangements create alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation. These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of Schlumberger&#8217;s customers&#8217; assets under long-term agreements. Schlumberger will invest its own services and products, and in some cases cash, into the field development activities and operations. Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products. Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis. This may include certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.

Schlumberger also has a 40% equity ownership interest in OneSubsea TM , a joint venture with Cameron. The joint venture manufactures and develops products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. Schlumberger&#8217;s 40% share of the net income of the joint venture is reflected in the results of the Production Group.

&#160;

Supporting the Technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers. Through this organization, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improv e productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner. 

Schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers, and the labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition, which vary geographically with respect to the different services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing geophysical services, wireline logging, well testing, exploration and production software, drilling and completion fluids, solids and waste management, coiled-tubing, drill bits, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, directional drilling services and mud logging. A large proportion of Schlumberger offerings is non-rig related; consequently, revenue does not necessarily correlate to the rig count.

GENERAL 

Intellectual Property 

Schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger&#8217;s business. While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger&#8217;s business. 

Seasonality 

Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that typically result in temporarily reduced levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets. 

Customers and Backlog of Orders 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than WesternGeco, Schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses. The WesternGeco backlog, which is based on signed contracts with customers, was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015 ($0.7 billion at December 31, 2014). 

Financial Information 

Financial information by business segment and geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 is provided in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements .
