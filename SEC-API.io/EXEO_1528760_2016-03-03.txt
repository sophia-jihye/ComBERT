 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Exeo Entertainment, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) designs, develops, licenses, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics in the video gaming, music and smart TV sector. Our current business objectives are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Complete product development and establish channels of distribution, and 

&#183; 

Expand SKUs within the headphone market for both music and gaming 

Activities to date 

&#160; 

We incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 12, 2011. We are a development stage company. From our inception to date we have generated minimal revenues and continue to operate at a loss. Our activities have centered on the design and engineering of peripherals in the video gaming, music, and smart TV sector. 

&#160; 

We accomplished the following: 

1) 

We completed the molds for the Psyko&#8482; PC model and are working on the molds for the Psyko&#8482; console unit. 

2) 

During the six months ending May 31, 2015, we received inventory of the Krankz&#8482; Bluetooth Wireless Headsets, and the Psyko&#174;5.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headsets (with built-in microphone) with external amplifier for Personal Computers. We also approved the working prototypes of the similar type of Psyko&#174; Krypton headphones for use with gaming consoles (such as Xbox&#174;), and the Company is ready to go forward with the manufacturing. 

3) 

We are currently working on molds for the Zaaz&#8482; keyboard. 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Products under development include the Psyko&#8482; 5.1 surround sound gaming headphones for consoles, Krankz&#8482; MAXX Bluetooth&#8482; wireless headphones, Zaaz&#8482; Smart TV keyboards, the Extreme Gamer&#174;; a multi-disc video game changer, and an android based portable gaming system. We are finalizing development on the Zaaz&#8482; keyboard and will soon begin tooling for manufacturing. The Extreme Gamer&#8482; and portable gaming system are still in development. We expect to release several new products in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. 

&#160; 

Strategy and Marketing Plan 

&#160; 

Once manufacturing is established, we intend on utilizing existing consumer electronics distributers, such as Synnex Corp. (SNX) and Ingram Micro to distribute our products to big box retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop, and Fry&#8217;s Electronics. We do not have distribution agreements with these companies at this time. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Psyko&#174; Krypton&#8482; Surround Sound Headphones 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

While our Psyko&#174; headphone offering differs from the competition in the method of 5.1-surround sound delivery, we will face competition from manufacturers with established channels of distribution, mature capital structures, and significantly larger marketing budgets. Well established gaming headphone manufacturers include Turtle Beach; a private company, Tritton &#8211; a subsidiary of Mad Catz Interactive (MCZ), and Astro Gaming which is a subsidiary of Skullcandy (SKUL). 

&#160; 

While other headphone manufacturers replicate 5.1 surround sound through Digital Signal Processing (DSP), the Psyko&#174; headphones use a patented method of sound delivery that does not require the use of DSP. Management believes that the difference in audio quality is a major differentiating factor between our product offering and what is currently available on the market. 

&#160; 

Krankz&#8482; Headphones 

The driver design provides a deep bass sound with clear midrange audio for a full-range for use up to 30&#8217; distance. These headsets work with most mobile devices and have a retractable, foldable design with built-in microphone and noise cancelling feature. We expect to face competition from lifestyle headphone companies such as Beats by Dr. Dre and Skull candy. These entities are well established and have a loyal customer following. We expect to carve out a niche within the market by initially marketing to the X games demographic through endorsements and sponsorships in Extreme sports such as motocross, supercross, snowboarding, surfing, skating, and similar such sports. 

&#160; 

Zaaz&#8482; Keyboard 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The majority of the competition in the Bluetooth wireless keyboard arena is concentrated amongst a few well-known companies such as Logitech&#174; (LOGI), Microsoft&#174; (MSFT), Apple&#174; (AAPL), and Samsung&#174; (SSNLF). While management believes that only Samsung makes keyboards specifically designed to interact with smart TVs, and that their keyboards only work with certain Samsung&#174; TVs, there can be no assurance that other companies do not currently manufacture, or plan to manufacture, such units in the future. Any such companies that manufacture keyboards capable of connecting to a smart TV would further increase competition. 

&#160; 

The Company intends on differentiating the Zaaz&#8482; keyboard through a set of features designed specifically for smart TV users. The Zaaz&#8482; keyboard features a customized set of &#8220;one touch access keys&#8221; that allows users to access specific, user defined features of the consumers smart TV. Examples include one touch access to the following: Netflix&#174;, Facebook&#174;, Hulu&#174;, and Amazon&#174;. Additionally, the Zaaz&#8482; keyboard will differentiate itself by including a full size track pad &#8211; built into the keyboard &#8211; to navigate, point, click, and select. 

Extreme Gamer&#174; 

&#160; 

The Extreme Gamer&#174; is a patent pending (patent application 12/543,296) multi-disc video game changer that connects to current generation video game consoles offered by Nintendo&#174;, Microsoft&#174;, and Sony&#174;. 

&#160; 

Management believes from attending the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on January 11-13, 2013, having a booth and its products on display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on June 11 &#8211; 13, 2013 (booth 4010), and from regularly reading Video Gaming news from sources such as IGN.com, EGNnow.com, 1up.com, and gamespot.com, that no other company is currently manufacturing a multi-disc video game changer. If such a unit is being made management is unaware of its existence. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Suppliers and Supplies 

&#160; 

Currently we have access to an adequate supply of products, from various manufacturers. These companies and their products are new, not well established, and are a subject to significant risk and uncertainty. 

&#160; 

Dependence on One or a few Major Customers 

&#160; 

We do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers into the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations and Concessions 

&#160; 

We executed a license agreement with Psyko Audio Labs Canada to manufacture and distribute the Carbon and Krypton line of patented headphones. US Patent # 8,000,486 (for the Psyko Krypton&#8482; surround sound gaming headphones.) With regard to intellectual property rights associated with Psyko&#174; Headphones, we have a license to use this mark as well as the patented technology. 

We entered into a license agreement with Digital Extreme Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (also referred to as DXT) for use of certain intellectual property associated with the products being designed and developed by us. The Black Widow keyboard is now known as the Zaaz keyboard. DXT worked to design and develop the Extreme Gamer as well as the Black Widow keyboard. We continue to work under a license agreement with DXT to advance the use of technologies designed by DXT. There is no licensing fee paid to DXT during the years ended November 30, 2014 and 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

DXT applied to the U.S. PTO for a patent of its Multi Video Game Changer. The agency assigned an application number of 12/543,296 to its application, which was published on February 25, 2010. The proposed 10 disk Video Game Changer is designed to interface directly with Sony PS3&#174;, Nintendo Wii&#174;, and Microsoft Xbox 360&#174;. The Company anticipates incorporating Blu-Ray&#174; compatible optics technology under a license agreement. This would allow users to insert Blu-Ray&#174; discs into the Video Game Changer, and once connected to the video game console, to play movies on television. Sony PS3&#174; is now capable of playing Blu-Ray&#174; discs, but only with a capacity for a single disk. This technology would provide for the loading of up to 10 DVD&#8217;s, CD&#8217;s or Blu-Ray&#174; discs into a single console that communicates with a video game console via USB. Furthermore, users would be able to plug in any external hard disc drive (&#8220;HDD&#8221;) directly into the console via an internal ATPI port, allowing movies, music and pictures to be played directly from the HDD. 

&#160; 

In regard to intellectual property rights associated with Krankz&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; wireless headphones, we do not have a federally registered trademark as to the word marks Krankz or Krankz Maxx. Therefore, we do not have the same presumptive rights which might otherwise apply had we obtained a federally registered trademark. We believe we have intellectual property rights to this mark under common law. If we are unable to register this mark, we may use an alternative name for these headphones. 

Subsidiaries 

We do not have any subsidiaries.
