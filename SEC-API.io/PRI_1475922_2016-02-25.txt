 I TEM 1. 

BUSINESS.

Primerica, Inc. (&#8220;Primerica&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;) is a leading distributor of financial products to middle income households in the United States and Canada with 106,710 licensed sales representatives at December 31, 2015. We assist our clients in meeting their needs for term life insurance, which we underwrite, and mutual funds, annuities and other financial products, which we distribute primarily on behalf of third parties. We insured approximately five million lives and have over two million client investment accounts at December 31, 2015. Our distribution model uniquely positions us to reach underserved middle income consumers in a cost effective manner and has proven itself in both favorable and challenging economic environments.

Our mission is to serve middle income families by helping them make informed financial decisions and providing them with a strategy and means to gain financial independence. Our distribution model is designed to:

&#160;

&#183; 

Address our clients&#8217; financial needs. Our licensed sales representatives primarily use our proprietary financial needs analysis tool (&#8220;FNA&#8221;) and an educational approach to demonstrate how our products can assist clients to provide financial protection for their families, save for their retirement and other needs, and manage their debt. Typically, our clients are the friends, family members and personal acquaintances of our sales representatives. Meetings are generally held in informal, face-to-face settings, usually in the clients&#8217; homes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Provide a business opportunity. We provide an entrepreneurial business opportunity for individuals to distribute our financial products. Low entry costs and the ability to begin part-time allow our sales representatives to supplement their income by starting their own independent businesses without incurring significant start-up costs or leaving their current jobs. Our unique compensation structure, technology, training and back-office processing are designed to enable our sales representatives to successfully grow their independent businesses. 

Corporate Structure

We conduct our core business activities in the United States through three principal entities, all of which are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent Company:

&#160;

&#183; 

Primerica Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;PFS&#8221;), our general agency and marketing company; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Primerica Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Primerica Life&#8221;), our principal life insurance underwriting company; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

PFS Investments Inc. (&#8220;PFS Investments&#8221;), our investment and savings products company, broker-dealer and registered investment advisor. 

Primerica Life is domiciled in Massachusetts, and its wholly owned subsidiary, National Benefit Life Insurance Company (&#8220;NBLIC&#8221;), is a New York-domiciled life insurance underwriting company.

We conduct our core business activities in Canada through three principal entities, all of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent Company:

&#160;

&#183; 

Primerica Life Insurance Company of Canada (&#8220;Primerica Life Canada&#8221;), our Canadian life insurance underwriting company; 

&#160;

&#183; 

PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. (&#8220;PFSL Investments Canada&#8221;), our Canadian licensed mutual fund dealer; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

PFSL Fund Management Ltd. (&#8220;PFSL Fund Management&#8221;), our Canadian investment funds manager. 

Primerica was incorporated in the United States as a Delaware corporation in October 2009 to serve as a holding company for the Primerica businesses (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;). Our businesses, which prior to April 1, 2010 were wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of Citigroup Inc. (&#8220;Citigroup&#8221;), were transferred to us by Citigroup on April 1, 2010 in a reorganization pursuant to which we completed an initial public offering in April 2010 (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;). On March 31, 2010, we entered into certain coinsurance transactions with entities then affiliated with Citigroup (the &#8220;IPO coinsurers&#8221;) and ceded between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009.

Our Clients

Our clients are generally middle income consumers, which we define as households with $30,000 to $100,000 of annual income. According to the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey, the latest period for which data is available, approximately 50% of U.S. households fall in this range. We believe that we understand the financial needs of the middle income segment which include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Many have inadequate or no life insurance coverage. Individual life insurance sales in the United States declined from 12.5 million policy sales in 1975 to 9.0 million policy sales in 2014, the latest period for which data is available, according to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association International, Inc. (&#8220;LIMRA&#8221;), a worldwide association of insurance and financial services companies. We believe that term life insurance, which we have provided to middle income clients for many years, is generally the best option for them to meet their life insurance needs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Many need help saving for retirement and other personal goals. Middle income families continually find it challenging to save for retirement and other goals. By developing personalized savings programs for our clients using our proprietary FNA and 

&#160;

offering a wide range of mu tual funds, annuities, managed investment s and segregated fund products sponsored and managed by reputable firms, our sales representatives are well equipped to help clients develop long-term savings plans to address their financial needs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Many need to reduce their consumer debt. Many middle income families have numerous debt obligations from credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages. We help our clients address these financial burdens by providing personalized, client-driven debt resolution techniques and third-party referrals that can help them reduce and ultimately pay off their debts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Many prefer to meet face-to-face when considering financial products. Historically, middle income consumers have indicated a preference to meet face-to-face when considering financial products or services. As such, we have designed our business model to address this preference in a cost-effective manner. 

Our Distribution Model

Our distribution model, which is based on a traditional insurance agency model and borrows aspects from franchising and direct sales, is designed to reach and serve middle income consumers efficiently through direct selling to customers by our sales representatives. Key characteristics of our unique distribution model include:

&#160;

&#183; 

Independent entrepreneurs: Our sales representatives are independent contractors building and operating their own businesses. This business-within-a-business approach means that our sales representatives are entrepreneurs who take responsibility for selling products, recruiting sales representatives, setting their own schedules and managing and paying the expenses associated with their sales activities, including office rent and administrative overhead. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Part-time opportunity: By offering a flexible part-time opportunity, we are able to attract a significant number of recruits who desire to earn supplemental income and generally concentrate on smaller-sized transactions typical of middle income consumers. Our sales representatives are able to join our sales force at minimal expense, and they receive technological support, pre-licensing training and licensing examination preparation programs. Our sales representatives sell or refer our products directly to consumers, and therefore our business opportunity does not require recruits to purchase and resell our products. Virtually all of our sales representatives begin selling our products on a part-time basis, which enables them to hold jobs while exploring an entrepreneurial business opportunity with us. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Incentive to build distribution: When a sale is made, the selling representative receives a commission, as does the licensed representative who recruited and supervises him or her in most cases, which we refer to as override compensation. Override compensation is paid through several levels of the selling representative&#8217;s recruitment and supervisory organization. This structure motivates existing sales representatives to grow our sales force and provides them with commission income from the sales completed by representatives in their downline sales organization. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sales force leadership : A sales representative who has built a successful organization and has obtained his or her life insurance and securities licenses can achieve the sales designation of Regional Vice President (&#8220;RVP&#8221;), which entitles him or her to earn higher compensation and bonuses. RVPs are independent contractors who open and operate offices for their sales organizations and devote their full-time attention to their Primerica businesses. RVPs also support and monitor the sales representatives, on whose sales they earn override commissions, in achieving compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. RVPs&#8217; efforts to expand their businesses are a primary driver of our success. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Innovative compensation system: We have developed an innovative system for compensating our independent sales force that is contingent upon product sales. We advance to our sales representatives a significant portion of their insurance commissions upon their submission of an insurance application and the first month&#8217;s premium payment. In addition to being a source of motivation, this upfront payment provides our sales representatives with immediate cash flow to offset costs associated with originating the business. In addition, monthly production bonuses are paid to RVPs whose downline sales organizations meet certain sales levels. With compensation tied to sales activity, our compensation approach accommodates varying degrees of individual productivity, which allows us to effectively use a large group of part-time sales representatives while providing a variable cost structure. In addition, we incentivize our RVPs with equity compensation on a quarterly basis, which aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Large, dynamic sales force: Members of our sales force primarily serve their friends, family members and personal acquaintances through individually driven networking activities. We believe that this warm market approach is an effective way to distribute our products because it facilitates face-to-face interaction initiated by a trusted acquaintance of the prospective client, which is difficult to replicate using other distribution approaches. Due to the large size of our sales force and our active recruiting of new sales representatives, our sales force is able to continually access an expanding base of prospective clients without engaging costly media channels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Motivational culture: In addition to the motivation for our sales representatives to achieve financial success, we seek to create a culture that inspires and rewards our sales representatives for their personal successes and those of their sales organizations through sales force recognition events and contests. We also use Internet-streamed broadcasts and local, regional and national meetings to inform and teach our sales representatives, as well as facilitate camaraderie and the exchange of ideas across the sales force organization. These initiatives encourage and empower our sales representatives to develop their own successful sales organizations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Inclusive culture : Building and maintaining an ethnically and demographically diverse sales force is important to us, as we believe our sales force does reflect the middle market communities we serve. As the communities we serve become more diverse, our salesforce does as well. 

Structure and Scalability of Our Sales Force 

New sales representatives are recruited by existing sales representatives. When these new recruits join our sales force, they are assigned an upline relationship with the sales representative who recruited them and with the recruiting sales representative&#8217;s respective upline RVP organization. As new sales representatives are successful in recruiting other sales representatives, they begin to build their own organization of sales representatives who become their downline sales representatives. We encourage our sales representatives to bring in new recruits to build their own sales organizations, enabling them to earn override commissions on sales made by members of their downline organization.

RVPs establish and maintain their own offices, which we refer to as field offices. Additionally, they are responsible for funding the costs of their administrative staff, marketing materials, travel and training and certain recognition events for the sales representatives in their respective downline organizations. Field offices provide a location for conducting recruiting meetings, training events and sales-related meetings, disseminating our Internet-streamed broadcasts, conducting compliance functions, and housing field office business records. Some business locations contain more than one onsite field office. At December 31, 2015, approximately 4,739 field offices in approximately 2,700 locations were managed by sales representatives that served as full-time RVPs.

Our sales-related expenses are largely variable costs that fluctuate with product sales volume. Sales-related expenses consist primarily of sales commissions and incentive programs for our sales representatives, as well as costs associated with information technology, compliance, administrative activities, sales management, and training.

With support provided by our home office staff, RVPs play a major role in training, motivating and monitoring their sales representatives. Because the sales representative&#8217;s compensation grows with the productivity of his or her downline organization, our distribution model provides financial rewards to sales representatives who successfully develop, support and monitor productive sales representatives. Furthermore, we have developed proprietary tools and technology to enable our RVPs to reduce the time spent on administrative responsibilities associated with their sales organizations so they can devote more time to the sales and recruiting activities that drive our growth. We believe that our tools and technology, coupled with our bonus and equity incentive award programs, further incentivize our sales representatives to become RVPs.

To encourage our most successful RVPs to build large downline sales organizations that generate strong sales volumes, we established the Primerica Ownership Program. This program provides qualifying RVPs a contractual right, upon meeting certain criteria, to transfer their Primerica businesses to another RVP or transfer it to a qualifying family member.

Both the structure of our sales force and the capacity of our support capabilities provide us with a high degree of scalability as we grow our business. Our support systems and technology are capable of supporting a large sales force and a high volume of transactions. In addition, by sharing training and compliance activities with our RVPs, we are able to grow without incurring proportionate overhead expenses.

Recruitment of Sales Representatives

The recruitment of sales representatives is undertaken by our existing sales representatives, who identify prospects and share with them the benefits of associating with our organization. Our sales representatives showcase our organization as dynamic and capable of improving lives by demonstrating the success achieved by the members of our sales force and the value of the solutions that we provide.

After the initial contact, prospective recruits typically are invited to an opportunity meeting, which is conducted by an RVP. The objective of an opportunity meeting is to inform prospective recruits about our mission and their opportunity to join our sales force. At the conclusion of each opportunity meeting, prospective recruits are asked to complete an application and pay us a nominal fee to commence their pre-licensing training and licensing examination preparation programs and, depending on the state or province, to cover their licensing exam registration costs, which are provided by the Company generally at no additional charge. Recruits are not obligated to purchase any of our products in order to become sales representatives, though they may elect to make such purchases.

Our sales force is our sole distribution channel for our term life insurance and investment and savings products, and our success depends on the ongoing recruitment, training and licensing of new sales representatives. Recruits may become our clients or provide us with access to their friends, family members and personal acquaintances. As a result, we continually work to improve our systematic approach to recruiting and training new sales representatives.

Similar to other distribution systems that rely upon part-time sales representatives and typical of the life insurance industry in general, we experience wide disparities in the productivity of individual sales representatives. Many new recruits do not get licensed, mainly due to the time commitment required to obtain licenses and various regulatory and licensing hurdles. Many of our licensed sales representatives are only marginally active in our business. As a result, we plan for this disparate level of productivity and view a continuous recruiting cycle as a key component of our distribution model. Our distribution model is designed to address the varying productivity associated with part-time sales representatives by paying production-based compensation, emphasizing recruiting, and developing initiatives to address barriers to licensing new recruits. By providing override commissions to sales representatives on the sales generated by their downline sales organization, our compensation structure aligns the interests of our sales representatives with our interests in recruiting new representatives and creating sustainable sales production.

We define new recruits as individuals who have submitted an application to join our sales force, together with payment of the nominal fee to commence their pre-licensing training. We may not approve certain new recruits to join our sales force, and others elect to withdraw from our sales force prior to becoming active in our business.

On average, it requires approximately three months for our sales representatives to complete the necessary applications and pre-licensing coursework and to pass the applicable state or provincial examinations to obtain a license to sell our term life insurance products. As a result, individuals recruited to join our sales force within a given fiscal period may not become licensed sales representatives until a subsequent period.

Sales Force Motivation, Training and Communication

Motivating, training and communicating with our sales force are critical to our success and that of our sales force.

Motivation. Through our proven system of sales force recognition events, contests, and communications, we provide incentives that drive our results. Motivation is driven in part by our sales representatives&#8217; belief that they can achieve higher levels of financial success by building their own businesses as Primerica sales representatives. The opportunity to help underserved middle income households address financial challenges is also a significant source of motivation for many of our sales representatives, as well as for our management and home office employees. 

We motivate our sales representatives to succeed in our business by:

&#160;

&#183; 

compensating our sales representatives for product sales by them and their downline organizations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

helping our sales representatives learn financial fundamentals so they can confidently and effectively assist our clients; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reducing the administrative burden on our sales force, which allows them to devote more of their time to building a downline organization and selling products; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

creating a culture in which sales representatives are encouraged to achieve goals through the recognition of their sales and recruiting achievements, as well as those of their sales organizations. 

To help our sales representatives understand that they are part of a larger enterprise than their field office, we conduct numerous local, regional and national meetings. These meetings inform and motivate our sales force. In July 2015, we hosted our biennial international convention at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, which was attended by approximately 40,000 people from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Many of our new recruits and sales representatives attended our biennial international convention and other meetings at their own expense, which we believe further demonstrates their commitment to our organization and mission.

Training. &#160; Our sales representatives must hold licenses to sell most of our products. Our in-house life insurance licensing program offers a significant number of classroom, online and self-study life insurance pre-licensing courses to meet applicable state and provincial licensing requirements and prepare recruits to pass applicable licensing exams. For those representatives who wish to sell our investment and savings products, we contract with third-party training firms to conduct exam preparation and also offer supplemental training tools. 

We provide courses, tools and incentives to help new recruits become licensed sales representatives. For example, we offer, generally at no cost to our sales force, a personalized study plan, a variety of review classes, and life insurance study and exam review videos and audios. With a subscription to our secure Internet website, new recruits in the U.S. gain access to an online exam simulator, a tool that uses a student&#8217;s prior performance to provide simulated exams that focus on individual study needs. In Canada, new recruits procure and utilize exam simulators that are provided by outside third parties. We also provide an online interactive tool that provides new recruits with a step-by-step guide to building their Primerica sales businesses.

Other internal training program opportunities include training modules and videos covering sales, management skills, business ownership, products and compliance. Additionally, many RVPs conduct sales training either on nights or weekends, providing new recruits a convenient opportunity to attend training outside of weekday jobs or family commitments.

Communication. We communicate with our sales force through multiple channels, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Primerica Online (&#8220;POL&#8221;), which is our secure Internet website designed to be a support system for our sales force. POL provides sales representatives with access to their Primerica e-mail, bulletins and alerts, business tracking tools and real-time updates on their pending life insurance applications and new recruits. We also use POL to provide real-time recognition of sales representatives&#8217; successes and scoreboards for sales force production, contests and trips. In addition, POL is a gateway to our 

&#160;

product providers and product support. A substantial majority of our sales representatives subscribe to POL. Subscribers generally pay a $25 monthly fee to subscribe to POL, which helps cover the cost of m aintai ning this support system. 

&#160;

&#183; 

our in-house broadcasts, which are delivered by Internet-streaming video. We create original broadcasts and videos that enable senior management to update our sales force and provide training and motivational presentations. We broadcast a live weekly program hosted by home office management and selected RVPs that focuses on new developments and provides motivational messages to our sales force. We also broadcast a training-oriented program to our sales force on a weekly basis and profile successful sales representatives, allowing these individuals to educate and train our other sales representatives by sharing their methods for success. 

&#160;

&#183; 

our publications department, which produces materials to support, motivate, and inform our sales force. We sell recruiting materials, sales brochures, business cards and stationery and provide total communications services, including web design, print presentations, graphic design and script writing. We also produce a weekly mailing that includes materials promoting our current incentives, as well as the latest news about our product offerings. 

Sales Force Support and Tools

Our information systems and technology are designed to support a sales and distribution model that relies on a large group of predominantly part-time sales representatives and assist them in building their own businesses. We provide our sales representatives with sales tools that allow both new and experienced sales representatives to offer financial information and products to their clients. The most significant of these tools are:

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Financial Needs Analysis (FNA): Our FNA is a proprietary, needs-based analysis tool. The FNA gives our sales representatives the ability to collect and synthesize client financial data and develop a financial analysis for the client that is easily understood. The FNA, while not a financial plan, provides our clients with a personalized explanation of how our products work and introduces prudent financial concepts, such as regular saving and accelerating the repayment of high cost credit card debt to help them reach their financial goals. The FNA provides clients with a snapshot of their current financial position and identifies their life insurance, savings and debt resolution needs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Point-of-Sale Application Tool: Our point-of-sale software, TurboApps, is an internally developed system that streamlines the application process for our insurance products. This application populates client information from the FNA to eliminate redundant data collection and provides real-time feedback to eliminate incomplete and illegible applications. Integrated with our paperless field office management system described below, and with our home office systems, TurboApps allows our RVPs and us to realize the efficiencies of straight-through-processing of application data and other information collected on our sales representatives&#8217; mobile devices, which results in expedited processing of our life insurance product sales. We also leverage the TurboApps concept with our investment partners to process mutual fund and annuity product sales. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Virtual Base Shop: In an effort to ease the administrative burden on RVPs and simplify sales force operations, we make available to RVPs a secure Internet-based paperless field office management system as part of the POL subscription. This virtual office is designed to automate the RVP&#8217;s administrative responsibilities and can be accessed by all sales representatives in an RVP&#8217;s immediate downline sales organization, which we refer to as his or her base shop. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other Tools : We utilize proprietary and third-party products for more efficient application processing, client support, and sales force administration, among other uses. For example, our Primerica App for Android and iOS is broadly used by our sales force for managing contacts, generating client proposals, and receiving and sending communications. In addition to our Primerica App, we continue to develop mobile applications as the use of mobile devices by our sales representatives increases. 

We also make available other technology to support our sales force in managing their businesses and in serving our clients, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

a toll-free sales support call center to address questions and assist with paperwork, underwriting and licensing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a tele-underwriting process that allows clients to provide needed medical information without disclosing it to our sales representatives; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

POL for tracking the status of pending life insurance applications and the progress of their new recruits in their training and licensing efforts. 

Performance-Based Compensation Structure

Our compensation system is rooted in our origin as an insurance agency. Our sales representatives can earn compensation in multiple ways, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

sales commissions and fees based on their personal sales and client assets under management; 

&#160;

&#183; 

override commissions based on sales by sales representatives and fees based on client assets under management in their downline organizations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

bonuses and other compensation, including equity-based compensation, based on their own sales performance, the aggregate sales performance of their downline organizations and other criteria; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

participation in our contests and other incentive programs. 

Our compensation system pays a commission to the sales representative who sells the product and override commissions to several levels of the selling representative&#8217;s upline organization. With respect to term life insurance sales, commissions are calculated based on the total first-year premium (excluding policy fee) for all policies and riders up to a maximum premium. To motivate our sales 

force, we compensate sales representatives for term life insurance product sales as quickly as possible. We advance a majority of the insurance commission upon the submissio n of a completed application and the first month&#8217;s premium payment. As the client makes his or her premium payments, the commission is earned by the sales representative and the commission advance is recovered by the Company. If premium payments are not ma de by the client and the policy terminates, any outstanding advance commission is charged back to the sales representative. The chargeback , which only occurs in the first year of a policy, would equal that portion of the advance that was made, but not earn ed, by the sales representative because the client did not pay the full premium for the period of time for which the advance was made to the sales representative. Chargebacks, which occur in the normal course of business, may be recovered by reducing any c ash amounts otherwise payab le to the sales representative. 

Sales representatives and their upline organizations are contractually obligated to repay us any commission advances that are ultimately not earned due to the underlying policy lapsing prior to the full commission being earned. Additionally, we hold back a portion of the commissions earned by our sales representatives as a reserve out of which we may recover chargebacks. The amounts held back are referred to as deferred compensation account commissions (&#8220;DCA commissions&#8221;). DCA commissions are available to reduce amounts owed to the Company by sales representatives. DCA commissions also provide an upline sales representative with a cushion against the chargeback obligations of their downline sales representatives. DCA commissions, unless applied to amounts owed, are ultimately released to sales representatives.

We pay most term life insurance commissions during the first policy year. One of our term riders provides for coverage increases after the first year. For such riders, we pay first year and renewal commissions only for premium increases related to the increased coverage. Additionally, we pay renewal commissions on some older in-force policies. At the end of the policy durations, we pay compensation on policy continuations and exchanges.

We also pay compensation to our sales force for the sale of mutual funds, annuities, prepaid legal services, the referral of customers seeking auto and home insurance, segregated funds, and other financial products. For most mutual funds (non-managed investments) and annuity products, commissions are paid both on the sale and on the value of assets under management and are calculated based on the dealer reallowance and trail compensation actually paid to us. For managed investment mutual fund products, fees earned are primarily based on the total of assets under management and represent the annual fee we receive as compensation for as long as we retain the account. Prepaid legal services commissions are paid in fixed amounts on the sale of the respective product. For auto and homeowners&#8217; insurance products, fees are paid for referrals that result in completed applications. We pay our sales representatives in Canada a sales commission on segregated fund sales and a quarterly fee based on clients&#8217; asset values. We also pay commissions to our sales force related to certain other financial products, which are calculated based on the type of product sold or referred.

We pay bonuses and other incentive compensation for the sale of certain products. Bonuses are paid to the representatives and RVPs or to selected override levels, or both, for achieving specified supervising production levels for the sale of term life insurance, investment and savings products and other distributed products.

In addition to these methods of compensation, we use a quarterly compensation program under which RVPs can earn equity awards based on various supervising production criteria. Effective deployment of these programs allows us to align the interests of our sales force with those of our stockholders.

Sales Force Licensing

The states, provinces and territories in which our sales representatives operate generally require our sales representatives to obtain and maintain licenses to sell our insurance and securities products, requiring our sales representatives to pass applicable examinations. Our sales representatives may also be required to maintain licenses to sell certain of our other financial products. To encourage new recruits to obtain their life insurance licenses, we either pay directly or reimburse the sales representative for certain licensing-related fees and expenses once he or she passes the applicable exam and obtains the applicable life insurance license.

To sell insurance products, our sales representatives must be licensed by their resident state, province or territory and by any other state, province or territory in which they do business. In most states, our sales representatives must be appointed by our applicable insurance subsidiary.

To sell mutual funds and variable annuity products, our U.S. sales representatives must be registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) and hold the appropriate license(s) designated by each state in which they sell securities products, as well as be appointed by the annuity underwriter in the states in which they market annuity products. Our representatives must meet all state and regulatory requirements and be designated as an investment advisor representative in order to sell our managed investment products.

Our Canadian sales representatives selling mutual fund products are required to be licensed by the securities regulators in the provinces and territories in which they sell mutual fund products. Our Canadian sales representatives who are licensed to sell our insurance products do not need any further licensing to sell our segregated funds products. In Canada, sales representatives who refer clients to a mortgage lender do not have to be licensed as a mortgage broker.

For sales of our supplemental products, appropriate state, provincial and territorial licensing may be required.

Supervision and Compliance 

To ensure compliance with various federal, state, provincial and territorial legal requirements, we and our RVPs share responsibility for maintaining an overall compliance program that involves compliance training and supporting and monitoring the activities of our sales representatives. We work with our RVPs to develop appropriate compliance procedures and systems.

Generally, all RVPs must obtain a principal license (FINRA Series 26 in the United States and Branch Manager license in Canada), and, as a result, they assume supervisory responsibility over the activities of their downline sales organizations. Additional supervision is provided by approximately 503 Offices of Supervisory Jurisdiction (&#8220;OSJs&#8221;), which are run by select RVPs who receive additional compensation for assuming additional responsibility for supervision and compliance monitoring across all product lines. OSJs are required to periodically inspect our field offices and report to us any compliance issues they observe. Our Field Supervision Department regularly assists the OSJs and communicates compliance requirements to them to ensure they properly discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In addition, our Compliance Department regularly runs surveillance reports designed to monitor the activity of our sales force and investigates any unusual or suspicious activity identified during these reviews or during periodic inspections of our RVP offices.

All of our sales representatives are required to participate in our annual compliance meeting, a program administered by our senior management and our legal and compliance staff at which we provide a compliance training overview across all product lines and require the completion of compliance checklists by each of our licensed sales representatives for each product he or she offers. Additionally, our sales representatives receive periodic compliance newsletters regarding new compliance developments and issues of special significance. Furthermore, the OSJs are required to complete an annual training program that focuses on securities compliance and field supervision.

Our Field Audit Department regularly conducts audits of all sales representative offices, including scheduled and no-notice audits. Our policy is to conduct approximately 50% of the field office audits on a no-notice basis. The Field Audit Department reviews all regulatory-required records that are not maintained at our home office. Any compliance deficiencies noted in the audit must be corrected, and we carefully monitor all corrective action. Field offices that fail an audit are subject to a follow-up audit in 150 days. Audit deficiencies are addressed through a progressive disciplinary structure that includes fines, reprimands, probations and terminations.

Our Products

Reflecting our philosophy of helping middle income clients with their financial product needs and ensuring compatibility with our distribution model, our products generally meet the following criteria:

&#160;

&#183; 

Consistent with sound individual finance principles: Products must be consistent with good personal finance principles for middle income consumers, such as financial protection, minimizing expenses, encouraging long-term savings and reducing debt. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Designed to support multiple client goals: Products are designed to address and support a broad range of financial goals rather than compete with or cannibalize each other. For example, term life insurance does not compete with mutual funds because term life has no cash value or investment element. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ongoing needs based: Products are designed to meet the ongoing financial needs of many middle income consumers. This long-term approach bolsters our relationship with our clients by allowing us to continue to serve them as their financial needs evolve. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Easily understood and sold: Products must be appropriate for distribution by our sales force, which requires that the application and approval process must be simple to understand and explain, and the likelihood of approval must be sufficiently high to justify the investment of time by our sales representatives. 

We use three operating segments to organize, evaluate and manage our business: Term Life Insurance, Investment and Savings Products, and Corporate and Other Distributed Products. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for certain financial information regarding our operating segments and the geographic areas in which we operate.

Term Life Insurance 

Through our three life insurance subsidiaries &#8211; Primerica Life, NBLIC and Primerica Life Canada &#8211; we offer term life insurance to clients in the United States, its territories, the District of Columbia and Canada. In 2014, the latest period for which data is available, we ranked as a leading provider of individual term life insurance in the United States in an annual study published by LIMRA.

We believe that term life insurance is a better alternative for middle income clients than cash value life insurance. Term life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit if the insured dies during the fixed coverage period of an in-force policy, thereby providing financial protection for his or her named beneficiaries in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Term insurance products, which are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, have no savings or investment features. By buying term life insurance rather than cash value life insurance, a policyholder initially pays a lower premium and, as a result, would have funds available to 

invest for retirement and other needs. We also believe that a person&#8217;s need for life insurance is inversely proportional to that person&#8217;s need for retirement savings, a concept we refer to as the theory of decreasing responsibility. Young adults with children, new mortgages and other obligations need to buy higher amounts of insurance to protect their family fr om the loss of future income resulting from the death of a primary bread winner. With its lower initial premium, term life insurance lets young families buy more coverage for their premium dollar when their needs are greatest and still have the ability to have funds for their reti rement and other savings goals. 

We design our term life insurance products to be easily understood by, and meet the needs of, our clients. Clients purchasing our term life insurance products generally seek stable, longer-term income protection products for themselves and their families. In response to this demand, we offer term life insurance products with level premium coverage periods that range from 10 to 35 years and a wide range of coverage face amounts. Additionally, certain term life insurance policies may be customized through the addition of riders to provide coverage for specific protection needs, such as mortgage and college expense protection. Policies remain in force until the expiration of the coverage period or until the policyholder ceases to make premium payments and terminates the policy. Premiums are guaranteed for policies issued in the United States for the initial term period, up to a maximum of 20 years. After 20 years, we have the right to raise the premium, subject to limits provided for in the applicable policy. In Canada, the amount of the premium is guaranteed for the entire term of the policy.

One of the innovative term life insurance products that we offer is TermNow, which is our rapid issue term life product that provides for face amounts of $300,000 (local currency) and below. TermNow allows a sales representative to take an online application and, with the client&#8217;s permission, allows the Company to access databases, including Medical Information Bureau (&#8220;MIB&#8221;) data in the United States and Canada and prescription drug and motor vehicle records in the United States, as part of the underwriting process. The Company uses this data and the client&#8217;s responses to application questions to determine any additional underwriting requirements. Results of these processes are reported in real time to our underwriting system, which then decides whether or not to rapidly issue a policy.

The average face amount of our in-force policies issued in 2015 was approximately $241,700. The following table sets forth selected information regarding our term life insurance product portfolio:

Pricing and Underwriting. We believe that effective pricing and underwriting are significant drivers of the profitability of our life insurance business and we have established our pricing assumptions to be consistent with our underwriting practices. We set pricing assumptions for expected claims, lapses and expenses based on our experience and other factors while also considering the competitive environment. These other factors include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

expected changes from relevant experience due to changes in circumstances, such as (i) revised underwriting procedures affecting future mortality and reinsurance rates, (ii) new product features, and (iii) revised administrative programs affecting sales levels, expenses, and client continuation or termination of policies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

observed trends in experience that we expect to continue, such as general mortality improvement in the general population and better or worse policy persistency (the period over which a policy remains in force) due to changing economic conditions. 

Under our current underwriting guidelines, we individually assess each insurable adult applicant and place each applicant into a risk classification based on current health, medical history and other factors. Each classification (generally preferred plus, preferred, non-tobacco and tobacco) has specific health criteria. We may decline an applicant&#8217;s request for coverage if his or her health or activities create unacceptable risks for us.

Our sales representatives ask applicants a series of yes or no questions regarding the applicant&#8217;s medical history. We may also consider information about the applicant from third-party sources, such as MIB, prescription drug databases, motor vehicle bureaus and physician statements. If we believe that follow up regarding an applicant&#8217;s medical history is warranted, we use a third-party provider and its trained personnel to contact the applicant by telephone to obtain a more detailed medical history. The report resulting from this tele-underwriting process is electronically transmitted to us and is evaluated in our underwriting process. For higher face amount, paramedical requirements are also needed. 

To accommodate the significant volume of insurance business that we process, we and our sales force use technology to make our operations more efficient. We provide an electronic life insurance application that supports TermNow and other term life insurance products. Approximately 91% of the life insurance applications we received in 2015 were submitted electronically. Our electronic life 

insurance application ensures that the application is submitted error-fr ee, collects the applicant&#8217;s electronic signatures and populates the RVP&#8217;s sales log. For paper applications, we use our proprietary review and screening system to automatically screen that an application meets regulatory and other requirements, as well as alert our application processing staff to any deficiencies with the application. If any deficiencies are noted, ou r application processing staff contact s the sales representative to obtain the necessary information. Once an application is complete, the pe rtinent application data is uploaded to our life insurance administrative systems, which manage the underwriting process by electronically analyzing data, recommending underwriting decisions, requirements for higher face amounts or older ages and communica ting with the sales representa tive and third-party service providers. 

Claims Management. Our insurance subsidiaries processed over 14,000 life insurance benefit claims in 2015 on policies underwritten by us and sold by our sales representatives. These claims fall into three categories: death, waiver of premium (applicable to disabled policyholders who purchased a rider pursuant to which Primerica agrees to waive remaining life insurance premiums during a qualifying disability), or terminal illness. The claim may be reported by our sales representative, a beneficiary or, in the case of qualifying disability or terminal illness, the policyholder. Following are the benefits paid by us for each category of claim:

We consider claims paid for terminal illness to be loans made to the beneficiary that are repaid to us upon death of the beneficiary from the death benefit.

In the United States, after coverage has been in force for two years, we may not contest the policy for misrepresentations in the application or the suicide of the insured. In Canada, we have a similar two-year contestability period, but we are permitted to contest insurance fraud at any time. As a matter of policy, we do not contest any coverage issued by us to replace the face amount of another insurance company&#8217;s individual coverage to the extent the replaced coverage would not be contestable by the replaced company. We believe this approach helps our sales representatives sell replacement policies, as it reassures clients that claims made under their replacement policies are not more likely to be contested as to the face amount replaced. Through our claims administration system, we record, process and pay the appropriate benefit for any reported claim. Our claims system is used by our home office investigators to order medical and investigative reports from third-party providers, calculate amounts due to the beneficiary (including interest), and report payments to the appropriate reinsurance companies.

Primerica Life, a Massachusetts domestic insurer, regularly consults the Social Security Administration&#8217;s Death Master File (&#8220;Death Master File&#8221;) in accordance with applicable state requirements. NBLIC, a New York domestic insurer, regularly consults the Death Master File in accordance with New York State insurance requirements. These processes help identify potential deceased policyholders for whom claims have not been presented in the normal course of business. If unreported deaths are identified, Primerica Life and NBLIC attempt to determine if a valid claim exists, to locate beneficiaries, and to pay benefits accordingly. Prior to 2011, the Company did not use the Death Master File in any aspect of its business.

Reinsurance. We use reinsurance primarily to reduce the volatility risk with respect to mortality. Since 1994, we have reinsured death benefits in the United States on a first dollar quota share yearly renewable term (&#8220;YRT&#8221;) basis. We pay premiums to each reinsurer based on rates in the applicable agreement. 

We generally reinsure 90% of all term life insurance policies sold in the United States, excluding coverage under certain riders. For policies sold in Canada, we now utilize a YRT reinsurance arrangement similar to our U.S. program. Prior to 2012, we reinsured a smaller proportion of the face amount for policies sold in Canada. We also reinsure substandard cases on a facultative basis to capitalize on the extensive experience some of our reinsurers have with substandard cases. A substandard case has a level of risk that is acceptable to us, but at higher premium rates than a standard case because of the health, habits or occupation of the applicant.

While our reinsurance agreements have indefinite terms, both we and our reinsurers are entitled to discontinue any reinsurance agreement as to future policies by giving advance notice of 90 days to the other. Each reinsurer&#8217;s ability to terminate coverage for existing policies is limited to circumstances such as a material breach of contract or nonpayment of premiums by us. Each reinsurer has the right to increase rates with certain restrictions. If a reinsurer increases rates, we have the right to immediately recapture the business. Either party may offset any balance due from the other party. For additional information on our reinsurance, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Financial Strength Ratings. Ratings with respect to financial strength are an important factor in establishing our competitive position and maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market our products. Ratings organizations review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. For additional information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Financial Ratings.&#8221; 

I nvestment and Savings Products 

We believe that middle income families have significant unmet retirement and other savings needs. Using our FNA tool, our sales representatives help our clients understand their current financial situation and how they can use time-tested financial principles, such as prioritizing personal savings, to reach their savings goals. Our products comprise basic saving and investment vehicles that seek to meet the needs of clients in all stages of life.

Through PFS, PFS Investments, Primerica Life Canada, PFSL Investments Canada, and our licensed sales representatives, we distribute and sell to our clients mutual funds, managed investments, variable and fixed annuities, fixed indexed annuities and segregated funds. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 23,660 of our sales representatives were licensed to distribute mutual funds in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Canada. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 13,300 of our sales representatives were licensed and appointed to distribute annuities in the United States and approximately 9,900 of our sales representatives were licensed to sell segregated funds in Canada.

Mutual Funds . In the United States, our licensed sales representatives primarily distribute mutual funds from the following select asset management firms: American Century Investments, American Funds, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Legg Mason and Pioneer. We have selling agreements with each of these fund companies and a number of other fund companies as previously noted. These firms have diversified product offerings, including domestic and international equity, fixed income and money market funds. Each firm has individual funds with long track records and each continually evaluates its fund offerings and adds new funds on a regular basis. Additionally, their product offerings reflect diversified asset classes and varied investment styles. We believe these asset management firms provide funds that meet the investment needs of our clients. 

During 2015, four of these fund families (Legg Mason, Invesco, American Funds and Franklin Templeton) accounted for approximately 95% of our mutual fund sales in the United States. Legg Mason and Invesco each have large wholesaling teams that support our sales force in distributing their mutual fund products. Our selling agreements with these firms all have indefinite terms and provide for termination at will. Each of these agreements authorizes us to receive purchase orders for shares of mutual funds or similar investments underwritten by the fund company and to sell and distribute the shares on behalf of the fund company. All purchase orders are subject to acceptance or rejection by the relevant fund company in its sole discretion. Purchase orders received by the fund company from us are accepted only at the then-applicable public offering price for the shares ordered (the net asset value of the shares plus any applicable sales charge).

In Canada, our sales representatives offer Primerica-branded Concert&#8482; Series funds, which accounted for approximately 35% of our Canadian mutual fund product sales in 2015. Our Concert&#8482; Series of funds consist of six different asset allocation funds with varying investment objectives ranging from fixed income to aggressive growth. Each Concert&#8482; Series fund is a fund of funds that allocates fund assets among equity and income mutual funds of AGF Funds, a major asset management firm in Canada. The asset allocation within each Concert &#8482; Series fund is determined on a contract basis by Morneau Shepell Asset and Risk Management Ltd. The principal non-proprietary funds that we offer our clients in Canada are funds of AGF Funds and Mackenzie Investments. Sales of these non-proprietary funds accounted for approximately 38% of mutual fund product sales in Canada in 2015. Like our U.S. fund family list, the asset management partners we have chosen in Canada have a diversified offering of equity, fixed income and money market funds, including domestic and international funds with a variety of investment styles.

A key part of our investment philosophy for our clients is the long-term benefits of dollar cost averaging through systematic investing. To accomplish this, we assist our clients by facilitating monthly contributions to their investment account by bank draft against their checking accounts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, average client assets held in qualified retirement plans in the United States and Canada accounted for an estimated 74% and 75% of total average client account assets, respectively. Our qualified retirement plans in Canada are considered registered retirement savings plans (&#8220;RRSP&#8221;). An RRSP is similar to an individual retirement account (&#8220;IRA&#8221;), in the United States in that, contributions are made to the RRSP on a pre-tax basis and income is earned on a tax-deferred basis. Our high concentration of retirement plan accounts and our systematic savings philosophy are beneficial to us as these accounts tend to have lower redemption rates than the industry and, therefore, generate more recurring asset-based revenues.

Managed Investments. PFS Investments is a registered investment advisor in the United States, and it offers a managed investments program under a contract with Lockwood Advisors, a registered investment advisor and unit of Bank of New York Mellon. The offering consists of a mutual fund advisory program with a $25,000 minimum initial investment. As part of our contract, Lockwood Advisors participates in the design and assists in the ongoing administration of the program, including the investment of client assets on a discretionary basis into one or more asset allocation portfolios. In contrast to our existing mutual fund and annuity business, clients do not pay an upfront commission in an advisory fee program; rather, they pay an annual fee based on the value of the assets in their account. 

Variable Annuities. Our U.S. licensed sales representatives also distribute variable annuities underwritten and provided by Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and its affiliates (&#8220;Lincoln National&#8221;), AXA Distributors, LLC, American General Life Insurance Company and its affiliates (&#8220;AIG&#8221;) and MetLife Investors and its affiliates. Variable annuities are insurance products that enable our clients to invest in accounts with attributes similar to mutual funds, but also have benefits not found in mutual funds, including death benefits that protect beneficiaries from losses due to a market downturn and income benefits that guarantee future income payments for the life of the policyholder(s). These companies bear the insurance risk on the variable annuities that we distribute. 

In 201 5 , we added an additional variab le annuity product issued by AIG . This product has unique features that complement our existing offerings and give our clients and representatives additional opportunities for tax deferred growth and guaranteed retirement income. 

Segregated Funds. In Canada, we offer segregated fund products, which are branded as our Common Sense Funds TM , that have some of the characteristics of our variable annuity products distributed in the United States. Our Common Sense Funds TM are underwritten by Primerica Life Canada and offer our clients the ability to participate in a diversified managed investments program that can be opened for as little as $25. While the assets and corresponding liability (reserves) are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, the assets are held in trust for the benefit of the segregated fund contract owners and are not commingled with the general assets of the Company. 

There are two fund products within our segregated funds offerings: the Asset Builder Funds and the Strategic Retirement Income Funds (&#8220;SRIF&#8221;). The investment objective of Asset Builder Funds is long-term capital appreciation combined with some guarantee of principal. Unlike mutual funds, our Asset Builder Funds product guarantees clients at least 75% of their net contributions (net of withdrawals) at the earlier of the date of their death or at the Asset Builder Funds&#8217; maturity dates, which is selected by the client. The portfolio consists of both equities and bonds with the equity component consisting of a pool of large cap Canadian equities and the bond component consisting of Canadian federal government zero coupon treasuries and government-backed floating rate notes. The portion of the Asset Builder Funds&#8217; portfolio allocated to zero coupon treasuries are held in sufficient quantity to satisfy the guarantees payable at the maturity date of each Asset Builder Fund. As a result, our potential loss exposure is very low as it comes from the guarantees payable upon the death of the client prior to the maturity date. 

The investment objective of the SRIF is to provide income during retirement plus the opportunity for modest capital appreciation. The SRIF invests in a maximum of 25% equities with the balance in fixed income securities. The product guarantees at least 75% of the clients net contributions (net of withdrawals) at the earlier of the date of their death or when the client attains age 100. All accounts in this Fund are held as Registered Retirement Income Funds which carry government mandated minimum annual withdrawals. Similar to the Asset Builder Funds, our potential exposure for loss associated with the SRIF is very low as its investment allocations are conservatively aligned with the risks of the client contracts. 

With the guarantee level at 75% and in light of the time until the scheduled maturity of our segregated funds contracts, we currently do not believe it is necessary to allocate any corporate capital as reserves for segregated fund contract benefits.

Many of our Canadian clients invest in segregated funds through a RRSP. Our Common Sense Funds&#8482; are managed by AGF Funds, one of Canada&#8217;s leading investment management firms and a leading provider of our mutual fund products.

Fixed Indexed Annuities. We offer fixed indexed annuity products in the U.S. through Lincoln National, AIG, and Universal Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Universal Life&#8221;) (Puerto Rico). These products combine safety of principal and guaranteed rates of return with additional investment options tied to stock market indices that allow for returns that move based on the performance of an index. We believe these and other fixed annuity products give both our life and securities representatives more ways to assist our clients with their retirement planning needs. 

Fixed Annuities. We sell fixed annuities underwritten by MetLife Investors USA Insurance Company and its affiliates in the U.S. Our current offering includes a fixed premium deferred annuity and a single premium immediate annuity. The fixed premium deferred annuity allows our clients to accumulate savings on a tax deferred basis with safety of principal and a guaranteed rate of return. The single premium immediate annuity provides clients with an immediate income alternative. In Puerto Rico, we currently offer two annuity products: a fixed annuity and a fixed bonus annuity underwritten by Universal Life. These products provide guarantees against loss with several income options. 

Investment and Savings Products Revenue. In the United States, we earn revenue from our investment and savings products business in three ways: commissions earned on the sale of such products; fees earned based upon client asset values; and account-based revenue. On the sale of mutual funds (not including managed investments) and annuities, we earn a dealer reallowance or commission on new purchases as well as trail commissions on the assets held in our clients&#8217; accounts. We also receive marketing and support fees from most of our fund providers. These payments are typically a percentage of sales or a percentage of the clients&#8217; total asset values, or a combination of both. For managed investments, we receive an asset-based fee as compensation for asset management services, recordkeeping services, and marketing and support services. 

We perform custodial services and receive fees on a per-account basis for serving as a non-bank custodian for certain of our clients&#8217; retirement plan accounts for certain of the funds offered in the United States. We also perform recordkeeping services for some of our select U.S. fund companies and receive compensation on a per-account basis for these services. Because the total amount of these fees fluctuates with the number of such accounts, the opening or closing of accounts has a direct impact on our revenues. From time to time, the fund companies for whom we provide these services request that accounts with small balances be closed.

In Canada, we earn revenue from the sales of our investment and savings products in two ways: commissions (or dealer reallowance) on mutual fund sales and fees paid based upon clients&#8217; asset values (mutual fund trail commissions and asset management fees from segregated funds and Concert&#8482; Series funds). On segregated funds, we also earn deferred sales charges for early withdrawals at an annual declining rate within seven years of an investor&#8217;s original contribution. 

Other Distributed Products 

We offer other products, including prepaid legal services, auto and homeowners&#8217; insurance referrals, credit information services, long-term care insurance, health insurance, and debt resolution referrals. In Canada, we also offer mortgage loan referrals and insurance offerings for small businesses. While many of these products are Primerica-branded, all of them are underwritten or otherwise provided by a third party.

We offer our U.S. and Canadian clients a Primerica-branded prepaid legal services program on a subscription basis that is underwritten and provided by Pre-paid Legal Services, Inc. The prepaid legal services program offers a network of attorneys in each state, province or territory to assist subscribers with legal matters such as drafting wills, living wills and powers of attorney, trial defense and motor vehicle-related matters. We receive a commission based on our sales of these subscriptions.

We have an arrangement with Answer Financial, Inc. (&#8220;Answer Financial&#8221;), an independent insurance agency, whereby our U.S. sales representatives refer clients to Answer Financial to receive multiple, competitive auto and homeowners&#8217; insurance quotes. Answer Financial&#8217;s comparative quote process allows clients to easily identify the underwriter that is most competitively priced for their type of risk. We receive commissions based on completed auto and homeowners&#8217; insurance applications and pay our sales representatives a flat referral fee for each completed application.

We offer credit information services in the United States and Canada. Credit information products allow clients to access their credit score and other personal credit information. Clients also have the capability of creating a simple-to-understand plan for paying off their debts with information from their credit file. Our credit information products are co-branded with and supported by a subsidiary of Equifax Inc.

We have an arrangement with LTCI Partners, LLC (&#8220;LTCI Partners&#8221;), an independent brokerage general agency specializing in long-term care insurance, whereby our U.S. sales representatives refer clients to LTCI Partners to receive a long-term care insurance quote. Many of these policies are underwritten and provided by Genworth Life Insurance Company and its affiliates and some by various other insurance providers. We receive commissions based on the annualized premium of placed and taken policies.

In 2015, we entered into a distribution agreement with GoHealth, LLC (&#8220;GoHealth&#8221;), an operator of a private health insurance marketplace that allows U.S. consumers to enroll in health insurance compliant with the Affordable Care Act. Beginning with the 2016 open enrollment period, our representatives with health insurance licenses can refer clients to shop for affordable health insurance provided by a number of major carriers on GoHealth&#8217;s private exchange platform. We receive commissions from health insurance carriers for policies issued to clients we refer based on the unsubsidized policy premium. 

We have an arrangement with Freedom Financial Network, LLC, an independent limited liability company and its affiliates (collectively, &#8220;FFN&#8221;), whereby our U.S. sales representatives refer clients to FFN to receive solutions for resolving unmanageable debt. FFN&#8217;s debt solutions include a debt resolution program, whereby FFN acts as the credit advocate for its clients by negotiating discounts to resolve unsecured debts, and a federal income tax debt resolution program. We receive fees from FFN based on referred clients&#8217; enrollments in FFN&#8217;s debt and tax resolution programs, and we pay our sales representatives a scheduled fee with respect to qualified enrollments.

In Canada, we have a referral program for mortgage loan products offered by a third-party lender, B2B Bank. Due to regulatory requirements, our sales representatives in Canada only refer clients to the lender and are not involved in the loan application and closing process.

In Canada, we offer insurance products, including supplemental medical and dental, accidental death, and disability, to small businesses. These insurance products are underwritten and provided by The Edge Benefits Inc. and its affiliates. We receive a commission based on our sales of these policies and any subsequent renewals.

Prior to 2015, we offered student life and short-term disability benefit insurance, which were underwritten through NBLIC. These products were distributed solely by outside third parties. In 2014, NBLIC sold its short-term disability benefit business to AmTrust North America, Inc. and ceased the marketing and underwriting of new student life insurance policies. NBLIC will continue to administer the existing block of student life business.

Regulation

Our operations are subject to extensive laws and governmental regulations, including administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. The purpose of the laws and regulations affecting our operations is primarily to protect our clients and other consumers. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Insurance and securities regulatory authorities periodically make inquiries regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. At any given time, a number of financial or market conduct examinations of our subsidiaries may be ongoing. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted.

Regulation of Our Insurance Business. Primerica Life, as a Massachusetts domestic ins urer, is regulated by the Massachusetts DOI and is licensed to transact business in the United States (except New York), the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories. NBLIC, as a New York domestic insurer and a wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life, is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (&#8220;NYSDFS&#8221;) and is licensed to transact business in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

State insurance laws and regulations regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance business. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and, in some instances, discretionary power dealing with many aspects of our business, which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers, and capital adequacy.

Primerica Life Canada is required to file certain annual, quarterly and periodic reports with the supervisory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. These examinations generally are conducted under National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) guidelines. Under the rules of these jurisdictions, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to five years) by one or more of the supervisory agencies on behalf of the states in which they do business. The most recent periodic insurance department examinations of Primerica Life and NBLIC are currently in progress but the prior periodic examinations for these companies have not produced any significant adverse findings.

Primerica Life Canada is federally incorporated and provincially licensed. It transacts business in all Canadian provinces and territories. Primerica Life Canada is regulated federally by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (&#8220;OSFI&#8221;) and provincially by the Superintendents of Insurance for each province and territory. Federal and provincial insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. OSFI regulates insurers&#8217; corporate governance, financial and prudential oversight, and regulatory compliance, while provincial and territorial regulators oversee insurers&#8217; market conduct practices and related compliance.

Our Canadian insurance subsidiary files quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;) and other locally accepted standards with OSFI in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. OSFI conducts periodic detailed examinations of insurers&#8217; business and financial practices, including the control environment, internal and external auditing and minimum capital adequacy, surpluses and related testing, legislative compliance and appointed actuary requirements. These examinations also address regulatory compliance with anti-money laundering practices, outsourcing, related-party transactions, privacy and corporate governance. Provincial regulators conduct periodic market conduct examinations of insurers doing business in their jurisdiction.

In addition to federal and provincial oversight, Primerica Life Canada is also subject to the guidelines set out by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (&#8220;CLHIA&#8221;). CLHIA is an industry association that works closely with federal and provincial regulators to establish market conduct guidelines and sound business and financial practices addressing matters such as sales representative suitability and screening, insurance illustrations and partially guaranteed savings products.

The laws and regulations governing our U.S. and Canadian insurance businesses include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including policy filings, payment of insurance commissions, disclosures, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaints and claims handling. The state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States and the federal and provincial regulators in Canada generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

In addition, most U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories, as well as the Canadian federal government, have laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy. As discussed previously, U.S. state insurance law and Canadian provincial insurance law also require certain licensing of insurers and their agents.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation; Limitations on Dividends. The states in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted legislation and adopted regulations regarding insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of, and periodic reporting by, insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction that control, or are controlled by, other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them. 

The Parent Company is a holding company that has no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries, and our primary liability is $375.0 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the &#8220;Senior Notes&#8221;). As a result, we depend on dividends or other distributions from our insurance and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on, and repayment of, principal of any debt obligations.

The states in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay dividends to us. In Canada, dividends can be paid subject to the paying insurance company&#8217;s continuing compliance with regulatory requirements and upon notice to OSFI. We determine the dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries using statutory accounting principles (&#8220;SAP&#8221;) promulgated by the NAIC in the United States and IFRS in Canada.

The following table sets forth the statutory value of cash and securities dividends paid or payable by our insurance subsidiaries:

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency Analysis . Under the laws and regulations of their jurisdictions of domicile, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life insurance statutory reserves. In addition, other U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, then the affected insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries most recently submitted these opinions without qualification as of December 31, 2015 to applicable insurance regulatory authorities. 

Primerica Life Canada also is required to conduct regular analyses of the sufficiency of its life insurance statutory reserves. Life insurance reserving and reporting requirements are completed by Primerica Life Canada&#8217;s appointed actuary. Materials provided by the appointed actuary are filed with OSFI as part of our annual filing and are subject to OSFI&#8217;s review. Based upon this review, OSFI may institute remedial action against Primerica Life Canada as OSFI deems necessary. Primerica Life Canada has not been subject to any such remediation or enforcement by OSFI.

Surplus and Capital Requirements . U.S. insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with the ongoing licensing of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if, in the regulators&#8217; judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition. Insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year. We do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our U.S. insurance subsidiaries may issue. 

The NAIC has established risk-based capital (&#8220;RBC&#8221;) standards for U.S. life insurance companies, as well as a model act to be applied at the state level. The model act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual RBC report to state regulators reporting their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to various asset, premium and reserve items, with the factor being higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. If an insurer&#8217;s RBC falls below specified levels, then the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level. These actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control. As of December 31, 2015, Primerica Life and its subsidiaries had statutory capital and surplus in excess of the applicable regulatory thresholds.

In Canada, OSFI has authority to request an insurer to enter into a prudential agreement implementing measures to maintain or improve the insurer&#8217;s safety and soundness. OSFI also may issue orders to an insurer directing it to refrain from unsafe or unsound practices or to take action to remedy financial concerns. OSFI has neither requested that Primerica Life Canada enter into any prudential agreement nor has OSFI issued any order against Primerica Life Canada.

In Canada, OSFI oversees an insurer&#8217;s minimum capital requirement and determines the sum of capital requirements for five categories of risk: asset default risk, mortality/morbidity/lapse risks, changes in interest rate environment risk, segregated funds risk and foreign exchange risk. As of December 31, 2015, Primerica Life Canada had statutory capital in excess of the applicable regulatory thresholds.

NAIC Pronouncements and Reviews . The NAIC promulgates model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states in order to standardize insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance. Although many state regulations emanate from NAIC model statutes and pronouncements, SAPs continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Certain changes to NAIC model statutes and pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, may take effect automatically without affirmative action by a given state. With respect to some financial regulations and guidelines, non-domiciliary states sometimes defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of the state of domicile. However, neither the action of the domiciliary state nor the action of the NAIC is binding on a non-domiciliary state. Accordingly, a non-domiciliary state could choose to follow a different interpretation. 

The NAIC has established guidelines to assess the financial strength of insurance companies for U.S. state regulatory purposes. The NAIC conducts annual reviews of the financial data of insurance companies primarily through the application of 12 financial ratios 

prepared on a statutory basis. The annual statements are submitted to state insurance departments to assist them in monitoring insu rance companies in their state. 

Statutory Accounting Principles . SAP is a basis of accounting developed by U.S. insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer&#8217;s ability to pay all of its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer&#8217;s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles and related regulations determine, among other things, the amounts our insurance subsidiaries may ultimately pay to us as dividends, and they differ in many instances from U.S generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), which are designed to measure a business on a going-concern basis. Under U.S. GAAP, certain expenses are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. The valuation of assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP is based in part upon best estimate assumptions made by the insurer. U.S. GAAP-basis stockholders&#8217; equity represents the ownership interest in the U.S. GAAP-measured net assets held by stockholders. As a result, the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP will be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP. 

State Insurance Guaranty Funds Laws . Under most state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. Most insurance guaranty fund laws currently provide that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer&#8217;s own financial strength. In addition, assessments may be partially offset by credits against future state premium taxes. 

Additional Oversight in Canada . The Minister of Finance (Canada) under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) approved our indirect acquisition of Primerica Life Canada in April 2010. The Minister expects that a person controlling a federal insurance company will provide ongoing financial, managerial or operational support to its subsidiary should such support prove necessary. The Minister required us to sign a support principle letter, which provides, without limiting the scope of the support principle letter, that this ongoing support may take the form of additional capital, the provision of managerial expertise or the provision of support in such areas as risk management, internal control systems and training. The provision of the support principle letter is intended to ensure that the person controlling the federal insurance company is aware of the importance and relevance of the support principle in the consideration of the application. However, the letter does not create a legal obligation on our part to provide the support. Primerica Life Canada is currently in compliance with the terms of the support principle letter. 

From time to time, various jurisdictions make changes to the state or provincial licensing examination process that may make it more difficult for our sales representatives to obtain their life insurance licenses. For example, the insurance regulators in Canada will be implementing a new life insurance licensing examination program on January 1, 2016. We believe that the new licensing program has the potential to result in a decrease in the number of applicants who obtain their life insurance licenses in Canada. However, we have undertaken efforts to adapt our licensing process to the new program in order to help mitigate any such decline. In addition, the Canadian regulators have committed to evaluate the new program in an effort to ensure that it will remain an entry level credentialing exam constructed in accordance with generally accepted psychometric principles . For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors . &#8221;

Regulation of Our Investment and Savings Products Business. PFS Investments is registered with, and regulated by, FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). It is subject to regulation by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the &#8220;MSRB&#8221;) with respect to 529 plans, by the Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) with respect to certain retirement plans, and by state securities agencies. PFS Investments operates as an introducing broker-dealer and is registered in all 50 U.S. states and certain territories and with the SEC. As such, it performs the suitability review of investment recommendations in accordance with FINRA requirements, but it does not hold client accounts. U.S. client funds are held by the mutual fund in which such client funds are invested or by the annuity underwriters in the case of variable annuities. 

The SEC rules and regulations that currently apply to PFS Investments and our registered representatives generally require that we make suitable investment recommendations to our customers and disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the recommendations or advice we provide. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) gave the SEC the power to impose on broker-dealers a heightened standard of conduct (fiduciary duty) that is currently applicable only to investment advisors. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in January 2011, the SEC staff submitted a report to Congress in which it recommended that the SEC adopt a fiduciary standard of conduct for broker-dealers that is uniform with that of investment advisors. The SEC has slated the rule on its regulatory agenda for &#8220;long-term action&#8221; without a specific timetable.

On April 14, 2015, the DOL published a proposed regulation (the &#8220;DOL Proposed Rule&#8221;), which would more broadly define the circumstances under which a person or entity may be considered a fiduciary for purposes of the prohibited transaction rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and Internal Revenue Code (&#8220;IRC&#8221;) Section 4975. IRC Section 4975 prohibits certain types of compensation paid by third parties with respect to transactions involving assets in qualified accounts, including IRAs. The DOL Proposed Rule fulfills the announcement of the DOL in September 2011 that it would withdraw a proposed rule published in October 2010 and propose a new rule defining the term &#8220;fiduciary&#8221;. Simultaneously with publication of the DOL Proposed Rule, the DOL proposed new, and amended existing, exemptions (the &#8220;Prohibited Transaction Exemptions&#8221;) intended, among other things, to allow advisers and their firms to continue to receive common forms of compensation that would otherwise be prohibited due to the 

DOL Proposed Rule, provided the conditions of the exemptions are met. The DOL has received comments on the DOL Proposed Rule, held public hearings, and received supplemental comments. The DOL has completed the process of reviewing the extensive comments from stakeholders and making its final revisions to the DOL Proposed Rule. On Januar y 28, 2016, the DOL sent the final version of its proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (the &#8220;OMB&#8221;), which is responsible for reviewing the final proposed rule. Upon completion of its review, the OMB will publicly release the final proposed rule, which will allow the Company and other stakeholders the opportunity to see the rule in its final form for the first time. For more information, see &#8220;Risk Factors . &#8221; 

PFS Investments is also approved as a non-bank custodian under Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) regulations and, in that capacity, may act as a custodian or trustee for certain retirement accounts. Our sales representatives who sell securities products through PFS Investments are required to be registered representatives of PFS Investments. All aspects of PFS Investments&#8217; business are regulated, including sales methods and charges, trade practices, the use and safeguarding of customer securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, conduct and supervision of its employees.

PFS Investments is also an SEC-registered investment advisor and, under the name Primerica Advisors, offers a managed investments, or mutual fund advisory, program. In most states, our representatives are required to obtain an additional license to offer this program.

Primerica Shareholder Services, Inc. (&#8220;PSS&#8221;) is registered with the SEC as a transfer agent and, accordingly, is subject to SEC rules and examinations. Acting in this capacity, PSS and third-party vendors employed by PSS are responsible for certain client investment account shareholder services.

PFSL Investments Canada is a mutual fund dealer registered with and regulated by the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (the &#8220;MFDA&#8221;), the national self-regulatory organization for the distribution side for the Canadian mutual fund industry. It is also registered with provincial and territorial securities commissions throughout Canada. As a registered mutual fund dealer, PFSL Investments Canada performs the suitability review of mutual fund investment recommendations, and like our U.S. broker-dealer, it does not hold client accounts.

PFSL Investments Canada sales representatives are required to be registered in the provinces and territories in which they do business, including regulation by the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers in Quebec, and are also subject to regulation by the MFDA. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business and impose censures or fines for failure to comply with the law or regulations.

PFSL Fund Management in Canada is registered as an Investment Fund Manager in connection with our Concert&#8482; Series mutual funds and is regulated by provincial securities commissions.

Other Laws and Regulations. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 

U.S. federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Similarly, federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information. In particular, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others (including certain life insurers), the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic storage and transmission of such information. Congress and state legislatures are expected to consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information.

The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (&#8220;FCAC&#8221;), a Canadian federal regulatory body, is responsible for ensuring that federally regulated financial institutions, which include Primerica Life Canada and PFSL Investments Canada, comply with federal consumer protection laws and regulations, voluntary codes of conduct and their own public commitments. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (&#8220;FINTRAC&#8221;) is Canada&#8217;s financial intelligence unit. Its mandate includes ensuring that entities subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act comply with reporting, recordkeeping and other obligations under that act. We are also subject to privacy laws under the jurisdiction of federal and provincial privacy commissioners, anti-money laundering laws enforced by FINTRAC and OSFI, and the consumer complaints provisions of federal insurance laws under the mandate of the FCAC, which requires insurers to belong to a complaints ombud-service and file a copy of their complaints handling policy with the FCAC.

Segment Financial and Geographic Disclosures

We have two primary operating segments &#8212; Term Life Insurance and Investment and Savings Products. The Term Life Insurance segment includes underwriting profits on our in-force book of term life insurance policies, net of reinsurance, which are underwritten by our life insurance company subsidiaries. The Investment and Savings Products segment includes mutual funds, managed investments and annuities distributed through licensed broker-dealer subsidiaries and includes segregated funds, an individual annuity savings product that we underwrite in Canada through Primerica Life Canada. We also have a Corporate and Other Distributed 

Products segment, which consists of the majority of net investment income earned by our invested asset port folio, realized gains and losses on invested assets, interest expense on notes payable and reserve financing transactions, and revenues and expenses related to the dis tribution of non-core products. 

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 3 (Segment and Geographical Information) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information concerning our domestic and international operations and our operating segments.

For information on risks relating to our Canadian operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risks &#8211; Canadian Currency Risk.&#8221;

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment with respect to the sale of financial products and for retaining our more productive sales representatives. Because we offer several different financial products, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, such as insurance companies and brokers, banks, finance companies, credit unions, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies and other financial products and services companies.

Competitors with respect to our term life insurance products consist both of stock and mutual insurance companies, as well as other financial intermediaries. Competitive factors affecting the sale of life insurance products include the level of premium rates, benefit features, risk selection practices, compensation of sales representatives and financial strength ratings from ratings agencies such as A.M. Best.

In offering our securities products, our sales representatives compete with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisors, mutual fund companies and other direct distributors. The mutual funds that we offer face competition from other mutual fund families and alternative investment products, such as exchange-traded funds. Our annuity products compete with products from numerous other companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of annuity products include price, product features, investment performance, commission structure, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, service, and distribution capabilities.

Information Technology

We built a sophisticated information technology platform to support our clients, operations and sales force. Located at our main campus in Duluth, Georgia, our data center houses an enterprise-class IBM mainframe that serves as the repository for all client and sales force data and operates as a database server for our distributed environment. Our business applications, many of which are proprietary, are supported by application developers and data center staff at our main campus. Our information security team provides services that include project consulting, threat management, application and infrastructure assessments, secure configuration management, and information security administration. This infrastructure also supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions for business resumption in the event of a disaster.
