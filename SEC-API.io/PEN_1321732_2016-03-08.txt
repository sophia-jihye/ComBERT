 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

References herein to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; and &#8220;Penumbra,&#8221; refer to Penumbra, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states otherwise. 

Penumbra is a global interventional therapies company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets innovative medical devices. We have a broad portfolio of products that addresses challenging medical conditions and significant clinical needs across two major markets, neuro and peripheral vascular. The conditions that our products address include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and various peripheral vascular conditions that can be treated through thrombectomy and embolization procedures. 

We are an established company focused on the neuro market, and we recently expanded our business to include the peripheral vascular market. We focus on developing, manufacturing and marketing products for use by specialist physicians, including interventional neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional neurologists, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. We design our products to provide these specialist physicians with a means to drive improved clinical outcomes through faster and safer procedures. 

We attribute our success to our culture built on cooperation, our highly efficient product innovation process, our disciplined approach to product and commercial development, our deep understanding of our target end markets and our relationships with specialist physicians. We believe these factors have enabled us to rapidly innovate in a highly capital-efficient manner. 

Since our founding in 2004, we have had a strong track record of organic product development and commercial expansion that has established the foundation of our global organization. Some of our key accomplishments include: 

&#8226; 

launching our first product, for neurovascular access, in the U. S. in 2007; 

&#8226; 

establishing our direct neuro salesforce in the U. S. and Europe in 2008; 

&#8226; 

launching the first 510(k)-cleared, aspiration-based product for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients in 2008, and launching four subsequent generations of that product; 

&#8226; 

launching our first neurovascular coil for the treatment of brain aneurysms in 2011; 

&#8226; 

launching our first peripheral vascular product in 2013; and 

&#8226; 

establishing our direct peripheral vascular salesforce in the U. S. and Europe in 2014. 

We sell our products to hospitals primarily through our direct sales organization in the U. S., most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. In 2015, we generated revenue of $186.1 million , which represents a 48.3% &#32;increase over 2014 , and $4.2 million &#32;in operating income as compared to an operating income of $3.0 million &#32;in 2014 . For the year ended December 31, 2014 , we generated revenue of $125.5 million , which represented a 41.3% &#32;increase over 2013 , and $3.0 million &#32;in operating income as compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million in 2013 . 

Our Products 

Since our founding in 2004, we have invested in expanding our product development and marketing capabilities. These investments have included engineering and materials science capabilities, pre-clinical and bench-testing infrastructure and in-house clinical and regulatory infrastructure. Our fully-integrated organization has enabled us to launch 16 product brands for access, thrombectomy and embolization since 2007 to service our two target end markets. The following table summarizes our product offerings in each of our target end markets: 

OUR NEURO PRODUCTS 

Neurovascular Access 

Accessing the brain through the tortuous neurovasculature has been a substantial challenge for physicians treating vascular disorders in the brain. Companies developing products for neurovascular applications have historically leveraged technologies developed for use in coronary or peripheral vascular interventions. This approach created challenges given the vastly different anatomy, structure and sizing of the neurovascular vessels. 

Our portfolio of neurovascular access products includes our Neuron Access System catheters, BENCHMARK Intracranial Access System catheters and a variety of microcatheters. 

Neuron Access System 

We recognized the challenges posed by existing access technologies and focused our initial efforts on developing a guide catheter system designed specifically for neurointerventional procedures. Our Neuron delivery catheter is a variable stiffness guide catheter with increased support in the aortic arch, which enables trackability to access the intracranial vasculature. The design of Neuron enables physicians to position the catheter much higher in the anatomy than conventional guide catheters. 

We believe the Neuron family of guide catheters and the Penumbra distal delivery catheters that we subsequently introduced have enabled many neuro-endovascular procedures that previously had not been possible in the tortuous anatomy of the neurovasculature. We have continued our development and currently offer a wide range of catheters that enable delivery of the different therapeutic catheters that are required for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke interventions. Our Neuron products include the following: 

&#8226; 

The Neuron Intracranial Access System &#32;is indicated for the introduction of interventional devices into the peripheral, coronary and neuro vasculature. The system is a two-catheter system comprised of the Neuron Delivery Catheter and the Select Catheter. 

&#8226; 

The Neuron Delivery Catheter &#32;is a variable stiffness, large lumen catheter that combines proximal arch support with a microcatheter-like distal segment that is designed to access the intracranial anatomy. The Neuron can be used individually with a 0.038 inch guidewire, or together with the Neuron Select Catheter, to access the desired location. 

&#8226; 

The Select Catheter &#32;is a single lumen, braid-reinforced, torquable catheter with a radiopaque distal end and a hub on the proximal end. The Select Catheter enables primary access with the Neuron Delivery Catheters, obviating the need for an extra guide catheter. 

&#8226; 

The Neuron MAX System &#32;is an additional configuration to the currently available Neuron Intracranial Access System. The Neuron MAX System is a long sheath catheter with a flexible distal tip for neurovascular use and provides a larger lumen to enable a wide range of device compatibility in neurovascular procedures. 

BENCHMARK Intracranial Access System 

Advances in our catheter technology, driven largely by our advances in ischemic stroke therapy, have enabled us to further develop our intracranial access category of products. Our latest development in this category is the BENCHMARK catheter, which features additional improvements in ease-of-use, trackability, and aortic arch support that we believe will further enhance our position in the neurovascular access market. 

The BENCHMARK catheter technology achieves these improvements by combining our advanced tracking technology with the original Neuron intracranial access concept. In addition to improved proximal support in the arch through multi-geometry metal reinforcement, the distal tip is softer and more trackable, while maintaining complete distal shaft radiopacity for improved visualization. The BENCHMARK also is available pre-packaged with a Select catheter to obviate the need for a neurovascular guide catheter exchange, which reduces the number of devices needed per procedure and shortens procedure times. 

Ischemic Stroke 

Penumbra System 

We developed our aspiration-based Penumbra System family of products to enable specialist physicians to revascularize blood vessels that are blocked by clots in the intracranial vasculature. We launched our first Penumbra System product in 2008 in the U. S.. We believe ACE, launched in June 2013, and ACE 64, launched in May 2015, represent significant advancements over prior generations of the Penumbra System. 

Overview of the Penumbra System 

Our Penumbra System family of products is comprised of several principal components, which include: 

&#8226; 

Penumbra Reperfusion Catheters &#32;are the cornerstone of the Penumbra System and are manufactured using a variety of proprietary processes and materials science innovations. We have launched five successive generations of Reperfusion Catheters since 2008. 

&#8226; 

The latest generation of our Reperfusion Catheters, the ACE family of catheters, represents our most powerful and trackable Reperfusion Catheters launched to date. Its design enables specialist physicians to track these large bore aspiration catheters to the distal locations of occluded vessels. Once at the site of the occlusion, ACE provides significantly greater aspiration power than our prior Reperfusion Catheters, which we believe contributes to improved clinical outcomes and reduced procedure times. 

&#8226; 

ACE 64, our latest generation of ACE catheter, is designed to offer enhanced aspiration power relative to prior generations of the product, while maintaining trackability. ACE 64 launched in the U. S. in late May 2015. 

&#8226; 

Penumbra Separators &#32;are a component of the earlier generations of the Penumbra System and enable a physician to remove an aspirated clot that has aggregated in the Reperfusion Catheter during the procedure. The Separators were an important component of our earlier Penumbra System due to the smaller diameter of our original Reperfusion Catheters, which resulted in frequent obstruction of the catheter. With the launch of our larger diameter ACE, Separators are less frequently used by physicians. 

&#8226; 

3D &#32;is a stent retriever component of the Penumbra System that allows a physician to combine direct aspiration with stent retriever technology. 3D is being evaluated in a clinical study pursuant to an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to obtain clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&#38;C Act). With 198 of the anticipated 230 patients enrolled, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for this study recently temporarily suspended further enrollment in order to assess the data. The Board indicated that the suspension was not due to safety issues. 

&#8226; 

Penumbra Aspiration Pumps &#32;are attached to our Reperfusion Catheters and provide the aspirating suction force. Our second generation MAX Aspiration Pump features increased aspiration capabilities and an improved, easier to use design. We have standardized the MAX Aspiration Pump to work with all generations of our Reperfusion Catheters. 

Evolution of Penumbra System&#8217;s Reperfusion Catheters 

The Penumbra System Reperfusion Catheters are the foundation of the Penumbra System. The principal generations of our Reperfusion Catheters include the original Penumbra System, Penumbra System MAX, Penumbra System ACE and Penumbra System ACE 64. We have introduced five successive generations of these catheters since early 2008. Each subsequent generation of our Reperfusion Catheters has incorporated significant performance enhancements relative to prior generations with regard to trackability and aspiration power. 

The Generations of the Penumbra System 

The Original Penumbra System 

Our original Penumbra System was CE-marked in September 2006 and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2007. The Penumbra System is intended for use in the revascularization of patients with ischemic stroke within eight hours of symptom onset. 

Our original Penumbra System was evaluated in the Penumbra Pivotal study, a 125 patient clinical study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System in the revascularization of patients presenting with ischemic stroke. This study was sponsored by Penumbra to support and obtain regulatory clearance for the original Penumbra System. The Penumbra Pivotal study demonstrated an 81.6% success rate in achieving successful revascularization. The study was completed in 2007 and the results were published in the journal Stroke &#32;in 2009. 

We had commissioned and subsequently evaluated the Penumbra System in our THERAPY study, a clinical study comparing the clinical outcomes in the medical management of stroke patients with IV recombinant tPA (rtPA) to stroke patients treated with a combination of IV rtPA and the Penumbra System. The THERAPY study was commenced in March 2012, and was designed to enroll up to 692 patients, but was stopped early in October 2014, because the positive results of the MR CLEAN study made it unethical to continue to treat the control group in the THERAPY study with medical management rather than with endovascular treatment. The MR CLEAN study demonstrated the superiority of endovascular treatment of stroke over medical management. As a result, the steering committee for THERAPY recommended stopping enrollment for the trial. The THERAPY study results, after the randomization of 108 patients, were presented in April 2015 at the European Stroke Organization Conference and the manuscript is being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. Despite the early termination of the study, the pre-specified per protocol analysis demonstrated a significant benefit of combined treatment with IV rtPA and the Penumbra System over IV rtPA alone. 

Penumbra System MAX 

The Penumbra System MAX applies our advanced tracking technology and improved aspiration power to the Penumbra System&#8217;s aspiration platform. Launched in 2011, the 3MAX and 4MAX Systems feature MAX Tracking Technology that allows access over a solo guidewire for an even faster, easier procedure than with our original Penumbra System. The proximal shaft of these specialized catheters incorporates tapering, larger diameters, enabling increased aspiration power. In August 2012, we launched the 5MAX, which added our MAX Tracking Technology to an even larger dimension Reperfusion Catheter. 

ACE 

Almost a decade of research and product development culminated in the introduction of our first ACE Reperfusion Catheter in July 2013. ACE features a unique tapered design, large lumen diameter and other developments that result in significantly greater aspiration power and improved trackability compared to our earlier original Penumbra System and Penumbra MAX products. 

Given its improved aspiration power and larger lumen size, our ACE Reperfusion Catheter can enable the extraction of a fibrous thrombus without fragmentation and often in one solid piece. This leaves the longitudinal fibrin strands in the clot intact, allowing the thrombus to retain its integrity. We believe this is evidenced in our post-launch clinical experience, in which clinicians have seen high rates of TICI 3 revascularization, representing complete recanalization of the affected area, using our ACE catheters. 

Our ACE 64 Reperfusion Catheter was launched in the U. S. in May 2015. It is built on our ACE platform and offers an increased lumen diameter, which leads to further increased aspiration power and which we believe will aid in the removal of clot from the neurovasculature. 

Neurovascular Embolization 

Given the minimal product differentiation among the existing coils on the market, we concluded that to initially penetrate this market successfully we would have to develop a coil that was materially easier to deliver, and provided a procedural economic advantage. We also identified a segment of aneurysms that traditional neurovascular coils could not effectively treat on a cost effective basis. These included larger aneurysms and other larger, more complex lesions. We estimate that these aneurysms and lesions currently represent less than 10% of the addressable aneurysms. 

&#160; The Penumbra Coil 400 

We developed our Penumbra Coil 400 to offer an improved alternative for the treatment of larger aneurysms and other larger, more complex lesions. We implemented several proprietary design innovations to enable the coil to maintain shape while achieving biomechanically stable occlusion. Our coil system is composed of a platinum embolization coil complemented by a nitinol inner structure and stretch resistant nitinol wire. It is attached to a composite delivery pusher with a radiopaque positioning marker. The Penumbra Detachment Handle offers instant mechanical detachment of the coil and can be controlled by the physician in the sterile field. 

We received 510(k) clearance for the Penumbra Coil 400 in 2011. The Penumbra Coil system is FDA cleared for endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms and other neurovascular abnormalities. 

&#160; 

Review of Penumbra Coil 400 Clinical Performance 

Given the size and handling of the Penumbra Coil 400, it is able to achieve higher packing density with fewer coils compared to competitive coiling systems. These findings have been confirmed in numerous physician sponsored post-marketing studies. Collectively, the clinical studies have shown that use of the Penumbra Coil 400 resulted in: 

&#8226; 

less retreatments or worsening occlusions; 

&#8226; 

larger aneurysm treatment capabilities; 

&#8226; 

higher packing density; and 

&#8226; 

fewer coils per aneurysm. 

Penumbra SMART Coil 

Leveraging our initial experience treating larger aneurysms and more complex lesions with the Penumbra Coil 400, we turned our efforts to developing a standard sized coil to compete in the traditional, smaller neurovascular coil market. While the market has seen significant growth over the last 15 years, there has been very little innovation in the last several years with regard to coil design, material science and performance. As a result, neurovascular coils built on the traditional, smaller-coil platform offer very little differentiation in terms of materials, ease-of-use and trackability. 

In light of these dynamics, we focused our development efforts on a coil that would improve ease of delivery, or &#8220;feel&#8221; of the coil compared to the leading established coils. In order to accomplish this, our engineering team developed a highly sophisticated coil that dramatically changes its softness profile within the span of a single individual coil. This progressive softness feature enables physicians to pack the coil into a delicate lesion and mitigate catheter kick-back at the end of delivery, which can preclude the successful complete embolization of the lesion. 

The Penumbra SMART Coil is designed to treat patients with a wide range of neurovascular lesions, including the small and medium sized aneurysms that comprise the majority of the neurovascular coiling market. Alternative products available to physicians in this market are offered in single levels of softness - standard, soft or extra soft. 

The three principal levels of softness that competitors offer are derived from using smaller platinum filaments to increase the level of softness. However, this methodology does not allow for changes to the softness level within an individual coil. The design of the Penumbra SMART Coil allows the level of softness to be determined not only by the diameter of the platinum filament, but also by a structural component inside the coil itself. This development enables the Penumbra SMART Coil to become progressively softer within the span of an individual coil. 

We introduced our SMART Coil in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe that it will provide us with another important opportunity to offer specialist physicians a broader suite of products to address their neurovascular coiling needs. 

Neurosurgical Tools 

The Apollo System 

We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our first neurosurgical product, the Apollo System, in 2014. The Apollo system leverages our expertise in thrombectomy and access to offer a minimally invasive approach to surgical removal of fluid and tissue from the ventricles in the brain. 

The Apollo system is comprised of two primary components: 

&#8226; 

the Apollo wand that is inserted into the brain through an endoscope, which, in turn, is inserted through a small burr hole into the skull; and 

&#8226; 

a reusable hardware device that delivers vacuum, irrigation and vibrational energy along the disposable wand to the site of the hemorrhage. 

OUR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR PRODUCTS 

After initially focusing our business on our neuro products, we identified the peripheral vascular market as an ideal opportunity to leverage our neuro experience and our core expertise in thrombectomy, embolization and access technologies to develop new products that could address significant clinical needs cost effectively. 

The peripheral vasculature suffers from disorders that are very similar to those experienced in the neurovasculature that our products already successfully address. For example, weakening of the vascular walls can result in aneurysms, and blockages can form as the result of embolism or advanced atherosclerosis. Just as the disruption of blood flow to the brain has high mortality and morbidity, disruptions in the peripheral vasculature can also have serious adverse consequences. 

The peripheral vasculature also presents unique challenges that do not apply to interventional efforts in the brain. Many peripheral arteries and veins are significantly larger than those found in the brain and therefore have higher blood flow rates. More importantly, they must be able to accommodate larger pressure gradients and sustain structural integrity despite substantial movement and flexing of the organs and musculature that surround them. Imaging can also be more challenging as physicians have to view their equipment through many more layers of organs and tissue than in the brain. 

In 2012, we began investing further in research and development to evaluate and identify potential solutions to address significant clinical needs in the peripheral vasculature. Our products for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease focus on: 

&#8226; 

peripheral vascular embolization; 

&#8226; 

vessel occlusion; and 

&#8226; 

peripheral vascular thrombectomy. 

Peripheral Embolization 

Ruby Coil System 

After completing research and development focusing on the specific requirements of the peripheral embolization market, we launched our Ruby Coil System for use in the peripheral vascular market in 2013. The Ruby Coil System consists of detachable coils that are specifically designed for peripheral applications. The Ruby coils have a controlled mechanical detachment mechanism that permits the physician to deliver and reposition the coil until the final satisfactory position is reached before detachment. Compared to pushable coils, this minimizes costly complications like embolizing unintended vessels. 

The Ruby Coil System is used in a variety of clinical applications, including: 

&#8226; 

active extravasations, or the escape of blood into surrounding tissue; 

&#8226; 

selective embolization in patients with visceral aneurysms; 

&#8226; 

exclusion of branches prior to chemoembolization and radioembolization; 

&#8226; 

embolization in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding; 

&#8226; 

embolization of branches prior to stent graft procedures; 

&#8226; 

procedures after stent grafting in patients with persistent type II endoleaks and sac enlargement; 

&#8226; 

treatment of patients with varicocele and pelvic congestion syndrome; 

&#8226; 

high flow arterial venous malformations; 

&#8226; 

post trans intrahepatic shunt placement; 

&#8226; 

balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration; and 

&#8226; 

exclusion of hepatic branches prior to liver resection. 

We believe our Ruby Coil System offers specialist physicians a differentiated, cost-effective solution in the treatment of peripheral embolization patients. 

Lantern 

After entering the peripheral embolization market, we developed the Lantern Microcatheter to address unmet clinical needs. We received 510(k) clearance for the Lantern Microcatheter in December 2015. The Lantern Microcatheter is offered in a variety of lengths and tip shapes relevant to peripheral vascular procedures. The distal segment of Lantern is visual under fluoroscopy to aid in the navigation and visualization of the microcatheter during procedures. 

POD (Penumbra Occlusion Device) 

We developed POD, our peripheral vascular occlusion device, to address a specific need in the peripheral embolization market to rapidly and precisely occlude a target vessel. Current options for vessel occlusion in the periphery are limited, either requiring multiple devices or difficult to deliver vascular plugs. Microcatheter deliverable devices, such as coils, are not ideally suited for vessel embolization due to their tendency to migrate with antegrade flow and generally require the deployment of several devices to achieve occlusion. Vascular plug technology for larger peripheral vessels requires access with large diagnostic catheters or even larger bore sheaths. Additionally, these devices often require the placement of adjunctive devices, such as coils, to achieve complete occlusion. Our POD device utilizes technology that delivers both variable sizing and variable softness to provide a single device solution for rapid and precise embolization of the target vessel. We received 510(k) clearance for POD in July 2014. 

Unlike conventional vascular plugs, our POD technology enables the occlusive device to be delivered through a microcatheter. Additionally, a single POD can occlude a range of vessel diameters, reducing the need for sophisticated measurement prior to embolization. 

Our POD technology leverages the key features of a dedicated vessel embolization device to improve ease-of-use. These include: 

&#8226; 

microcatheter deliverability; 

&#8226; 

instant detachment; 

&#8226; 

immediate and precise anchoring; 

&#8226; 

a single device to treat a range of vessel diameters; and 

&#8226; 

dense occlusion in a short segment. 

The technology achieves this range of features through the design of a distal anchoring segment, thereby immediately anchoring the device in a range of vessel diameters. The proximal segment of the POD achieves dense occlusion by packing a softer, smaller diameter segment tightly behind the anchored portion. Once POD is deployed, it can be detached instantly with the sterile detachment handle. 

POD Packing Coil 

We introduced the POD Packing Coil in January 2016 as a complementary device for use with our other peripheral embolization products. It is uniquely designed to pack densely behind RUBY Coils and POD to occlude arteries and veins throughout the peripheral vasculature including aneurysms. 

Peripheral Thrombectomy 

Indigo System 

Our Indigo System, which we launched in 2014, was designed for continuous aspiration mechanical thrombectomy (CAT), leveraging the success of the Penumbra System in ischemic stroke. The Indigo System is designed to remove clots in the peripheral arteries and veins. 

Our Indigo System family of products and accessories is an easy to use thrombectomy system that is powerful, highly trackable, and suited to a wide range of clot morphology. The principal components include: 

&#8226; 

Continuous Aspiration Mechanical Thrombectomy Catheters &#32;are the foundation of the system and are ideally suited to reach anatomy below the knee. Much like our MAX and ACE catheters, the CAT catheters are robust, durable, trackable and suited for the peripheral anatomy. The initial launch of the Indigo System included our CAT5 catheter and the device made for more distal access, CAT3, which is able to reach the distal peripheral vessels of the upper and lower extremities. On May 26, 2015, we received FDA clearance for CAT6 and CAT8, two larger sizes of the Indigo System, as well as to market the Indigo System for use in both the peripheral arterial and venous systems. 

&#8226; 

Indigo Separator &#32;enables the peripheral interventionalist to remove a difficult to aspirate clot from the CAT catheter. In the peripheral vessels, clots often form in long segments, and are more resistant to traditional aspiration techniques. The Indigo System with the Separator enables a wide range of clot morphology to be removed from the body. While conclusions should not be drawn from initial results and further results may prove to be worse or inconclusive, we have demonstrated in clinical settings that the Indigo System with the Separator can remove clots that were resistant to hours of revascularization attempts with other technologies and thrombolytic agents. 

&#8226; 

Penumbra Aspiration Pump &#32;is the power source that provides the aspirating suction force to remove waste, such as blood and clots. 

Research and Development 

We direct our research efforts towards the development of clinical therapies that expand the therapeutic alternatives available to specialist physicians and improve upon our existing product offerings. Our research and development team has a track record of product innovation and significant product improvements. Since inception, we have introduced 16 products brands in either the U. S., international markets, or both. Our research and development expenses totaled $18.0 million , $15.6 million &#32;and $14.1 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We believe our ability to rapidly develop innovative products is in large part attributable to the fully integrated product innovation process that we have implemented, and the management philosophy behind that process. In addition, we have recruited and retained engineers with both significant experience in the development of medical devices as well as engineers directly from undergraduate and graduate programs that have become immediately productive within our development process. We have a pipeline of products in various stages of development that are expected to provide additional commercial opportunities. All of our research and development efforts are based at our campus in Alameda, California. 

Manufacturing 

We currently maintain one manufacturing facility at our campus in Alameda, California, which, together with our research and development space, totals 180,000 square feet. The manufacturing facilities run two eight-hour shifts per weekday. In addition, in December 2015, we signed a lease for an additional 99,568 square feet of space at our campus in Alameda, giving us capacity to increase production, and allowing us to expand adjacent to our current facilities. We currently produce substantially all of our products in-house. 

Our rigorous quality control management programs have earned us a number of quality-related manufacturing designations. Our manufacturing facilities are EN ISO 13485 compliant with ISO 13485-2003 certification achieved in 2005. In 2007, we achieved compliance with MDD standards, allowing our products to be CE marked. We use annual internal audits, combined with external audits by regulatory agencies to help ensure strong quality control practices. An internal, on-going staff training and education program contributes to our quality assurance program; training is documented and considered part of the employee evaluation process. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have dedicated substantial resources to establish a direct sales capability in the U. S., most of Europe, Canada and Australia, which we have complemented with distributors in Japan and certain other international markets. We have regulatory clearance to sell our neurovascular access, ischemic stroke, neurovascular embolization, peripheral embolization and peripheral thrombectomy products in two of our three major markets, the U. S. and Europe, except that 3D has been cleared in Europe but not the U. S. In our third major market, Japan, we have regulatory clearance to sell our ischemic stroke, neurovascular embolization and peripheral embolization products. The only access product that has received regulatory clearance in Japan is PXSLIM. 3D, Ruby Coil, ACE 64 and Indigo System have not received regulatory clearance in Japan. Our Penumbra Coil 400 products are also used for peripheral embolization in Japan, and have received regulatory clearance for that use in that market. Liberty Stent has not yet received regulatory clearance anywhere. We believe our global presence enables us to capitalize on the markets for neuro and peripheral vascular devices that exist outside of the U. S. 

We currently sell our products to hospitals in the U. S. through our dedicated salesforce in two target end markets, neuro and peripheral vascular. Our sales representatives and sales managers generally have substantial medical device experience and market our products directly to a variety of specialist physicians engaged in the treatment of neurovascular and peripheral vascular disorders, who are the end users of our products and significantly influence hospital buying decisions relating to medical devices. We are focused on developing strong relationships with specialist physicians and devote significant resources to training and educating physicians in the use and benefits of our products. The principal specialist physicians in our two target end markets include: 

&#8226; 

Neuro: &#32;Interventional neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons and interventional neurologists. 

&#8226; 

Peripheral vascular: &#32;Interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. 

In addition to our direct sales organizations, we work with distributors in certain geographic areas where we have determined that selling through distributors is likely to be more effective. The largest market where we sell our products through a distributor is Japan, with Medico&#8217;s Hirata Inc. 

Our direct sales have been, and we anticipate will continue to represent, a majority of our revenues. In 2015, direct sales accounted for approximately 83.7% of our revenue, with the balance generated by independent distributors that sell our products outside of the U. S. 

Backlog 

We typically accept and ship orders on the day purchase orders are received or the next business day. Furthermore, if requested, we generally permit customers to cancel or reschedule without penalty. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is material, nor is it a reliable indication of future revenue. 

Reimbursement 

In the U. S., hospitals are the purchasers of our products. Hospitals in turn bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, for the total healthcare services required to treat the patient. Government agencies, private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and to reimburse hospitals for inpatient treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis-related group (DRG) as determined by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed, and is unrelated to the specific medical device used in that procedure. Medicare rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, most look to coverage and payment by Medicare as a benchmark by which to make their own decisions. 

Some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary, not cost-effective, or used for a non-approved indication. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. 

&#160; 

Outside the U. S., market acceptance of medical devices depends partly upon the availability of reimbursement within the prevailing healthcare payment system. Reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. A small number of countries may require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so. 

The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U. S. and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in international markets will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, medical device reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under healthcare payment systems in such markets. 

All third-party reimbursement programs, whether government funded or insured commercially, whether in the U. S. or internationally, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, second opinions required prior to major surgery, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. These types of programs and legislative or regulatory changes to reimbursement policies could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. 

Competition 

The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of neurovascular and peripheral vascular medical devices. Our most notable competitors are Boston Scientific, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Medtronic, Stryker and Terumo. All of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with a number of smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have: 

&#8226; 

significantly greater name recognition; 

&#8226; 

broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors; 

&#8226; 

more established distribution networks; 

&#8226; 

additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage; 

&#8226; 

greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and 

&#8226; 

greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation. 

We compete primarily on the basis that our products are able to treat patients with neurovascular and peripheral vascular diseases and disorders safely and effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to: 

&#8226; 

develop innovative, proprietary products that can cost-effectively address significant clinical needs; 

&#8226; 

continue to innovate and develop scientifically advanced technology; 

&#8226; 

obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals; 

&#8226; 

demonstrate efficacy in Penumbra-sponsored and third-party clinical trials and studies; 

&#8226; 

apply technology across product lines and markets; 

&#8226; 

attract and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and 

&#8226; 

cost-effectively manufacture and successfully market and sell products. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property and operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We do not have any material licenses to any technology or intellectual property rights. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 20 issued patents globally, of which nine were U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 38 pending patent applications, of which 15 were patent applications pending in the U. S. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, nine of our issued patents are currently expected to expire between 

2024 and 2025; five of these patents relate to components of the Penumbra System and the Indigo System and one of these patents relates to methods performed by the Apollo System. An additional five of our issued patents, which relate to components of devices that have not been commercialized, are expected to expire between 2026 and 2027. The remaining seven of our issued patents, which relate to the components of the Penumbra Coil 400 and Ruby Coil, are currently expected to expire after 2027. Our issued patents relate to the following main areas: mechanical thrombectomy, coil embolization, treatment of aneurysm and treatment of intracranial hemorrhage. Our pending patent applications relate primarily to the following five main areas: mechanical thrombectomy, coil embolization, coronary atherectomy, blood filtration and treatment of patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Some of our pending patent applications pertain to components and methods of use associated with currently commercialized products. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products or provide us with any competitive advantage. See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property&#8221; for additional information. 

Additionally, we own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that are used in our business and in conjunction with the sale of our products, including nine U.S. trademark registrations and six foreign trademark registrations as of December 31, 2015 . Included in the registered trademarks is a mark with our company name and logo. 

We also seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. 

Government Regulation 

United States 

Our products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the FD&#38;C Act and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U. S. and comparable authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of Warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 

Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U. S. will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a premarket approval from the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD&#38;C Act, such as provisions that relate to adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FD&#38;C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA., Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the U. S. unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a premarket approval application ( PMA ). However, there are some Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a premarket notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner. 

510(k) Clearance Pathway 

When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same 

intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the premarket notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III. 

There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt. 

Premarket Approval Pathway 

A premarket approval application must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The premarket approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A premarket approval application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device. 

After a premarket approval application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed premarket approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel&#8217;s recommendations are important to the FDA&#8217;s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation ( QSR) . The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA&#8217;s regulations. 

Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA&#8217;s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA&#8217;s review clock is reset. 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support premarket approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the U. S., for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption( IDE) &#32;to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA&#8217;s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 

Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. 

Ongoing Regulation by the FDA 

Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#8226; 

establishment registration and device listing; 

&#8226; 

the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#8226; 

labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities; 

&#8226; 

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 

&#8226; 

corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&#38;C Act that may present a risk to health; and 

&#8226; 

post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties. 

Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs. 

FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services ( CDHS) &#32;requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular QSR inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions: 

&#8226; 

warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

&#8226; 

customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 

&#8226; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

&#8226; 

delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products; 

&#8226; 

withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and 

&#8226; 

criminal prosecution. 

The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or 

serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 

Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development. 

We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory, and manufacturing practices. 

Regulatory Inspections 

We are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured, and clinical trials sponsored, by us. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or Form FDA 483. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA following an inspection, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions or other actions in order to address the FDA&#8217;s concerns. Failure to address the FDA&#8217;s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions. 

From June 24, 2015 to July 15, 2015, the FDA conducted an inspection of our records relating to certain investigational sites for two different clinical trials, and from July 30, 2015 to August 4, 2015, the FDA conducted an inspection of our Quality System. At the conclusion of the first inspection, a Form FDA 483 was issued with one observation related to the failure to ensure proper monitoring at five of the investigational sites reviewed. At the conclusion of the second inspection, a Form FDA 483 was also issued with one observation relating to our procedures for completing and documenting effectiveness checks for Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA). We provided timely responses to both Form FDA 483s, implemented changes to our clinical trial monitoring and CAPA procedures, and updated the FDA on the steps taken. On November 6, 2015, we received a letter from the FDA regarding the CAPA-related Form 483, noting that they had received our responses and would review the adequacy of the actions taken at our next inspection. On December 21, 2015, we received a letter from the FDA regarding the monitoring-related Form 483 indicating that our responses and actions appeared adequate to address the observation and noting that they may verify the actions taken during a future inspection. However, the FDA may conclude in subsequent inspections that we have not adequately responded to its observations or carried out all necessary corrective actions, and could take action against us without further notice. Action by the FDA against us could result in monetary fines or require us to take further corrective actions, which could be expensive and time-consuming to complete and could impose additional burdens and expenses, and could even require us to discontinue our investigational studies. 

European Union 

Our products are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the European Union Directive (93/42/EEC), also known as the Medical Device Directive. An authorized third party, also called a Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance to the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard. 

Other Regions 

Most major markets have different levels of regulatory requirements for medical devices. Modifications to the cleared or approved products may require a new regulatory submission in all major markets. The regulatory requirements, and the review time, vary significantly from country to country. Products can also be marketed in other countries that have minimal requirements for medical devices. 

Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation 

Anti-Kickback Statute 

We are subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under 

federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. 

There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the anti-kickback statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. 

Federal Civil False Claims Act. &#32;The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as &#8220; qui tam &#8221; actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as &#8220;relators&#8221; or, more commonly, as &#8220;whistleblowers,&#8221; may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam &#32;actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. 

Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute. &#32;The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

Sunshine Act. &#32;The Affordable Care Act also included a provision, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act. This provision requires that any manufacturer of a covered device that provides payment or other transfer of value to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the request of a physician or teaching hospital, must submit to CMS information about the payment or other transfer of value annually, with the reported information to be made public on a searchable website. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. &#32;The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included an expansion of HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Among other things, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state 

attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 1,100 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good. 

Facilities 

We maintain a 180,000 square feet research and development and manufacturing facility in three buildings at our campus in Alameda, California. The leases for these three buildings expire in 2029, subject to our option to renew any or all three leases for an additional ten years. In December 2015, we signed a lease for an additional 99,568 square feet of space (plus an additional space of 15,882 square feet that may be delivered to us at the landlord&#8217;s option prior to May 1, 2016) in three adjacent buildings located in our campus in Alameda, California. From time to time during the ten year period following the initial commencement date of the new lease, if any space in any of the buildings or in a fourth building located in the same business park as our campus becomes vacant, that space will be added to the lease at the then current base monthly rental rate. The maximum additional space that could be added under this provision of the lease is 117,325 square feet. We have a right of first offer to lease any space that becomes available in the buildings or in the fourth building after the expiration of the ten year period following the initial commencement date, subject to the terms described in the new lease. The term of the new lease expires after fifteen years from the initial lease commencement date, subject to our option to renew the lease for up to three additional five-year periods. 

We also lease office space in Berlin, Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The offices in Berlin and Sydney support our direct sales operations in Europe and Australia, respectively, and the office in Sao Paulo supports our Latin America marketing efforts through our distribution partners. 

Legal Proceedings 

We were contacted in 2015 by the attorney for a potential product liability claimant who allegedly suffered injuries as a result of an aneurysm procedure in which the Penumbra Coil 400 was used. On February 19, 2016, a complaint for damages was filed on behalf of this claimant against Penumbra and the hospital involved in the procedure ( Montgomery v. Penumbra, Inc., et al., &#32;Case No. 16-2-04050-1 SEA, Superior Court of the State of Washington, King County) . The suit alleges liability primarily under the Washington Product Liability Act and seeks both compensatory and punitive damages without a specific damages claim. Counsel for the claimant previously indicated that he expects that a jury could award $35 million in damages were this matter to go to trial. This amount is substantially in excess of our insurance coverage. The hospital defendant has requested indemnification from Penumbra. As the litigation has been filed recently and the parties have not engaged in formal discovery, we are unable to assess the merits of the plaintiff&#8217;s case. We intend to vigorously defend the litigation, as we believe there will be substantial questions regarding causation, liability and damages. 

Additionally, from time to time, we are subject to claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation matter that, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
