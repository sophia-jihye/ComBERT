Products and programs are marketed primarily through field sales employees and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. 

We believe that our Textile Care business is one of the leading suppliers world-wide in the laundry markets in which we compete. 

Global Institutional 

&#160; 

This reportable segment consists of the Institutional, Specialty and Healthcare operating units. It provides specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lod ging, healthcare, government, education and retail industries. The underlying operating units exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the three operating units which comprise our Global Institutional segment follows below. 

&#160; 

Institutional 

&#160; 

Our Institutional business sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (&#8220;warewashing&#8221;), plus specialized cleaners for various applications thr oughout food service operations; for on- premise laundries (typically used by hotel and healthcare customers) ; and for general housekeeping functions, as well as food safety products and equipment, water filters, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries. Institutional also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers, as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality, healthcare and commercial facilities. Institutional develops various chemical dispensing systems which are used by our customers to efficiently and safely dispense our cleaners and sanitizers. In addition, the Institutional operating unit markets a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Through our EcoSure Food Safety Management business, Institutional also provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice operations. 

&#160; 

Institutional sells its products and programs primarily through Company- employed field sales personnel. In addition, corporate account sales personnel establish relationships and negotiate contracts with larger mu lti-unit or &#8220;chain&#8221; customers. We also utilize independent, third-party foodservice, broad-line and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers for accounts that prefer to purchase through these distributors. Many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers. Through our Company-employed field sales and service personnel, we generally provide the same customer support to end-use customers supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are the leading global supplier of warewashing and laundry products and programs to the food service and hospitality markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Specialty 

&#160; 

Our Specialty operating unit supplies cleaning and sanitizing chemical products and related items primarily to regional, national and international quick service restaurant (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) chains and food retailers (i.e., sup ermarkets and grocery stores). Its products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and equipment which are primarily sold under the &#8220; Kay&#8221; and &#8220;Ecolab&#8221; brand names. Specialty&#8217;s cleaning and sanitation programs are customized to meet the needs of the market segments it serves and are designed to provide highly effective cleaning performance, promote food safety, reduce labor costs and enhance user and guest safety. A number of dispensing options are available for products in the core product range. Specialty supports its product sales with employee training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers. 

&#160; 

Both Specialty&#8217;s QSR business and its food retail business utilize a corporate account sales force which establishes relationships and negotiates contracts with customers at the corporate headquarters and regional office levels (and, in the QSR market segment, at the franchisee level) and a field sales force which provides program support at the individ ual restaurant or store level. Customers in the QSR market segment are primarily supplied through third party distributors while most food retail customers utilize their own distribution networks. While Specialty&#8217;s customer base has grown over the years, Specialty&#8217;s business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of major QSR chains and franchisees and large food retail customers. 

&#160; 

We believe that Specialty is the leading supplier of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global QSR market and a leading supplier of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global food retail market. 

&#160;

Other 

&#160; 

Other consists of the Pest Elimination and Equipment Care operating units. It provides pest elimination and kitchen repair and maintenance, with its two operating units that are primari ly fee-for-service businesses. In general, these businesses provide service which can augment or extend our product offerings to our business customers as a part of our &#8220;Circle the Customer&#8221; approach and, in particular, by enhancing our food safety capabilities. 

&#160; 

Pest Elimination 

&#160; 

Pest Elimination provides services designed to detect, eliminate and prevent pests, such as rodents and insects, in restaurants, food and beverage processors, educational and healthcare facilities, hotels, quick service restaurant and grocery operations and other instituti onal and commercial customers. The services of Pest Elimination are sold and performed by Company-employed field sales and service personnel. 

&#160; 

Our Pest Elimination business continues to e xpand its geographic coverage. In addition to the United States, which constitutes the largest operation, we operate this business in various countries in Asia Pacific, Western Europe, Latin America and South Africa, with the largest operations in France, the United Kingdom, Greater China and Brazil. 

We believe Pest Elimination is one of the leading suppliers of pest elimination programs to the commercial, hospitality and institution al markets in the geographies it serve s . 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Equipment Care business provides equipment repair, maintenance and preventive maintenance services for the co mmercial food service industry. Repair services are offered for in-warranty repair, acting as the manufacturer&#8217;s authorized service agent, as well as after-warranty repair. In addition, Equipment Care operates as a parts distributor to repair service companies and end-use customers. At this time, the Equipment Care business operates solely in the United States. 

&#160; 

We believe that Equipment Care is a leading provider of equipment maintenance and repair programs to the commercial food service industry in the United States locations in which we compete. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Additional Information 

&#160; 

International Operations &#160; 

&#160; 

We directly operate in approximately 90 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in some cases, through a join t venture with a local partner. In certain countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. In general, our businesses conducted outside the United States are similar to those conducted in the United States. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our business operations outside the United States are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, international business laws and regulations, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic an d political conditions. The profitability of our International operations has historically been lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States, due to (i) the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions, (ii) higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions, (iii) the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size , and (iv) the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins. Proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations. 

&#160; 

Competitio n 

&#160; 

In general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, chemical formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring services, and dosing and metering equipment. 

&#160; 

The businesses in our Global Institutional and Other segments have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation. 

&#160; 

Our Global Energy segment competes with a limited number of multinational companies, with the remainder of the market comprised of smaller, regional niche companies focused on limited geographic areas. We compete in this business on the basis of our product and service quality, technical expertise, chemical formulations and emphasis on safety and environmental leadership. 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

Products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by Company-trained field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatme nt and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors are utilized in several markets, as described in the business unit descriptions found above. 

&#160; 

Number of Employees 

&#160; 

We had approximately 47,000 employees as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Customers and Classes of Products 

&#160; 

We believe that our business is not materially dependent upon a s ingle customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our 2015 consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit. 

We sold one class of products within the Global Institutional segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in two of the last three years. Sales of warewashing products were approximately 10% of consolidated net sales in both 2015 and 2013. 

&#160; 

Patents and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We own and license a number of patents, trademarks an d other intellectual property. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by f iling for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark except patents related to our TRASAR and 3D TRASAR technology, which are material to our Water and Paper segments, and trademarks related to Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR. The Ecolab trademarks are material to the Global Industrial, Global Institutional and Other segments and the Nalco trademarks are material to the Water, Paper and Energy businesses. The 3D TRASAR trademarks predominantly relate to our Water and Paper segments. U.S. and foreign patents protect aspects of our key TRASAR and 3D TRASAR technology until at least 2024. The Ecolab, Nalco Company and 3D TRASAR trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets, and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

We experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments. Part II, Item 8, Note 18 , entitled &#8220;Quarterly Financial Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

Investments in Equipment 

&#160; 

We have no unusual working capital requirements. We have invested in the past, and will continue to invest in the future, in process control and monitoring equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems. The investment in such equipment is discussed under the heading "Investing Activities" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K . 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-operated manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third -party contract manufacturers. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. &#8220;Properties,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Deliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and third-party logistics service providers. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors for transport. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. &#8220;Properties,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Raw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis, acids, biocides, phosphonates, phosphorous materials, silicates and salts; and organic chemicals, including acids, alcohols, amines, fatty acids, surfactants, solvents, monomers and polymers. Healthcare purchases plastic films and parts to manufacture medical devices that serve the surgical and infection prevention markets. Pesticides used by our Pest Elimination business are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. We purchase more than 10,000 raw materials, with the largest single raw material representing less than 2% of raw material purchases. Our raw materials, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs at globally competitive levels. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of existing ones, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, process and packaging engineering, remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, developm ent and engineering personnel. At times, technology has also been licensed from third parties to develop offerings. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers. 

&#160; 

Part II, Item 8, Note 14, entitled &#8220;Research an d Development Expenditures&#8221; of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

Joint Ventures 

&#160; 

Over time, certain of our business units have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. In particular, our Energy and Water businesses are parties to numerous joint ventures, though many of our other business units also conduct some bu siness through joint ventures. During 2015, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was less than two percent . The table below identifies our most significant consolidated and non-consolidated joint ventures, summarized by the primary purpose of the joint venture.

This joint venture was included among the Venezuelan subsidiaries that we deconsolidated for U.S. GAAP purposes effective at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, as further described within the MD&#38;A and Part II, Item 8, Note 3 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations 

&#160; 

Our businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks ar e inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean &#8209;up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air pollution regulations and regulations relating to oil and gas production (including those related to hydraulic fracturing), could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Additionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below. 

&#160; 

Ingredient Legislation : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by certain states, including California, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and South Carolina. Environmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in nine states to date, and in recent years have been considered by sev eral other state legislatures. Cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress in each of the past few years but has not passed, and several states including California and New York are considering fur ther regulations in this area. The California Safer Consumer Products Act regulations became effective in 2013 and focus on ingredients in consumer products that have the potential for widespread public exposure. The U.S. Government is monitoring &#8220;green chemistry&#8221; initiatives through a variety of initiatives, including its &#8220;Design for the Environment&#8221; (&#8220;DfE&#8221;)/&#8221;Safer Choice&#8221; program. DfE/Safer Choice has three broad areas of work (recognition of safer products on a DfE/Safer Choice label, development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals), and we are involved in these to varying degrees. Our Global Institutional and Global Industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stay-in-market expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformula tion or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date. 

&#160; 

TSCA : Re-authorization of the Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;) and an update of the chemicals on the TSCA Inventory (the so-called &#8220;reset&#8221; of the TSCA Inventory) were passed by both chambers of t he U.S. Congress, and final enactment of legislation is likely to occur in the first half of 2016. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) also is more aggressively using the existing TSCA tools to manage chemicals of concern. We anticipate that compliance with new requirements under TSCA could be similar to the costs associated with REACH in the European Union, which is discussed below. 

&#160; 

REACH : The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (&#8220;REACH&#8221;). It established a new European Chemicals Agency (&#8220;ECHA&#8221;) in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. We met the pre-registration requirements of REACH, the 2010 and 2013 registration deadlines, and are on track to meet the upcoming registration deadlines and requirements in 2018. To help manage this program, we have been simplifying our product line s and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. In addition, Korea, Taiwan and other countries are planning similar requirements. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable, but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position. 

&#160; 

GHS : In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (&#8220;GHS&#8221;). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels an d safety data sheets (&#8220;SDSs&#8221;). Most countries in which we operate will adopt GHS-related legislation, and numerous countries already have done so. The primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels. We met the 2015 deadlines in the U.S. and European Union and are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate the costs of GHS implementation in other countries. Potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position. 

&#160; 

Pesticide and Biocide Legislation : Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such products constitute &#8220;pesticides&#8221; or &#8220;antimicrobial pesticides&#8221; under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pestic ides. We maintain several hundred product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires reg istration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different f rom those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to 

&#160;

increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position. 

&#160; 

In Europe, the Biocidal Product Directive and the more recent Biocidal Products Regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met the first relevant deadline of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances. Anticipated registration costs, which will be incurred through the multi-year phase-in period, will be significant; however, these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position. 

&#160; 

In addition, our Pest Elimination business applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties. That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements. 

&#160; 

FDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements : Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulatio ns for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA. FDA regulations associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act may impose additional requirements related to safety product lines. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

&#160; 

Medical Device and Drug Product Requirements : As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products. We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device and drug manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Quality System Regulations which require that we have a quality system for the design and production of our products intended for commercial distribution in the United States and satisfy recordkeeping requirements with respect to our manufacturing, t esting and control activities. Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a &#8220;CE mark&#8221;, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Directive 93/42/EE and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical device and medicinal products in Europe. Our other international non-European operations also are subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations. Regulators at the federal, state and local level have imposed, are currently considering and are expected to continue to impose regulations on medi cal devices and drug products. No prediction can be made of the potential effect of any such future regulations, and there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulations will not increase the costs of our products or prohibit the sale or use of certain products. 

&#160; 

Other Environmental Legislation; Capital Expenditures : Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. &#160; The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances i nto the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolab&#8217;s facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmen tal sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $55 million in 2015 and $53 million in 2014. Approximately $ 67 million has been budgeted globally for project s in 2016. The increase in 2016 over 2015 is due to continued spending on process safety matters throughout the Company, including facilities acquired in connection with the Champion transaction. 

&#160; 

Climate Change : Various laws and regulations pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation at the international, national, regional and state levels, particularly as they relate to the reduction of gre enhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions. None of these laws and regulations directly apply to Ecolab at the present time; however, as a matter of corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG 

&#160;

emissions while sustai ning economic growth . We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and have made significant strides in recent years. In 2014, we received a Climate Leadership Award, co-sponsored by EPA, recognizing Ecolab for achieving an absolute global greenhouse gas emissions reduction of more than 12.5 percent (22.4 percent intensity reduction). 

&#160; 

Our current global sustainability targets were established in 2014. They include a 25 percent reduction in effluent discharge and waste, a 20 percent reduction in water use and a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2017. In addition to our internal sustainability performance, we partner with customers at more than 1.3 million customer locations around the world to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions through our high-efficiency solutions in cleaning and sanitation, water, paper and energy services. These actions directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lessening the demand for energy. 

&#160; 

Environmental Remediation and Proceedings : Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (&#8220;PRP&#8221;), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean &#8209;up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) or state equivalents at 23 sites in the United S tates. Additionally, we have similar liability at nine sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. 

&#160; 

Based on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. Unasserted claims are not reflected in the accrual. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes. 

&#160; 

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;) issued a Notice of Enforcement (&#8220;NOE&#8221;) and Notice of Violation (&#8220;NOV&#8221;) related to Ecolab&#8217;s facility in Fresno, TX on August 29, 2014, alleging violations of the facility&#8217;s air permits and various state and federal air laws. We have provided information to the TCEQ regarding the alleged violations and met with them to discuss our response to the NOV and NOE and the corrective actions already implemented. On June 24, 2015, the TCEQ issued a draft consent decree to Ecolab for certain violations, and the TCEQ is now seeking an administrative penalty of approximately $0.9 million. We anticipate that this matter will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

&#160; 

We have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries, but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future , and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures. In each of these chemical exposure cases, our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf (with or without reservation) and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible; however, we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance. 

&#160; 

We have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances, including multi-party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection w ith our products and services. While we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information, there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

&#160; 

Our worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $6.5 million in 2015 and $5.0 million in 2014. Our worldwide accruals at December 31, 2015 for probable future remediation expenditures, excluding potential insurance reimbursements, tota led approximately $26 million. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. &#160;
