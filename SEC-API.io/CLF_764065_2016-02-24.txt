Business 

Introduction 

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. traces its history back to 1847. Today, we are a leading mining and natural resources company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. Additionally, Cliffs operates an iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders with operating and financial transparency. 

We are organized through a global commercial group responsible for sales and delivery of our products and operations groups responsible for the production of the iron ore that we market. Our continuing operations are organized according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. 

In the U.S., we currently own or co-own five &#32;iron ore mines in Michigan and Minnesota. We are currently operating the two iron mines in Michigan and one of the three iron ore mines in Minnesota. Two of our three iron ore operations in Minnesota are temporarily idled due to reductions in iron ore pellet nominations from our customers due to the continued oversupply of steel in the U.S. market as a result of record levels of imported steel which stems from excess supply in the global markets. Our Asia Pacific operations consist solely of our Koolyanobbing iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. 

Also, for the majority of 2015, we operated two metallurgical coal operations in Alabama and West Virginia. In December 2015, we completed the sale of these operations, which marked our exit from the coal business. As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements . As such, all current year and historical North American Coal operating segment results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS &#32;for further discussion of the North American Coal segment discontinued operations. 

Additionally, we continue to own two non-operating iron ore mines in Eastern Canada that are currently in restructuring proceedings in Montreal, Quebec, under the CCAA. The CCAA filing related to our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations is more fully described below in the Business Segments section and in NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS . Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Bloom Lake Group, Wabush Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the "Canadian Entities") are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. 

Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations. 

The Company is Focused on our Core U.S. Iron Ore Business 

We continue to execute the strategy that was established in 2014, which focuses on becoming a company fully centered on our U.S. Iron Ore business. We are the market-leading iron ore producer in the U.S., supplying differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts, some of which begin to expire in December 2016, to the largest North American steel producers. Cliffs has the unique advantage of being a low cost producer of iron ore pellets in the U.S. market with significant transportation and logistics advantages to effectively serve the U.S. steel market. Pricing structures contained in and the long-term supply provided by our existing contracts, along with our low-cost operating profile, positions U.S. Iron Ore as our most stable business. We expect to continue to strengthen our U.S. Iron Ore cost operating profile through continuous operational improvements and disciplined capital allocation policies. Strategically, we continue to develop various entry options into the EAF market. As the EAF steel market continues to grow in the U.S., there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce &#32; direct reduced iron pellets, hot briquetted iron and/or &#32; pig iron. In 2015, we produced and shipped a &#32; batch trial of DR-grade pellets, a source of lower silica iron units for the production of direct reduced &#32; iron pellets. In early 2016, we reached a significant milestone with positive results from the successful industrial &#32; trial of our DR-grade pellets. While we are still in the early stages of developing our alternative metallic business, we believe this will open up a new opportunity for us to diversify our product mix and add new customers to our U.S. Iron Ore segment beyond the traditional blast furnace clientele. 

Business Segments 

Our Company&#8217;s continuing operations are organized and managed according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore. 

Segment information reflects our business units, which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition. We have historically evaluated segment performance based on sales margin, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold, and operating expenses identifiable to each segment. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2014, concurrent with the change in control on July 29, 2014, management began to evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA, defined as EBITDA excluding certain items such as impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, impacts of discontinued operations, extinguishment of debt, severance and contractor termination costs and other costs associated with the change in control, foreign currency remeasurement, certain supplies inventory write-offs, and intersegment corporate allocations of selling, general and administrative costs. Management uses and believes that investors benefit from referring to these measures in evaluating operating and financial results, as well as in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods as these financial measures approximate the cash flows associated with the operational earnings. Financial information about our segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is included in Item 7. &#32; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32; and NOTE 2 - SEGMENT REPORTING &#32;included in Item 8. &#32; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

U.S. Iron Ore 

We are a major producer of iron ore pellets, primarily selling production from U.S. Iron Ore to integrated steel companies in the U.S. and Canada. We manage five &#32;iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. In Michigan, we are currently operating the two iron ore mines, Empire mine and Tilden mine. In Minnesota, we are currently operating one iron ore mine, Hibbing mine. The other two iron ore operations in Minnesota, United Taconite mine and Northshore mine, are temporarily idled due to reduced pellet demand from our customers. The idling of United Taconite mine began during August 2015 and the idling of Northshore mine began at the end of November 2015. Both mines are expected to be idled through at least the first quarter of 2016. The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 32.9 million &#32;tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 56 percent &#32;of total U.S. pellet production capacity. Based on our equity ownership in these mines, our share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 25.5 million &#32;tons, representing 44 percent &#32;of total U.S. annual pellet capacity. 

The following chart summarizes the estimated annual pellet production capacity and percentage of total U.S. pellet production capacity for each of the respective iron ore producers as of December 31, 2015 :

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our U.S. iron ore production generally is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements with various price adjustment provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we produced a total of 26.1 million &#32;tons of iron ore pellets, including 19.3 million &#32;tons for our account and 6.8 million &#32;tons on behalf of steel company partners of the mines. 

We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in our customers&#8217; blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. Additionally, as the EAF steel market continues to grow in the U.S., there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce &#32; direct reduced iron pellets, hot briquetted iron and/or &#32; pig iron. In 2015, we produced and shipped a &#32; batch trial of DR-grade pellets, a source of lower silica iron units for the production of direct reduced &#32; iron pellets. In early 2016, we reached a significant milestone with positive results from the successful industrial &#32; trial of our DR-grade pellets. While we are still in the early stages of developing our alternative metallic business, we believe this will open up a new opportunity for us to diversify our product mix and add new customers to our U.S. Iron Ore segment beyond the traditional blast furnace clientele. 

The variation in grades of iron ore pellets results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. Although the grade or grades of pellets currently delivered to each customer are based on that customer&#8217;s preferences, which depend in part on the characteristics of the customer&#8217;s blast furnace operation, in many cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably. Industry demand for the various grades of iron ore pellets depends on each customer&#8217;s preferences and changes from time to time. In the event that a given mine is operating at full capacity, the terms of most of our pellet supply agreements allow some flexibility in providing our customers iron ore pellets from different mines. 

Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called &#8220;standard&#8221; because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer&#8217;s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace. 

Each of our U.S. Iron Ore mines is located near the Great Lakes. The majority of our iron ore pellets are transported via railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America. 

Our U.S. Iron Ore sales are influenced by seasonal factors in the first quarter of the year as shipments and sales are restricted by the Army Corp of Engineers due to closure of the Soo Locks and the Welland Canal on the Great Lakes. During the first quarter, we continue to produce our products, but we cannot ship those products via lake vessel until the conditions on the Great Lakes are navigable, which causes our first and second quarter inventory levels to rise. Our limited practice of shipping product to ports on the lower Great Lakes or to customers&#8217; facilities prior to the transfer of title has somewhat mitigated the seasonal effect on first and second quarter inventories and sales, as shipment from this point to the customers&#8217; operations is not limited by weather-related shipping constraints. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had approximately 1.3 million &#32;and 1.4 million &#32;tons of pellets, respectively, in inventory at lower lakes or customers&#8217; facilities. 

U.S. Iron Ore Customers 

Our U.S. Iron Ore revenues primarily are derived from sales of iron ore pellets to the North American integrated steel industry, consisting of three major customers, two of which we currently have supply agreements. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we terminated the long term agreement with our third major customer as a result of the continual material breaches. Refer to the Essar &#32;section within Concentration of Customers &#32;below for further information. Generally, we have multi-year supply agreements with our customers. Sales volume under these agreements largely is dependent on customer requirements, and in many cases, we are the sole supplier of iron ore to the customer. Historically, each agreement has contained a base price that is adjusted annually using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that could result in a price adjustment include spot pricing, measures of general industrial inflation and steel prices. Additionally, certain of our supply agreements have a provision that limits the amount of price increase or decrease in any given year. 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 17.3 million , 21.8 million &#32;and 21.3 million &#32;tons of iron ore pellets, respectively, from our share of the production from our U.S. Iron Ore mines. The segment&#8217;s three major customers together accounted for a total of 93 percent , 86 percent &#32;and 78 percent &#32;of U.S. Iron Ore product revenues for the years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Refer to Concentration of Customers &#32;below for additional information regarding our major customers. 

Asia Pacific Iron Ore 

Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of our wholly owned Koolyanobbing operation. 

The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. The variation in the two export product grades reflects the inherent chemical and physical characteristics of the ore bodies mined as well as 

the supply requirements of our customers. Production in 2015 &#32;was 11.7 million metric tons, compared with 11.4 million metric tons in 2014 &#32;and 11.1 million metric tons in 2013 . 

Koolyanobbing is a collective term for the deposits at Koolyanobbing, Mount Jackson and Windarling. There are approximately 70 miles separating the three mining areas. The operations at Windarling have been idled since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of cost cutting measures. Banded iron formations host the mineralization, which is predominately hematite and goethite. Each deposit is characterized with different chemical and physical attributes and, in order to achieve customer product quality, ore in varying quantities from each deposit must be blended together. 

Crushing and blending are undertaken at Koolyanobbing, where the crushing and screening plant is located. Once the blended ore has been crushed and screened into a direct lump and fines shipping product, it is transported by rail approximately 360 miles south to the Port of Esperance, via Kalgoorlie, for shipment to our customers in Asia. 

Asia Pacific Iron Ore Customers 

Asia Pacific Iron Ore&#8217;s production is under contract with steel companies primarily in China, Japan and Korea. In March 2015, we extended the majority of our supply agreements with steel producers in China, and one steel producer in Japan, for two years. The remaining supply agreements with our China steel clients, as well as clients in Japan and Korea, will currently expire in March 2016, but we anticipate that the majority of these contracts will be renewed for the remainder of 2016 in conjunction with our customers&#8217; fiscal year. Pricing for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore Chinese customers consists of shorter-term pricing mechanisms of various durations up to 45 days based on the average of daily spot prices that are generally associated with the time of unloading of each shipment. Pricing with our Japanese and Korean customers is generally consistent with the inputs used with our Chinese customers, but the pricing inputs are fixed before shipment. &#160; 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 11.6 million , 11.5 million &#32;and 11.0 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from our Western Australia mines. No Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer comprised more than 10 percent of Cliffs consolidated sales in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . The segment&#8217;s five largest customers together accounted for a total of 47 percent, 38 percent and 42 percent of Asia Pacific Iron Ore product revenues for the years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

North American Coal 

Throughout the majority of 2015, we owned and operated two &#32;low-volatile metallurgical coal operations located in Alabama and West Virginia. These low-volatile metallurgical coal operations had a rated capacity of 6.5 million tons of production annually. &#32; In the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold these two low-volatile metallurgical coal operations, Pinnacle mine and Oak grove mine, marking our exit from the coal business. The sale was completed on December 22, 2015. In 2015 , we sold a total of 4.6 million tons, compared with 7.4 million &#32;tons in 2014 &#32;and 7.3 million tons in 2013 . &#32;&#32; In the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold our CLCC assets, which consisted of two high-volatile metallurgical coal mines and a thermal coal mine. The sale was completed on December 31, 2014. Sales tons at the CLCC operations were 2.4 million tons and 2.2 million tons for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in the sales tons disclosed above. 

As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements . As such, all current year and historical North American Coal operating segment results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS &#32;for further discussion of the North American Coal segment discontinued operations. 

Eastern Canadian Iron Ore 

We continue to own two iron ore mines in Eastern Canada that are currently in restructuring proceedings in Montreal, Quebec, under the CCAA. 

As disclosed in the first quarter of 2014, at the end of March 2014, we idled our Wabush Scully mine in Newfoundland and Labrador and in November 2014, we began to implement the permanent closure plan for the mine. The idle and ultimate closure was driven by the unsustainable high cost structure. Additionally, we disclosed in November 2014, that we were pursuing exit options for our Bloom Lake mine. As disclosed in January 2015, active production at the Bloom Lake mine had ceased and the mine had transitioned to "care-and-maintenance" mode. Together, the shutdown of the Wabush Scully mine and the cessation of operations at our Bloom Lake mine represented a complete curtailment of our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations. 

During 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we sold 7.2 million and 8.6 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate and pellets, respectively, from our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore mines. 

As more fully described in NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS , in January 2015, we announced that the Bloom Lake Group commenced restructuring proceedings in Montreal, Quebec under the CCAA. At that time, we had recently suspended Bloom Lake operations and for several months had been exploring options to sell certain of our Canadian assets, among other initiatives. Effective January 27, 2015, following the CCAA filing of the Bloom Lake Group, we deconsolidated the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries comprising substantially all of our Canadian operations. Additionally, on May 20, 2015, the Wabush Group commenced restructuring proceedings in Montreal, Quebec under the CCAA which resulted in the deconsolidation of the remaining Wabush Group entities that were not previously deconsolidated. The Wabush Group was no longer generating revenues and was not able to meet its obligations as they came due. As a result of this action, the CCAA protections granted to the Bloom Lake Group were extended to include the Wabush Group to facilitate the reorganization of each of their businesses and operations. Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. 

Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS &#32;for further discussion of the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment discontinued operations. 

Investments 

Amap&#225; 

On December 27, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the sale of our 30 percent &#32;interest in Amap&#225;. Per this original agreement, together with Anglo, we were to sell our respective interest in a 100 percent sale transaction to Zamin. 

On March 28, 2013, an unknown event caused the Santana port shiploader to collapse into the Amazon River, preventing further ship loading by the mine operator, Anglo. In light of the Santana port shiploader collapse and subsequent evaluation of the effect that this event had on the carrying value of our investment in Amap&#225; as of June 30, 2013, we recorded an impairment charge of $67.6 million &#32;in the second quarter of 2013. 

On August 28, 2013, we entered into additional agreements to sell our 30 percent &#32;interest in Amap&#225; to Anglo for nominal cash consideration, plus the right to certain contingent deferred consideration upon the two-year anniversary of the closing. However, no contingent deferred consideration was earned upon the two-year anniversary. The closing was conditional on obtaining certain regulatory approvals and the additional agreement provided Anglo with an option to request that we transfer our interest in Amap&#225; directly to Zamin. Anglo exercised this option and the transfer to Zamin closed in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our interest in Amap&#225; previously was reported as our Latin American iron ore operating segment. 

Applied Technology, Research and Development 

We have been a leader in iron ore mining and process technology for more than 160 years. We operated some of the first mines on Michigan&#8217;s Marquette Iron Range and pioneered early open-pit and underground mining methods. From the first application of electrical power in Michigan&#8217;s underground mines to the use of today&#8217;s sophisticated computers and global positioning satellite systems, we have been a leader in the application of new technology to the centuries-old business of mineral extraction. Today, our engineering and technical staffs are engaged in full-time technical support of our operations and improvement of existing products. 

We are a pioneer in iron ore pelletizing with over 60 years of experience. We are able to produce customized pellets to meet each customer&#8217;s blast furnace specifications, and produce both standard and fluxed pellets. Using our technical expertise and strong market position in the United States to increase our product offering, we have been working on producing DR-grade pellets. In 2015, we produced and shipped a &#32; batch trial of DR-grade pellets, a source of lower silica iron units for the production of direct reduced &#32; iron pellets. In early 2016, we reached a significant milestone with positive results from the successful industrial &#32; trial of our DR-grade pellets. 

With state-of-the-art equipment and experienced technical professionals, we remain on the forefront of mining technology. We have an unsurpassed reputation for our pelletizing technology, delivering a world-class quality product to our customers. We are a pioneer in the development of emerging reduction technologies, a leader in the extraction of value from challenging resources and a frontrunner in the implementation of safe and sustainable technology. Our technical experts are dedicated to excellence and deliver superior technical solutions tailored to our customer base. 

Concentration of Customers 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;we had three &#32;customers that individually accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated product revenue. Product revenue from those customers represented in the chart below totaled approximately $ 1.3 billion , $ 1.9 billion &#32;and $ 1.9 billion &#32;of our total consolidated product revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, and is attributable to our U.S. Iron Ore business segment. The following represents sales revenue from each of these customers as a percentage of our total consolidated product revenue, as well as the portion of product sales for U.S. Iron Ore that is attributable to each of these customers in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively:

ArcelorMittal USA 

Our pellet supply agreements with ArcelorMittal USA are the basis for supplying pellets to ArcelorMittal USA, which is based on customer requirements, except for the Indiana Harbor East facility, which is based on customer contract obligations. The following table outlines the expiration dates for each of the respective agreements:

ArcelorMittal USA is a 62.3 percent &#32;equity participant in Hibbing, as well as, a 21.0 percent &#32;equity partner in Empire with limited rights and obligations. 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to ArcelorMittal were 9.7 million, 10.2 million and 9.5 million tons, respectively. 

AK Steel 

On September 16, 2014, AK Steel announced an acquisition of Severstal North America&#8217;s integrated steelmaking assets located in Dearborn, Michigan. We had a long-term relationship to supply iron ore pellets to Severstal&#8217;s steelmaking assets at that location. Upon consummation of the acquisition, the contract was automatically assigned to AK Steel. The combination of sales pursuant to our preexisting sales agreement with AK Steel and the acquisition of the Dearborn facility with its sales agreement accounts for more than 10 percent of our consolidated product revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

On August 29, 2013 we entered into a new agreement with AK Steel to provide iron ore pellets to AK Steel for use in its Middletown, Ohio and Ashland, Kentucky blast furnace facilities. This contract includes minimum and maximum tonnage requirements for each year between 2014 and 2023. 

Under the original agreement entered into with Severstal in 2006, we supply all of the Dearborn, Michigan facility&#8217;s blast furnace pellet requirements through 2022, subject to specified minimum and maximum requirements in certain years. AK Steel was the successor by merger of this contract and it remains in force. In September 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Dearborn contract with AK Steel to document the 2013 base pricing provisions, among other things, which resulted from an arbitration ruling in May 2014. 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to AK Steel and the acquired Dearborn facility were 4.3 million, 5.8 million and 4.1 million tons, respectively. 

Essar 

Essar Steel Algoma Inc. ("Essar") is a Canadian steelmaker and a subsidiary of Essar Steel Holdings Limited. We had a long term supply agreement under which we were Essar&#8217;s sole supplier of iron ore pellets through the end of 2016 and were required to deliver a set tonnage for less than Essar&#8217;s entire requirements through 2024. There were multiple contract disputes that led to us filing a complaint in the Federal District Court in the Northern District of Ohio on January 12, 2015. During the litigation process we asserted additional claims of material breach as a result of Essar&#8217;s actions during the 2015 calendar year. 

On October 5, 2015, Cliffs terminated the long term agreement with Essar as a result of Essar's multiple and material breaches and ceased to supply Essar with pellets. On November 9, 2015, Essar filed for CCAA and Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection. We do not currently supply pellets to Essar and whether we will be required to supply pellets in the future is undetermined at this time. The Canadian Superior Court may require Cliffs to supply Essar under the terms of the agreement or other terms. Essar moved the Canadian CCAA Court to enter an injunction requiring us to supply pellets. We filed a motion to remove the case to Ohio due to the CCAA Court's lack of jurisdiction. On January 25, 2016, the CCAA Court determined that it has jurisdiction over the issue. We remain open to discussing supplying pellets on commercially reasonable terms consistent with a just-in-time iron ore supply arrangement. Our obligation during 2015 was also undetermined and was a claim that was to be determined in the U.S. litigation. We delivered approximately 2.5 million tons in 2015 prior to termination for which we received payment, but of that amount, approximately 860 thousand tons were carryover tons. Pricing under the terminated agreement had been based on a formula that includes international pellet prices. 

&#32; In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to Essar were 2.5 million, 3.5 million and 3.4 million tons, respectively. 

Competition 

Throughout the world, we compete with major and junior mining companies, as well as metals companies, both of which produce steelmaking raw materials, including iron ore. 

North America 

In our U.S. Iron Ore business segment, we primarily sell our product to steel producers with operations in North America. We compete directly with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the United States and/or Canada, including ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, and with major iron ore pellet exporters from Eastern Canada and Brazil. Additionally, in 2015, finished steel import market share was a record 29 percent in the U.S., up from 28 percent in 2014. As a result, steel utilization rates in North America were recorded at multi-year lows. The reduced demand for U.S. produced steel negatively affects the demand for iron ore pellets within North America. 

A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our iron ore. Continued demand for our iron ore and the prices obtained by us primarily depend on the consumption patterns of the steel industry in the U.S., China and elsewhere around the world, as well as the availability, location, cost of transportation and competing prices. 

Asia Pacific 

In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment, we export iron ore products to the Asia Pacific markets, including China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. In the Asia Pacific marketplace, we compete with major iron ore exporters from Australia, Brazil and South Africa. These include Anglo, BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Rio Tinto plc and Vale, among others. 

Competition in steelmaking raw materials is predicated upon the usual competitive factors of price, availability of supply, product quality and performance, service and transportation cost to the consumer of the raw materials. 

Environment 

Our mining activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. 

Environmental issues and their management continued to be an important focus at each of our operations throughout 2015 . In the construction of our facilities and in their operation, substantial costs have been incurred and will continue to be incurred to avoid undue effect on the environment. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled approximately $17 million, $33 million and $32 million, in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Approximately $5 million, $3 million and $5 million of the 2015, 2014 and 2013 capital expenditures, respectively, relating to environmental matters is attributable to the North American Coal operations that were sold during December 2015. Additionally, approximately $22 million and $14 million of the 2014 and 2013 capital expenditures, respectively, relating to environmental matters, but excluding any expenditures relating to the Bloom Lake tailings and water management system, is attributable to the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations that are currently in restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. It is estimated that capital expenditures for environmental improvements will total approximately $26 million in 2016 which is related to our U.S. Iron Ore operations for various water treatment, air quality, dust control, selenium management, tailings management and other miscellaneous environmental projects. 

Regulatory Developments 

Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect our Company, our customers and our suppliers in many areas, including waste discharge and disposal, the classification of materials and products, air and water discharges and many other environmental, health and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws or regulations reasonably would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations. 

Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could potentially have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: Climate Change and GHG Regulation, Regional Haze, NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Cross State Air Pollution Rule, increased administrative and legislative initiatives related to mining activities, Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy's evolving water quality standards for selenium, sulfate and conductivity and scope of the Clean Water Act and definition of &#8220;Waters of the United States&#8221;. 

Climate Change and GHG Regulation 

With the complexities and uncertainties associated with the U.S. and global navigation of the climate change issue as a whole, one of our significant risks for the future is mandatory carbon legislation. Policymakers are in the design process of carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. The current regulatory patchwork of carbon compliance schemes presents a challenge for multi-facility entities to identify their near-term risks. Amplifying the uncertainty, the dynamic forward outlook for carbon regulation presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change utilizing a formal risk management process. As an energy-intensive business, our GHG emissions inventory captures a broad range of emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, diesel mining equipment and our wholly owned Silver Bay power generation plant, among others. As such, our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts), and (2) the costs passed through to us from power generators and distillate fuel suppliers (indirect impacts). 

Internationally, mechanisms to reduce emissions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. We expect that momentum to extend carbon regulation will continue with passage of the "Paris Climate Agreement" to keep global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius . Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation may have a material impact on the company's customer base, operations and financial results in the future. 

In the U.S., federal carbon regulation potentially presents a significantly greater impact to our operations. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional, and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to carbon control. On May 13, 2010, the U.S. EPA promulgated the GHG Tailoring Rule establishing a mechanism for regulating GHG emissions from facilities through the Prevention of Significant Deterioration permitting program under the CAA. Under the GHG Tailoring Rule, as modified by the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding some components of the rule, new projects that increase GHG emissions by a significant amount (generally more than 75,000 tons of CO 2 &#32;emissions per year) are subject to the PSD requirements, including the installation of best available control technology, if the project also significantly increases emissions of at least one non-GHG regulated criteria pollutant. We do not expect the Tailoring Rule provision to materially adversely affect our business in the near term and we cannot reliably estimate the long term impact of the regulation. 

On June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a memorandum directing the EPA to develop carbon emission standards for both new and existing power plants under the Clean Air Act's NSPS. On October 23, 2015, EPA promulgated the "Clean Power Plan" which consists of NSPS regulating carbon dioxide from existing power plants at a level of approximately 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. States must submit Clean Power Plan SIPs by September 2016, though extension waivers until 2018 are available. These rules do not affect our Silver Bay combined heat and power generating facility. We anticipate that EPA will continue to work on additional GHG NSPS regulations for other industrial categories, including the iron and steel industry, however we cannot reliably estimate the timing or long term impact of future NSPS regulations. 

Due to the EPA's Tailoring Rule and GHG NSPS regulations our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs in order to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced substantially by numerous factors, including currently contemplated regulatory flexibility mechanisms, such as allowance allocations, fixed process emissions exemptions, offsets and international provisions; emissions reduction opportunities, including energy efficiency, biofuels, fuel flexibility, emerging shale gas, coal mine methane offset reduction; and business opportunities associated with pursuing combined heat and power partnerships and new products, including DRI pellets, fluxed pellets and other technology. 

We have worked proactively to develop a comprehensive, enterprise-wide GHG management strategy aimed at considering all significant aspects associated with GHG initiatives to plan effectively for and manage climate change issues, including risks and opportunities as they relate to the environment, stakeholders, including shareholders and the public, legislative and regulatory developments, operations, products and markets. 

Regional Haze 

In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to its regional haze rules. The rules require states establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all Class I national parks and wilderness areas. Among the states with Class I areas are Michigan and Minnesota in which we currently own and manage mining operations. The first phase of the regional haze rule (2008-2018) requires analysis and installation of BART on eligible emission sources and incorporation of BART and associated emission limits into SIPs. 

Minnesota submitted a regional haze SIP to the EPA on December 30, 2009, and a supplement to the SIP on May 8, 2012. Michigan submitted its regional haze SIP to the EPA on November 5, 2010. During the second quarter of 2012, the EPA also sent information requests to all taconite facilities requesting information on SO 2 &#32;and NOx emissions and control technology assessments. On June 12, 2012, the EPA approved revisions to the Minnesota SIP addressing regional haze, but also announced it was deferring action on emission limitations that Minnesota intended to represent BART for taconite facilities. On August 15, 2012, the EPA proposed to deny the Michigan and Minnesota taconite SIP BART determinations and simultaneously proposed a separate FIP for taconite facilities. During the comment period for the proposed FIP rule, the taconite industry and other stakeholders developed detailed comments and shared information to address furnace specific case-by-case circumstances. On January 15, 2013, the EPA signed the final FIP for taconite facilities. The final FIP reflects progress toward a more technically and economically feasible regional haze implementation plan and eliminates the need for investing in additional SO 2 emission control equipment. However, we remain concerned about the technical and economic feasibility of EPA's BART determination for NOx emissions and we filed a petition for review in the 8 th &#32;Circuit Court and subsequently received a judicial stay of the FIP which enabled us to conduct a detailed engineering analysis to determine the impact of the regulations on each unique iron ore indurating furnace affected by this rule. The results of this analysis enabled us to reach a settlement with EPA which was incorporated into an amended rule and public noticed in the Federal Register on October 22, 2015. Cost estimates associated with the settlement are reflected in our 5-year capital plan. 

NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;National Ambient Air Quality Standards 

During the first half of 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require states to use a combination of air quality monitoring and computer modeling to determine areas of each state that are in attainment with new NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;standards and those areas that are not in attainment with such standards. During the third quarter of 2011, the EPA issued guidance to the regulated community on conducting refined air quality dispersion modeling and implementing the new NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;standards. During June 2011, our Minnesota iron ore mining operations received a request from the MPCA to develop modeling and compliance plans by which each facility would demonstrate compliance with the NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;NAAQS pursuant to the Taconite Regional Haze SIP Long Term Strategy (LTS). Compliance with the LTS modeling demonstrations was originally set for June 30, 2017. On August 20, 2015, EPA released its final Data Requirement Rule (DRR) for characterizing SO 2 &#32;sources under the 2010 1 Hr SO 2 &#32;NAAQS. Cliffs&#8217; operation subject to the SO 2 &#32;DRR, Northshore Mining, is anticipated to demonstrate compliance with the SO 2 &#32;DRR without incurring additional capital investment. All of our other operations in Minnesota and Michigan are expected to be in attainment for NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;NAAQS without incurring additional capital investment. Further, Minnesota is expected to remove NAAQS modeling obligations under the LTS in light of reduction in haze emissions associated with pending amendment of the taconite Regional Haze FIP regulations. While we will continue to monitor these developments and assess potential impacts to Cliffs, we do not anticipate further capital investments will be necessary for the pending NO 2 &#32;and SO 2 &#32;DRR SIP rulemaking. 

Cross State Air Pollution Rule 

On July 6, 2011, the EPA promulgated the CSAPR, which was intended to be an emissions trading rule for SO 2 &#32;and NOx. Northshore's Silver Bay Power Plant would have been subject to this rule; however Minnesota elected to follow EPA guidance allowing CSAPR to stand as BART. CSAPR was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court during the third quarter of 2012. Late in 2014, the Supreme Court re-instated CSAPR with an effective date of January 1, 2015, re-instating the obligations of this rule for Silver Bay Power. In January, 2016, the 8 th &#32;Circuit Court of Appeals re-affirmed EPA use of CSAPR is equal to or better than BART. Immediate compliance obligations are being met at this time, with the material obligation being procurement of the first year of emissions allowances by March 2016 for the 2015 operating year. Silver Bay Power has installed low NOx burners to reduce emissions that will limit the cost exposure to the emission trading market. The allowance pricing market indicates the annual costs to comply with CSAPR will be less than $0.2 million for 2015 and future allowance prices are anticipated to remain favorable under the existing framework. While we will continue to monitor the availability and pricing of CSAPR allowances and future EPA allocations of CSAPR allowances to Northshore&#8217;s Silver Bay Power Plant, we do not anticipate exposure to material costs for existing CSAPR obligations and we cannot reasonably estimate the long term impact of CSAPR should EPA reduce the allocations in response to future lower ozone or PM2.5 regulations. 

Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy 

TMDL regulations are contained in the Clean Water Act. As a part of Minnesota's Mercury TMDL Implementation Plan, in cooperation with the MPCA, the taconite industry developed a Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy and signed a voluntary agreement in 2009 to effectuate its terms. The strategy includes a 75 percent target reduction of mercury air emissions from Minnesota pellet plants collectively by 2025. It recognizes that mercury emission control technology currently does not exist and will be pursued through a research effort. According to the voluntary agreement, any developed technology must meet the &#8220;adaptive management criteria&#8221; such that the technology must be economically feasible, must not impact pellet quality, and must not cause excessive corrosion in pellet furnaces, associated duct work and existing wet scrubbers on the furnaces. 

According to the voluntary agreement, the mines proceeded with medium- and long-term testing of possible technologies. For Cliffs, the requirements in the voluntary agreement apply to the United Taconite and Hibbing facilities. At this time, we are unable to predict the potential impacts of the voluntary Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy. However, a number of research projects were conducted between 2011 and 2014 as the industry continues to assess options for reduction. While injection of powdered activated carbon into furnace off-gasses for mercury capture in the wet scrubbers showed positive initial results, further testing during 2013 yielded lower overall potential. Alternate technologies are presently being assessed in our ongoing efforts to develop cost effective mercury reduction technologies for our indurating furnaces. 

On September 22, 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rule mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reduction. The adopted rule expanded applicability to all of our Minnesota operations and requires submitting a mercury reduction plan in 2018 to reduce mercury emissions from all of our Minnesota taconite furnaces by 72 percent by January 2025. The adopted rule does not include all four Adaptive Management Criteria for evaluating mercury reduction, which were agreed upon in the October 2009 Minnesota&#8217;s Mercury TMDL Implementation Plan. 

To date, there is currently no proven technology to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to the target level of 72 percent that would meet all four Adaptive Management Criteria. We remain concerned about the technical and economic feasibility to reduce taconite mercury emissions by 72 percent and are conducting detailed engineering analysis to determine the impact of the regulations on each unique iron ore indurating furnace affected by this rule. The results of this analysis will guide further dialog with the MPCA regarding our implementation of the requirements. Because development of the technology is in the early stages, any impacts to Cliffs are not estimable at this time. 

Selenium Discharge Regulation 

In Michigan, Empire and Tilden have developed compliance strategies to manage selenium according to the permit conditions. Empire and Tilden submitted the first permit required Selenium Storm Water Management Plan to the MDEQ in December 2011; and have updated it annually as required. The Selenium Storm Water Management Plan outlines the activities that will be undertaken to address selenium in storm water discharges from our Michigan operations. A prefeasibility engineering estimate for full scale implementation of the storm water collection and conveyance system by November 2017 is approximately $24 million and is included in the 5-year capital plan. A storm water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated sometime before 2025. The cost of the future treatment systems could be significant, although we are continuing to assess and develop cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies. 

Tilden's NPDES permit contains a compliance schedule for selenium with a limit of five &#181;g/l that will be effective as of November 1, 2017, at Tilden's Gribben Tailings Basin outfall. Tilden initiated a prudent and feasible alternatives analysis to further define solutions and cost estimates. An engineering estimate for the selected suite of solutions indicates capital costs will be less than $23 million. In July 2015, the EPA proposed new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria which may increase the cost for treatment. We are incorporating this contingency into our planning and treatment technology assessment. 

Definition of &#8220;Waters of the United States&#8221; Under the Clean Water Act 

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers&#8217; promulgated the rule, &#8220;Definition of &#8216;Waters of the United States&#8217; Under the Clean Water Act,&#8221; 80 Fed. Reg. 37053 (June 29, 2015), which attempted to add clarity to which waters are jurisdictional under the federal Clean Water Act, and will apply to all Clean Water Act programs, including the Sec. 402 and Sec. 404 permitting programs, Sec. 311 spill prevention program and Sec. 401 state certification process. It is unclear how the federal and state agencies will implement and enforce the final rule, and how the courts will interpret going forward. The regulation may expand EPA&#8217;s authority under the Clean Water Act to many traditionally unregulated mine features such as mine pits, pit lakes, on site ditches, water retention structures, and tailings basins creating a new burden on our U.S. facilities. This could further be interpreted to add questionable regulatory authority over the groundwater connections between these features and nearby traditionally navigable waters. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of this rule while the jurisdiction and legality of the rule are decided in court. We are actively participating in the rulemaking development and assessing the potential impacts to our operations. Because the rule is being litigated, and until the rule is finally implemented, any impacts to Cliffs are not estimable at this time. 

Minnesota&#8217;s Proposed Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard 

The Minnesota Legislature provided $1.5 million in 2011 for a study to gather additional information about the effects of sulfate and other substances on the growth of wild rice, and to support an update to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard originally adopted in 1973 by the MPCA. The MPCA contracted with the University of Minnesota to conduct several research projects as part of this study. Concurrently, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce contracted an independent lab to conduct companion research on the impacts of sulfate on wild rice. In March 2015, MPCA released a draft proposal for protecting wild rice from sulfate, which included a draft sulfate wild rice water quality standard, a draft list of waters where the standard would apply, and criteria for adding waters to that list. The draft wild rice water quality standard is an equation that utilizes measured sediment parameters to calculate a sulfate limit protective of wild rice. The independent research conducted by the independent lab contracted by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce does not directly support the validity of the MPCA&#8217;s proposed approach. The rulemaking has a legislated deadline for completion of January 15, 2018. Due to the proposed standard being based on measured sediment parameters that Cliffs is not in possession of near our operating facilities, and uncertainty regarding which waters the standard will apply to, the impacts of the proposed wild rice water quality standard to Cliffs are not estimable at this time. 

Conductivity 

Conductivity, the measurement of water&#8217;s ability to conduct electricity, is a surrogate parameter that generally increases as the amount of dissolved minerals in water increases. In 2011, the EPA issued &#8220;A Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Conductivity in Central Appalachian Streams&#8221; which established a recommended conductivity benchmark of 300 &#181;S/cm for the region. The issuance of a benchmark outside of the established rulemaking process was subsequently the subject of litigation in National Mining Association v. Jackson , 880 F. Supp. 2d 119 (D.D.C. 2012) where the court ruled the benchmark is nothing more than a non-binding suggestion. Three years later in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, et al. v. Elk Run Coal Co., et al. , 3:12-cv-00785 (S.D. W. Va.), a judicial decision held that levels of conductivity higher than the EPA&#8217;s benchmark constituted a violation of the state&#8217;s narrative water quality standards, were unsupported by science and contrary to decisions previously made by the West Virginia DEP and the West Virginia Supreme Court. In 2015, a group filed a petition with EPA Region 5 alleging that Minnesota was failing to properly implement the state NPDES program; and one of the various allegations asserts that MPCA should be assessing compliance with the state&#8217;s narrative water quality standard against the EPA&#8217;s conductivity benchmark for the Central Appalachian region. On December 30, 2015, the EPA provided MPCA a draft of the Protocol for Responding to Issues Related to Permitting and Enforcement which indicates that EPA staff will be reviewing available scientific basis in peer reviewed literature as well as promulgated standards. Since the EPA&#8217;s review has yet to begin and the forthcoming findings and recommendations, if any, are unknown, the exact nature of the risk to Cliffs is unknown; however, direct application of the 300 &#181;S/cm benchmark to Cliffs&#8217; Minnesota-based assets may have a material impact. 

For additional information on our environmental matters, refer to Item 3. &#32; Legal Proceedings &#32;and NOTE 11 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND MINE CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS &#32;in Item 8. &#32; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Energy 

Electricity 

The state of Michigan is a deregulated electricity state, which affords our mines the ability to purchase electrical energy supply from various suppliers while continuing to purchase distribution service from the incumbent utility. As of September 1, 2013, our Tilden and Empire mines in Michigan exercised the right to purchase electrical supply from Integrys Energy Services while continuing to purchase distribution service from Wisconsin Electric Power Company. The pricing of electricity in the deregulated market is based on the Midwestern Independent System Operator Day-Ahead price. Beginning on February 1, 2015, we began purchasing our electricity supply from the Wisconsin Electric Power Company in a regulated fashion as we terminated our contract with Integrys Energy Services. As of February 1, 2015, Wisconsin Electric Power Company is the sole supplier of electric power to our Empire and Tilden mines. As of April 24, 2015, the Tilden and Empire mines executed special electricity contracts with Wisconsin Electric Power Company. The term of these contracts is through 2019. Wisconsin Electric Power Company provides 300 megawatts of electricity to Empire and Tilden at special rates that are regulated by the MPSC. The pricing under these contracts is generally fixed except Empire and Tilden are subject to frequent changes in Wisconsin Electric Power Company's power supply adjustment factor. Empire and Tilden may also incur additional liabilities depending on the outcome of various proceedings concerning MISO's revised cost allocation methodology for continued operation of the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. If FERC were to decide to award SSR costs based on a revised cost allocation methodology applied retroactively, this could result in a substantial potential liability to our Empire and Tilden mines. 

Electric power for the Hibbing and United Taconite mines is supplied by Minnesota Power. On September 16, 2008, the mines finalized agreements with terms from November 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015. The agreements were approved by the MPUC in 2009. The terms of the agreements included an automatic five-year extension that began January 1, 2016. 

Silver Bay Power Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, with a 115 megawatt power plant, provides the majority of Northshore&#8217;s electrical energy requirements. Silver Bay Power has an interconnection agreement with Minnesota Power for backup power when excess generation is necessary. 

Koolyanobbing and its associated satellite mines draw power from independent diesel-fueled power stations and generators. Diesel power generation capacity has been installed at the Koolyanobbing operations. 

Process and Diesel Fuel 

We have a long-term contract providing for the transport of natural gas on the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline for our U.S. Iron Ore operations. At U.S. Iron Ore, the Empire and Tilden mines have the capability of burning natural gas, coal or, to a lesser extent, oil. The Hibbing and Northshore mines have the capability to burn natural gas and oil. The United Taconite mine has the ability to burn coal, natural gas and petroleum coke. Consistent with 2015, we expect during 2016 our U.S. Iron Ore operations will utilize both natural gas and coal to heat furnaces and produce power at our Silver Bay Power facility. 

All of our mines utilize diesel fuel mainly for our mobile fleet. Como Oil and Propane supplies diesel fuel to all of our U.S. Iron Ore locations from the Calumet refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. Our U.S. Iron Ore locations are contracted with Como Oil and Propane through the end of 2018.

(1) Includes our employees and the employees of the U.S. Iron Ore joint ventures. 

(2) Excludes contracted mining employees 

(3) Excludes the employees on lay-off as a result of the idling of the United Taconite and Northshore mines. 

As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 81.0 percent &#32;of our U.S. Iron Ore hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. This percentage includes the U.S. Iron Ore hourly employees that are on lay-off and excluded from the table above. 

Hourly employees at our Michigan and Minnesota iron ore mining operations, excluding Northshore, are represented by the USW and are covered by labor agreements between the USW and our various operating entities. These labor agreements that cover approximately 2,000 &#32;USW-represented employees at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan, and our United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota had an original term of September 1, 2012 through September 30, 2015. We are actively negotiating with the USW for new agreements at those locations and have mutually extended our agreements indefinitely with either party able to terminate upon seven days&#8217; written notice. &#32; Employees at our Northshore operations are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Hourly employees at our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations also are represented by the USW. The labor agreement with the USW that covers our represented employees at Bloom Lake is effective from September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2016. The labor agreement with the USW that covers our represented employees at our Pointe Noire facility, is effective from March 1, 2014 through February 28, 2020. The costs associated with the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore employees that are shown in the chart above are not included in our consolidated results due to the deconsolidation of our Canadian Entities in 2015. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS &#32;for further discussion of the Canadian Entities. 

Hourly employees at our Lake Superior and Ishpeming railroads are represented by seven unions covering approximately 108 employees. The labor agreements that cover these employees reopened for bargaining on December 

31, 2014 and we are actively bargaining with the seven unions that represent them for successor agreements. These employees negotiate under the Railway Labor Act, which provides that labor agreements remain in force until replaced by a successor agreement. Under the Railway Labor Act work stoppages cannot occur until the parties have engaged in substantial negotiations, have mediated any disputes and have received a release from the National Mediation Board. 

Employees at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Corporate and Support Services are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

Safety 

Safety is our primary core value as we continue toward a zero incident culture at our operating facilities. We continuously monitor, track and measure our safety performance and make changes where necessary. Best practices are shared globally to ensure each mine site can embed our policies, procedures and learnings for enhanced workplace safety. We measure progress toward achieving our objective against regularly established benchmarks, including measuring company-wide TRIR. During 2015, our TRIR (including contractors) was 1.71 per 200,000 man-hours worked. 

Refer to Exhibit &#32; 95 &#32; Mine Safety Disclosures (filed herewith) &#32;for mine safety information required in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
