 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

American Education Center Inc. was incorporated in Nevada (&#8220;AEC Nevada&#8221;) in May 2014 as a holding company, and operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, American Education Center Inc., incorporated in the state of New York in 1999 (&#8220;AEC New York&#8221;). AEC Nevada, together with its wholly owned subsidiary AEC New York, is referred to as the &#8220;Company.&#8221; The Company is devoted to international education exchange and provides education-related consulting services such as educational and career enrichment opportunities to students, educators and educational institutions in both the PRC and the United States. 

&#160;

AEC New York was approved and licensed by the Education Department of the state of New York in 2003 to engage in education consulting service between the U.S. and China. For over fifteen years, AEC New York has devoted itself to international education exchange between China and the United States, by providing education and career enrichment opportunities for students, teachers, and educational institutions from both countries.

&#160;

Our mission is to provide &#8220;one-stop comprehensive services&#8221; to international students, educators, educational institutions and corporate entities. Our services include admission applications, visa applications, accommodations and other consulting services to Chinese students who wish to study in the United States, placement services to qualified American educators to teach and live in China, as well as U.S. relocation services to employees of multi-national companies with U.S. operations. 

&#160;

Currently, we primarily provide five types of services: Students Services, Institution Services, Student Exchange Program, Executive Services, as well as Educator Placements. Services to our clients are provided through the Company&#8217;s principal executive office in New York, NY. For marketing, we engage local agents in Nanjing of Jiangsu Province, Chengdu of Sichuan Province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang Province, and Shanghai in China to promote our services to potential clients, and we plan to engage more agents in China in the future. We also have entered into cooperation contracts with business partners in Jiangxi, Shanghai and Shenzhen on May 29, 2014, June 10, 2014 and May 7, 2014, respectively, allowing our business partners to set up representative offices bearing the name of America Education Center in each of these locations. As of the date of this annual report, we have not yet set up representative offices in Jiangxi, nor have we registered with local authorities to operate our businesses in these locations.

&#160;

Our Student Services provide guidance and consulting services to help our customers throughout their application and admission process, their studying and living needs during the schooling leading to their degree, and also help them secure suitable internships and other career opportunities in the United States. The Company categorizes this service into three parts: academic, life and career. Our academic part focuses on providing admission services for Chinese students to study in the U.S., English as a Second Language (ESL) training program, and the Elite 100 program. Our life program offers consulting services, including personalized VIP service, to assist our Chinese customers to settle down in the U.S. so they can focus effectively on their studies, as well as VIP services for the parents of our students to visit and/or settle in the U.S. The Company refers its customers to the Company&#8217;s business partners in the U.S. to assist the customers with purchasing real estate properties, understanding financial management and investment, buying insurance and starting businesses. Our Career Program focuses on assisting clients to improve their career development by identifying internship and work opportunities that are suitable to their educational background and experience level.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Institution Services Program mainly focuses on providing recruiting and consulting services to educational institutions in the U.S. such as middle schools, high schools, and universities and colleges, to enroll students from China. As part of our Institution Services, the University Pathway Program (UPP), established in 2008, offers consulting services to various U.S. universities to enroll qualified international students in these universities and explore possible collaborations with select universities in China.

&#160;

Pursuant to our Student Exchange Programs, we recruit and enroll Chinese students in U.S. educational institutions for Exchange Programs (students will finish the remainder of their education in China and receive their diploma in China). As part of these programs, we have engaged St. Peter&#8217;s University to serve as an education consultant as they are more experienced in such Exchange programs.

&#160;

Pursuant to our Executive Services program, we also provide services to our corporate clients whose executives are moving to the U.S. for work. We assist them in all aspects of relocation as well as their preparation for visa applications.

&#160;

Our Educator Placement Program is designed to meet the increasing demands for foreign teachers in both the U.S. and China. Our program helps teachers in the U.S. or China who plan to gain experience in another country find the most suitable positions. We also recruit and place native English speaking teachers for our clients and business partners in China, and recruit and place Chinese-speaking teachers in U.S. educational institutions. 

&#160;

Prior to December 31, 2013, in certain cases, we collected our service fees in advance from clients. If we were not successful in all of the promised services, these fees were refundable. Accordingly, until all the promised work was completed successfully, these fees were shown as deferred revenue. Commencing in 2014, in order to better manage our Company financially, we changed our policy. We now have discontinued utilizing the refund provisions in our consulting agreements and recognize deferred revenue based on completion of the service. The Company offers a limited refund policy to students who have received consulting services regarding their H1B visas. Consulting services for H1B visas are prepaid. A portion of such prepayment will become non-refundable once the Company completes preparation and files the visa applications on behalf of the clients. If the visa application is accepted, the remaining prepayment will be recognized as revenue, if not, the remaining prepayment will be refunded.

&#160;

Growth Strategy &#160;

&#160;

We intend to expand our business as follows, although there is no guarantee that we will carry out our growth strategy as expected:

&#160;

* Organic Growth &#160;

We plan to organize our sales efforts to create organic growth from existing clients. From our existing client base, we will provide the highest level of individual services to help our clients in any way to have a smooth transition to the U.S., including visa consulting services, travel guides, life advice, investment consulting and other services.

&#160;

* Build Relationships &#160;

Through over 15 years of continuous growth, we have built significant industry credibility and a solid reputation, which enables us to partner with quality third-party businesses in providing services to our clients when needed, which provides quality services efficiently and at a competitive cost. 

&#160;

* Online Service Development &#160;

The Internet allows people to gain access to online resources and services without the limitation of location and time, and providing services over the Internet often increases the revenue for many companies. We are developing our own web-based products to better reach and serve additional customers who would otherwise not benefit from our services, while we continue to expand our business network through our institutional clients.

Industry 

&#160;

The demand for global education is growing rapidly in China. The number of Chinese students that studied in the U.S. exploded in 2006, when Congress loosened its restrictions on student visas from China for the first time since the tragic events of 9-11. This sudden influx has resulted in what we believe to be a large number of Chinese students in the U.S. who lack sufficient support and services. 

&#160;

International students who plan to study overseas need high quality education consulting services. We strive to become a bridge for these students, to facilitate international study and education, by providing fully structured education consulting services. Our comprehensive solution for international students includes three broad categories: Pre-Entrance services, Post-Entrance services, and VIP Personalized services. 

&#160;

Pursuant to a report published by the Ministry of Education of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on May 27, 2014, since 1978, more than three million Chinese students have studied in a foreign country.

&#160; 

According to the Project Atlas project compiled by the Institute of International Education, in the academic year of 2014-2015, the total number of Chinese students studying abroad reached 459,800, among which 274,439, or approximately 59.7%, pursued a higher education degree in the U.S. According to the Project Atlas project compiled by the Institute of International Education, The total number of international students studying in the U.S. has reached a record high of 886,052 in the 2013 to 2014 academic year.

&#160; 

Based on the historical data and current favorable conditions, the Company projects that the market will maintain rapid growth in the next five years. The market size has been previously expected to increase at an average rate of 23% for Chinese students to study in the U.S., and as such, the number of Chinese students in the U.S. is estimated to be as follows:

&#160; 

Year &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2017 &#160; &#160; 2018 &#160; Number of Students &#160; &#160; 304,040 &#160; &#160; &#160; 373,970 &#160; &#160; &#160; 459,982 &#160; &#160; &#160; 565,778 &#160; &#160; &#160; 695,907 &#160; 

&#160;

In addition, the number of U.S. students studying in China is also experiencing steady growth. In 2012 alone, 14,167 American students were studying in China and the average annual growth rate in the four years prior to 2012 has been 2%.

&#160;

However, the Company estimates the growth rate to be at least double this for the next few years for the following reasons. Both the U.S. and Chinese government encourage Chinese-American education exchange and cooperation. President Obama&#8217;s 100,000 strong initiative program advocates sending American students to study abroad in China and promote American culture. This will not only help increase the number of American students willing to study abroad in China, but will also increase our client base and further improve our competitiveness in the industry. The current annual number of American students studying abroad in China per year is roughly 25,000, and we expect this number will continue growing in the following years. However, this number has been increasing at a rapid rate. Second, more policies make it easier for American students to study in China. In fact, the Chinese government has relaxed the regulations on American students in recent years. Lastly, rising international influence and status significantly improve China's allure to American students. The Company projects the number of American students studying in China is estimated as follows (based upon a 4% projected annual growth rate):

&#160;

Our Business &#160;

&#160;

We provide Student Services, Educator Placement, and Institutional Services to students, teachers and educational institutions in the U.S. and China. Our Student Service is a &#8220;one-stop comprehensive service&#8221; that assists our clients with academic applications, admissions and supports their individual needs during their study, internship and career development. Our Institutional Service assists U.S. institutions in establishing alliances and strategic business partnerships with colleges and universities in China, as well as enrolling a growing number of Chinese students. Our executive program provides U.S. relocation services to employees of multi-national companies with U.S. operations. Our Educator Placement program creates opportunities for teachers and educators between the U.S. and China. 

&#160;

Student Services &#160; 

&#160;

We provide guidance and consulting services to help our customers throughout their application and the admission process during their study and also help them find internships and other career opportunities in the United States. We categorize this service into three programs: academic, life and career. As of today, we have provided these services to hundreds of students from China to study in middle and high schools, colleges and universities in the U.S. 

&#160;

The three programs are as follows: 

&#160;

Academic Program &#160;

&#160;

Our Academic Program focuses on assisting students between the ages of 15 and 25. For middle school students, we assist in providing information on U.S. high schools. We also help high school graduates with admission&#8217;s applications to U.S. colleges and universities. 

&#160;

In addition to our admission services, we provide English as a Second Language (&#8220;ESL&#8221;) classes and one-on-one tutoring to improve students&#8217; language skills and assist them in preparing for language competency tests. We established the ESL program in 2002 and have published a complete package of textbooks, examinations and certificates. These materials cover listening, speaking, reading and writing English. We place ESL teachers in our representative offices in China to conduct the ESL programs. Students who enroll in this program receive preparation in taking ESL tests and will obtain certificates upon successfully passing these tests. This program requires approximately 85 hours of training. We are enhancing our joint efforts with U.S. universities aiming to make our ESL certificates widely recognized as a substitute to TOFEL scores for admission tests. The Company has not registered &#8220;American Education Center&#8221; as trade or business name. The Company printed brochures and manuals with the logo of American Education Center and distributes such materials to students free of charge at our ELS programs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

AEC&#8217;s Elite 100 Program, is aimed at elite Chinese students with academic excellence. In this program we provide consulting services to top talented Chinese students to enable these students to reach a comprehensive understanding of United States political, business, science, education, culture and other areas. First, we offer academic consulting services to these elite Chinese students to apply to prestigious colleges and universities in the United States. In connection with our admission services, we assist these students in arranging campus tours, writing programs, tailored ESL language programs and interview guidance. After the students are admitted into U.S. colleges/universities, we provide consulting services in connection with applications for a second major, transfers, housing accommodations&#8217;, accelerated degree applications and other services. We enroll the students in seminars and events in which we partner with other business organizations, governments, non-government organizations (&#8220;NGOs&#8221;), scholars and universities to help these students build social networks and cultivate their leadership skills. We also help arrange after school activities tailored for each student, such as dancing classes, international concerts, organizing students to participate in singing, painting, photography and performance competitions to enrich their cultural experience. 

&#160;

The Company offers University Placement Services (the &#8220;UPP&#8221; program) to a number of American and Chinese universities including &#8220;Ivy League&#8221; schools in the United States, and in China, Peking University and Tsinghua University. Students can benefit from our alliances in both China and the U.S. We specialize in improving our students&#8217; qualifications and assisting them in preparing for schools which are suited for their personal needs. 

&#160;

In August 2014, we entered into a consulting agreement with the Guangzhou Branch of the New Oriental Education &#38;Technology Group (&#8220;New Oriental Guangzhou&#34;) providing education courses to students enrolled in New Oriental Guangzhou&#8217;s UPP 1+3 program. We terminated this consulting agreement with New Oriental Guangzhou in April 2015 due to the failure of New Oriental Guangzhou to recruit a sufficient number of students to enroll in the UPP 1+3 program and failure to observe the profit sharing agreement between us and New Oriental Guangzhou as set forth in the contract. 

&#160;

Life Program &#160;

&#160;

Our Life Program offers consulting services to assist Chinese students in acclimating to United States society. We provide assistance in all facets of everyday life, for instance, we will refer students to individuals/companies who are involved in the areas of real estate, financial management and investment, buying insurance and starting businesses. Our mission is to assist students with their daily basic needs so they can focus on their education. 

&#160;

Our Personalized VIP Service, which is one of our key businesses, provides &#8220;concierge services&#8221; personally tailored for our clients to meet almost all aspects of their needs during their stay in the U.S. Every VIP client has an exclusive consultant to help meet his or her needs and monitors their progress along the way, so that a customized career plan can be developed taking into consideration changing economic and personal conditions. VIP services include high school enrollment, college applications, medical insurance, parental travel support, housing, legal and immigration status, internship, job application and referrals to financial and real estate investment advisory firms and other related services.

&#160;

Career Program &#160;

&#160;

Our Career Program focuses on assisting students in their career choices by identifying internships and work opportunities that are suitable to their interests, educational background and experience level. Through this program we strive to provide clients with potential career paths, assist them in every step of the way from academic improvement to career assistance. In addition, we introduce our student customers to companies and prospective employers that may potentially provide internships and part-time or full-time work opportunities to our student customers.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Optional Practical Training (&#8220;OPT&#8221;) services are offered to those who are in college or pursuing master graduate degrees to communicate with government authorities on any matter concerning the OPT application. The OPT service fee is refundable if the application is denied. If the student terminates the application, the student will be not required to make further payment; but the fee already paid are nonrefundable.

&#160;

Institutional Services 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Institutional Services Program mainly focuses on providing international consulting and recruiting services to U.S. schools, colleges and universities.

&#160;

Educational institutions in the U.S., from middle school, high schools, to colleges and universities, retain us to reach, market to and recruit a broader demographic region of prospective students. Although most U.S. educational institutions are interested in attracting more students from China to diversify their student bodies, they often have a difficult time marketing to and enrolling students from China often due to lack of understanding of the Chinese culture and lack of access to qualified students. We serve as an international liaison to provide marketing services to students in China.

&#160;

Through our representative offices in China and our marketing business partners in China, we have access to Chinese students who are seeking admission to and enrollment in U.S. middle schools and colleges and universities. We are authorized by each respective educational institutions to market their institution, their academic programs and their student lives, on their behalf. In addition to the general programs, we have two specific programs, University pathway Program and Graduate Data Science Program. In addition, we assist educational institutions in searching for and retaining qualified lecturers and professors to teach in the partnership programs in both the U.S. and China.

&#160;

University Pathway Program (&#8220;UPP&#8221;) 

&#160;

The University Pathway Program, established in 2008, offers consulting and marketing services to U.S. higher education institutions such as colleges and universities to enroll qualified international students and explore possible collaborations with select universities and high school in China. Students enrolled in the UPP program have either: (i) completed two of three years high school education in China, who then enroll in the UPP program approved by such high school in China and its partner universities and colleges in the United States, or (ii) divide their studies for the same major or degree between Chinese colleges and universities and partner with U.S. universities allowing the students to obtain bachelor&#8217;s degrees from both institutions.

&#160;

Our most significant partner pursuant to the UPP program is the State University of New York (&#8220;SUNY&#8221;). SUNY is the largest comprehensive university system in the United States, with 64 institutions globally, including research universities, academic medical centers, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, agricultural and technical institutes and an online learning network. SUNY educates approximately 463,000 students in more than 7,500 degree and certificate programs, and nearly 2 million students in workforce and professional development programs. Our clients who are students enrolling in the UPP program, earn credits under our program that are transferrable to any institution in the SUNY system. The Company is obligated to refund the full amount of consulting service fees to any client enrolled in UPP program if the customer fails to be admitted by SUNY by the end of application process.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

AEC will contract with additional U.S. high schools, colleges and universities to assign teachers and professors to its UPP program in China, and assist U.S. colleges to recruit and place qualified educators in China subject to their approval.

&#160;

Graduate Data Science Program 

&#160; 

We have entered into an agency agreement with Saint Peter&#8217;s University to recruit students from China for their Masters of Science Program in Data Science program. The goal of the Graduate Data Science Program is to enable students to develop knowledge, skills and values needed for their leadership in serving others and shaping their adaptability to social, technological and environmental changes. It was developed by computer science engineers to align with &#8220;best industry practice&#8221; in big data concepts utilized by the Oracle Corporation. The curriculum has tight integration with the most current Oracle Corporation approaches to the management of big data technology and business intelligence.

&#160;

The Masters of Science Program in Data Science with a concentration in Business Analytics is a 12 course/36 credit degree program, designed for part-time and full-time students who have completed undergraduate degrees in science, mathematics, computer science or engineering and are interested in pursuing careers in industry-specific analytical fields. The inaugural class started in the fall of 2015 at Saint Peter&#8217;s University. Saint Peter&#8217;s University will pay the Company a commission equal to 15% of tuition.

&#160;

Saint Peter&#8217;s University has appointed Max P. Chen, our President and chairman of our board of directors, as Executive Director of Chinese Educational Partners. We will refer Chinese students to study at Saint Peter&#8217;s University for Master&#8217;s Degrees and Baccalaureate Study. The partnership also includes having Saint Peter&#8217;s University&#8217;s faculty teach its programs in China. Some courses are taken in China and other courses are taken in the United States on the Saint Peter&#8217;s University campus. We also will explore opportunities to offer college courses to high school students in China, although there are no definitive agreements in place and no guarantee such agreements will be executed.

&#160;

Recruiting Services 

&#160;

For most of the prestigious Chinese educational institutions, the desire for native-speaking English teachers is higher than ever. We currently focus on placing qualified American teachers into Chinese schools and institutions. As of today, in addition to placing English language teachers for our ELS programs in China, we also placed English speaking teachers for physics and American history majors for Nanjing Jinling High School in 2012 and business majors for Nanjing Jinling High School in 2013.

&#160;

Meanwhile, the increased demand of learning Mandarin has been driven by China's ascendancy in the global economy. Mandarin has become the first choice among second languages. By applying our years of experience and knowledge, the Company plans to provide unified and quality Mandarin Chinese teachers for U.S. institutions in the future.

&#160;

Educator Placements 

&#160;

Our Educator Placement Program aims to meet the increasing demand for foreign teachers in both the U.S. and China. We help teachers in the U.S. or China who desire to work abroad find the most suitable positions. In order to ensure that educators experience a smooth transition, we also provide local services to educators, which include settlement services, financial services, assistance with insurance coverage, tax services, living services, as well as business consulting services.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The education consulting business in China is rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive, and we expect competition in this sector to persist and intensify. We face competition in each of the major service segments we offer and each geographic market in which we operate. For example, we face competition for our student services from Boya Elite International Company, which offers overseas educational programs for students and executives from China. We face competition from the Study Abroad Foundation for our institutional services, which advises study-abroad host educational institutions on attracting international students and better structuring study abroad programs according to the needs of international students. For our educator placement services, we compete with the First Abroad Organization, which introduces teachers from America to work in China. We also face PRC competition for our English as a Second Language (&#8220;ESL&#8221;) preparation courses from companies that offer similar preparation courses in China. However, we believe that we do not have competitors who integrate and provide services in all these major segments (for students, institutions, and educators) like our business.

&#160;

We believe the principal competitive advantages in our market include the following:

&#160;

&#183; provide one-stop integrated services to students, teachers, and institutions; &#160;

&#183; brand recognition and reputation; &#160;

&#183; a service model that aligns personalized services to the specific needs of students and institutions; &#160;

&#183; overall customer satisfaction; &#160;

&#183; size and coverage of service network and proximity of services to customers; &#160;

&#183; scope, quality and consistency of service. &#160;

Our key competitive strengths lie in our individualized attention to students, our ability to place educators at top universities around the globe and specifically in the US, and our understanding of the globalization needs of top universities in recruiting both international students and faculty in an ever evolving educational landscape, with one-stop service. However, some of our existing and potential competitors may have more resources than we do. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their programs, services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student demands, testing materials, admissions standards, market needs or new technologies.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160; 

Since 1999, AEC NY has been devoted to international education exchange. AEC NY provides placement services to students wishing to study in the U.S., and also provides exchange services for qualified U.S. educators to teach in China. AEC NY currently has two representative offices located in Chengdu and Nanjing, and also operates one office in New York. The Company has signed contracts with representatives in Nanjing and Chengdu to set up its representative offices and registered with the local administration of industry and commerce effective from August 12, 2014 to August 12, 2019 and from February 17, 2014 to February 26, 2019 respectively. The Company has entered into cooperation contracts with business partners in Jiangxi, Shanghai and Shenzhen on May 29, 2014, June 10, 2014 and May 7, 2014, respectively to license its business partners to use the American Education Center business name and set up representative offices. However, as of today, we have neither set up our offices to start business operations in Jiangxi, Shanghai or Shenzhen nor registered with local authorities.

Marketing Strategies 

&#160; 

We employ a variety of marketing and recruiting methods to attract students, institutions and teachers. By doing so, we intend to continue fostering a standard corporate identity across our education network both in China and the US.

&#160;

We believe prospective students, institutions, and teachers are attracted to our services due to our excellent brand name, our personalized service model and the quality of our programs. We employ the following marketing methods to attract new students, institutions and teachers and retain existing customers:

&#160;

Referrals. Our student enrollments have benefited from, and are expected to continue to benefit from, word-of-mouth referrals by our current and former customers. We believe good service combined with referrals is a steady way to grow our business and reputation.

&#160;

Public Events and seminars. For several years we have successfully hosted the ESL (English as a Second Language) Annual Conference in China, which annually hosts over 500 attendees. The Company is planning to continue the annual conference this year. We plan to host marketing events in New York City to promote the Company&#8217;s services and brand name. In addition, the Company regularly attends higher education conferences held annually to further promote and market our services.

&#160;

Sponsor . We are proud sponsors of Chinese Student Associations in various higher education institutions in the Greater New York Area. We regularly promote our services to members and students of the various Chinese Student Associations and are regularly present at events held by such Associations. This is another steady source of business for us.

&#160; 

Marketing Materials . We plan to publish a &#8220;Chinese Visitors Guide Book&#8221;. It is planned to be a travel book with plug-in advertisements for the Company, which will assist Chinese visitors to the U.S. and simultaneously promote our services. We will also advertise in e-magazines, prepare and distribute brochures and present at exhibitions as part of our marketing strategy.

&#160;

Media and social media marketing. &#160; We plan to develop a mobile app in the future. We plan to open a business account named &#8220;AEC Elite 100 Club&#8221; with the popular smart phone instant messenger app Wechat. &#8220;Elite U.S. Club&#8221; will be a free service platform aiming to market our company and services to potential customers. Wechat users can subscribe to our personalized VIP services through their free accounts opened with &#8220;AEC Elite 100 Club&#8221;. The subscribers will receive rebates based on their membership levels, which are based on tenure. Our members can upgrade their membership by their cumulative consumption of services available through AEC Elite 100 Club.

&#160;

Acquisitions . Most importantly, the Company plans to engage in acquiring other education consulting Chinese companies in our industry or our competitors in China. Mergers and acquisitions will help the Company acquire a broader additional customer base, allowing us to generate more revenue. We hope to acquire such target companies by a combination of cash payment and issuance of equity in AEC Nevada.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Regulation of the Education Industry in the United States 

&#160;

Government authorities in the United States, at the Federal, state and local level, extensively regulate education and exchange student programs. Such regulations include, among other things, the regulations and policies of the United States Department of Education. However, unlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the Federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards. The establishment and grading of such standards has been left to state and local school districts.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A more formalized regulation is the requirement that a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. Foreign students must have a student visa to study in the United States. Visas generally require an application and an interview.

The Education Law stipulates that the government formulates plans for the development of education and establishes and operates schools and other institutions of education and, in principle, enterprises, social organizations and individuals are encouraged to operate schools and other types of education organizations in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. As such, no organization or individual may establish or operate a school or any other educational institution for profit-making purposes. However, according to the Law for Promoting Private Education, private schools may operate for &#8220;reasonable returns.&#8221;
