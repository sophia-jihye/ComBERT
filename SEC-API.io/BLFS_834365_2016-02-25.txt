&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Products and Services Overview 

&#160;

Biopreservation Media 

&#160;

Stability (shelf life) and functional recovery are crucial aspects of academic research and clinical practice in the biopreservation of biologic-based source material, intermediate derivatives, and isolated/derived/expanded cellular products. Limited stability is especially critical in the regenerative medicine field, where harvested cells and tissues, if not maintained appropriately at normothermic body temperature (98.6&#186;F/37&#186;C), or stored in a hypothermic state in an effective preservation medium, will lose viability over time. Chilling (hypothermia) is used to reduce metabolism and delay degradation of harvested cells, tissues, and organs. However, subjecting biologic material to hypothermic environments induces damaging molecular stress and structural changes. Although cooling successfully reduces metabolism (i.e., lowers demand for energy), various levels of cellular damage and death occur when using suboptimal methods. Traditional preservation media range from simple "balanced salt" (electrolyte) formulations to complex mixtures of electrolytes, energy substrates such as sugars, osmotic buffering agents and antibiotics. The limited stability which results from the use of these traditional biopreservation media formulations is a significant shortcoming that our optimized products address with great success. 

&#160;

Our scientific research activities over the last 20+ years enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the hypothermic and cryogenic (low-temperature induced) damage/destruction of cells through apoptosis and necrosis. This research led directly to the development of our HypoThermosol&#174; FRS and CryoStor&#174; technologies. Our patented preservation media products are specifically formulated to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Minimize cell and tissue swelling 

&#183; 

Reduce free radical levels upon formation 

&#183; 

Maintain appropriate low temperature ionic balances 

&#183; 

Provide regenerative, high energy substrates to stimulate recovery upon warming 

&#183; 

Avoid the creation of an acidic state (acidosis) 

&#183; 

Inhibit the onset of apoptosis and necrosis 

&#160;

A key feature of our preservation media products is their &#8220;fully-defined&#8221; profile. All of our cGMP products are serum-free, protein-free and are formulated and filled using aseptic processing, utilizing USP/Multicompendial grade or highest quality available synthetic components. All of these features benefit prospective customers by facilitating the qualification process required to incorporate our products into their regulatory filings and hence patient delivery processes. 

&#160;

The results of independent testing demonstrate that our biopreservation media products significantly extend shelf-life and improve cell and tissue post-thaw viability and function, which may, in turn, improve clinical and commercial outcomes for existing and new cell and tissue therapy applications. Our products have demonstrated improved biopreservation outcomes for a broad array of cell and tissue types including stem cells isolated from umbilical and peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, liver, tendon, and umbilical cord tissue, and also for induced pluripotent stem cells including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and neuronal cells, hepatocytes isolated from non-transplantable livers, chondrocytes isolated from cartilage, and dermal fibroblasts and muscle cells isolated from tissue biopsies. 

&#160;

Competing biopreservation media products are often formulated with simple isotonic media cocktails, animal serum, potentially a single sugar or human protein. A key differentiator of our proprietary HypoThermosol FRS formulation is the engineered optimization of the key ionic component concentrations for low temperature environments, as opposed to normothermic body temperature around 37&#176;C, as found in culture media or saline-based isotonic formulas. Competing cryopreservation freeze media is often comprised of a single permeating cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulfoxide (&#8220;DMSO&#8221;). Our CryoStor formulations incorporate multiple permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectant agents, which allow for multiple mechanisms of protection and reduces the dependence on a single cryoprotectant. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Across a broad spectrum of cell and tissue types, our products have proven more effective in reducing post-preservation and post-thaw necrosis and apoptosis as compared to commercial and home-brew isotonic and extracellular formulations. This results in greatly extended shelf life and improved post-preservation viability. 

&#160;

Biopreservation Media Opportunity 

&#160;

Regenerative Medicine 

&#160;

The emerging field of regenerative medicine is unique in its aim to augment, repair, replace or regenerate organs and tissue that have been damaged by disease, injury or even the natural aging process. This rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field is transforming healthcare by translating fundamental science into a variety of regenerative technologies including biologics, chemical compounds, materials and devices. It differs from other fields of medicine in the array of disciplines it brings together and in its ability to create or harness the body&#8217;s innate healing capacity. Most regenerative medicine therapies are working through the clinical trial process, with less than 50 approved therapies and over 500 clinical trials underway. 

&#160;

We continue to educate the regenerative medicine market about the impact of effective biopreservation on the ability to create commercially viable manufactured products with participation in scientific conferences and industry trade events by exhibiting, presenting scientific and business lectures, and sponsoring industry association events. We are a corporate or affiliate member of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the BEST Collaborative, and the International Society for Cellular Therapy. 

&#160;

In July 2015, Frost &#38; Sullivan forecasted that the stem cell therapy market is expected to be worth $40 billion by 2020 and $180 billion by 2030. Our addressable portion of the market is the demand for reagents used to store, ship and freeze source material and manufactured doses of cell-based products and therapies. We have secured a valuable position as a supplier of critical reagents to several commercial companies and estimate that our biopreservation media products are incorporated in over 200 pre-clinical validation projects and human clinical trials for new cell and tissue-based regenerative medicine products and therapies. A significant number involve CAR-T cells and other types of T cells and mesenchymal stem cells targeting blood cancers, solid tumors and other leading causes of death and disability. We estimate that annual revenue from each clinical application in which our products are used could range from $0.5 million to $2.0 million, if approved and our customer commences large scale commercial manufacturing of the biologic based therapy. 

&#160;

Drug Discovery 

&#160;

Our customers in the drug screening market are pharmaceutical companies that grow and preserve various cell types to measure pharmacologic effects and toxicity of new drug compounds, and also cell suppliers that provide preserved live cells for end-user testing in pharmaceutical companies. Our products specifically address this need by enhancing yield, viability and functionality of previously preserved cells. 

&#160;

Biobanking 

&#160;

The biobanking industry includes public and private cord blood banks, adult stem cell banks, tissue banks, hair transplant centers, and biorepositories. To continue to generate awareness of the need for effective preservation, we are a sponsor and member of the AABB and provide expertise when needed to the top biobanking enterprises. 

&#160;

Cold Chain Logistics Opportunity 

&#160;

Transporting biologic material, which is inherently fragile, requires precise control over temperature and other environmental conditions. Temperature excursions can impact the quality and efficacy of the product and/or the data generated for clinical trial evaluation. Suboptimal packaging and packout errors due to complex packaging are leading causes of biologic material temperature excursions. Despite this fact, biologic materials for clinical trial testing, as well as active drug substances, are regularly transported using packaging and temperature conditions that are suboptimal. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Often temperature excursions are not discovered because data is not being monitored in real time. While some clinicians use data loggers to track temperatures, these are often not reviewed until after a patient has received the therapeutic dose. We believe that real time monitoring is needed to ensure that patients do not receive doses that have experienced a temperature excursion that is outside the safety protocol, or that it has not been exposed to other damaging environmental conditions. 

&#160;

In clinical trials, where following protocols is so essential to obtaining meaningful results, maintaining the cold chain also preserves the validity of the tests. While it costs more to keep products at 2&#8211;8 &#176;C or at frozen temperatures than it does to keep them at uncontrolled ambient conditions, more to pack and transport them cold, and more to be able to demonstrate by process qualification or by measurement of each shipment that they stayed cold, we believe that industry and society benefit when temperature-sensitive drugs and biological products can be made in efficient large batches, shipped around the world, and delivered as needed to the point of purchase or use. 

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Commerce estimates that in 2015, $10 billion was spent on cold chain logistics of pharmaceuticals, with $7 billion for transportation and $3 billion for specialized packaging and instrumentation. BioLife's addressable market is comprised of the demand for small payload shipping containers and related temperature monitoring and location tracking devices. 

&#160;

Cold Chain Logistics Strategy 

&#160;

Our biologistex service addresses these needs with the combination of the evo Smart Shippers, designed for the shipment of materials which must be maintained at precision temperature ranges including frozen at -80&#730;C, chilled at 2-8&#730;C, and at controlled room temperature (CRT) temperatures, and an integrated cloud based application that provides real time GPS location monitoring and critical data on a number of payload and environmental conditions. 

Principal Products 

&#160;

HypoThermosol FRS biopreservation media is a novel, engineered, optimized hypothermic storage and shipping media product. This proprietary, optimized formulation mitigates temperature-induced molecular cell stress responses that occur during chilling and re-warming of biologics, intermediate products, and final cell products intended for research and clinical applications.

&#160;

PrepaStor &#174; is a flush solution specifically designed for use during the transitions from normothermic to mild hypothermic conditions (37&#176;C to 20&#176;C) to rinse culture media and native fluids from tissue and whole organ systems prior to suspension in a preservation solution. PrepaStor is also used to support the transition from hypothermic to normothermic temperatures following the preservation interval. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

biologistex TM cold-chain management service , launched in the third quarter of 2015, includes unlimited use of the evo Smart Shipper and the integrated track and trace cloud-based web application, mybiologistex.com. The line of evo Smart Shippers are reusable and designed for the shipment of materials which must be maintained at precision temperature ranges including frozen at -80&#730;C, chilled at 2-8&#730;C, and at controlled room temperature (CRT) temperatures. The evo Smart Shippers include a NIST traceable thermocouple embedded within the payload cavity to monitor the environmental conditions within the payload and a fiber optic sensor enabling monitoring whether the container is opened at any time during shipment, and upon arrival at the destination. The monitoring data and GPS location is transmitted in real time to our cloud based web application, giving our customers the ability to pack, ship, and independently track their precious starting material and manufactured cell products and other biologic material throughout transit to its destination. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Biopreservation Media 

&#160;

We believe that in-house formulated biopreservation media, whereby the user purchases raw ingredients and manually mixes the ingredients, satisfies the large majority of the annual worldwide demand. Commercial competitors, in most cases, are supplying isotonic, non-optimized preservation media and include VWR, Sigma-Aldrich, Lonza, Life Technologies, STEMCELL Technologies, and several smaller companies. Several of our competitors also distribute our premium products. These and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete. 

&#160;

We believe that our products offer significant advantages over in-house formulations including, time saving, improved quality of components, more rigorous quality control release testing, and improved preservation efficacy. We believe that a company&#8217;s competitive position in the markets we compete in is determined by product function, product quality, speed of delivery, technical support, price, and distribution capabilities. Our customers are diverse and may place varying degrees of importance on the competitive attributes listed above. While it is difficult to rank these attributes for all our customers in the aggregate, we believe we are well positioned to compete in each category. We expect competition to intensify with respect to the areas in which we are involved as the market expands and technical advances are made and become more widely known. 

&#160;

Cold Chain Logistics 

&#160;

Current commercial alternatives range from Styrofoam and EPS &#8220;beer cooler&#8221; type containers inside a cardboard box, up to and including vacuum panel insulation cartons, coupled with throw-in-the-box data loggers that are not able to monitor the payload conditions with the same level of precision and can be accidentally discarded at the destination. These alternatives provide inferior temperature stability performance due to the form factor design and/or materials used and do not provide real time monitoring. 

Traditional freight and &#8220;cold chain&#8221; shipper companies such as Sonoco Thermosafe, Cryopak, Pelican Technologies, and others maintain well-established positions in the marketplace, and possess significant financial, sales, marketing, and distribution resources in comparison. We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. In addition, there may be other companies which are currently developing competitive products and services or which may in the future develop technologies and products that are comparable, superior or less costly than our own. Additionally, some specialty couriers with greater resources currently provide transportation and may develop other products in the future, both of which may compete with our products. A competitor that has greater resources than us may be able to bring its product to market faster than we can and offer its product at a lower price than us to establish market share. We may not be able to successfully compete with a competitor that has greater resources and such competition may adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;
