Overview 

&#160; 

Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our marketed product ADCETRIS &#174; , or brentuximab vedotin, is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for three indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in more than 60 countries around the world, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. 

&#160; 

Beyond our current labeled indications, we and Takeda have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, including sALCL, and in other CD30-expressing malignancies. We and Takeda are currently conducting three phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS: ALCANZA, ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2. All of these trials are being conducted under Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreements with the FDA and pursuant to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency. An SPA is an agreement with the FDA regarding the design of the clinical trial, including size and clinical endpoints, to support an efficacy claim in a new drug application or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission to the FDA if the trial achieves its primary endpoints. 

&#160; 

Based on encouraging interim data presented at the December 2015 American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting, we recently announced a planned phase 3 clinical trial that is being designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, in previously untreated older acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patients. We are also evaluating SGN-CD33A broadly across multiple lines of therapy in patients with myeloid malignancies, including in ongoing and planned phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML patients and for newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, patients. 

&#160; 

In addition to ADCETRIS and SGN-CD33A, our clinical-stage pipeline includes five other antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, programs consisting of SGN-CD19A, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME, and an immuno-oncology agent called SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology. In addition, we have multiple pre-clinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD19B and SGN-CD123A, two preclinical ADC product candidates that we expect to enter clinical trials during 2016. 

&#160; 

We have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics; and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda; as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Agensys; and Genmab A/S, or Genmab. We also entered into a collaboration agreement in June 2015 with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer. 

&#160; 

Our Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Technologies 

&#160; 

ADCETRIS and our pipeline of clinical-stage monoclonal antibody-based product candidates utilize our ADC technology. ADCs are monoclonal antibodies that are linked to cytotoxic or cell-killing agents. Our ADCs utilize monoclonal antibodies that internalize within target cells after binding to a specified cell-surface receptor. Enzymes present inside the cell catalyze the release of the cytotoxic agent from the monoclonal antibody, which then results in the desired activity, specific killing of the target cell. 

&#160; 

A key component of our ADCs is the linker that attaches the cell-killing agent to the monoclonal antibody, which is designed to hold the cytotoxic agent to the monoclonal antibody until it binds to the cell surface receptor on the target cell and then to release the cytotoxic agent upon internalization within the target cell. This targeted delivery of the cell-killing agent is intended to maximize delivery of the cytotoxic agent to targeted cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Our ADCs use proprietary auristatins, which are microtubule disrupting agents, or pyrrolobenzodiazepine, or PBD, dimers, which are DNA cross-linkers, as cell-killing agents. The PBD dimer cell killing agent is stably linked to an antibody using our proprietary, site-specific conjugation technology, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody. We call this engineered antibody an EC-mAb. In contrast to natural products that are often more difficult to produce and link to antibodies, the cytotoxic drugs used in our ADC&#146;s are synthetically produced and easier to scale for manufacturing. ADCETRIS, SGN-CD33A (vadastuximab talirine), SGN-CD19A (denintuzumab mafodotin), SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, ASG-22ME (enfortumab vedotin), and ASG-15ME, as well as our SGN-CD19B and SGN-CD123A preclinical product candidates, each utilize our proprietary, auristatin-based or PBD-based ADC technologies. These technologies are also the basis of our corporate collaborations. We own or hold exclusive or partially-exclusive licenses to multiple issued patents and patent applications covering our ADC technology. We continue to evaluate new linkers, antibody formats, and cell-killing agents for use in our ADC programs. 

&#160; 

Our Sugar-Engineered Antibody (SEA) Technology 

&#160; 

Our proprietary SEA technology is a method to selectively reduce fucose incorporation in monoclonal antibodies as they are produced in cell line-based manufacturing. We believe that this may result in increased effector function and antitumor activity. Our SEA technology is a novel approach to modify the activity of monoclonal antibodies that is complementary to our ADC technology. 

&#160; 

A key feature of our SEA technology is that no genetic modification of the antibody-producing cell line is necessary and standard cell culture conditions can be used while maintaining the underlying manufacturing processes, yields and product quality. We believe the SEA approach may be simpler and more cost-effective to implement as compared to existing technologies for enhancing antibody effector function, most of which require development of new cell lines. 

&#160; 

SEA-CD40 is a clinical-stage non-fucosylated monoclonal antibody developed using SEA technology. Enhanced binding to effector cells results in crosslinking and activation of CD40 signaling in immune cells. We hypothesize that this increased stimulation of the patient&#146;s own immune cells may result in meaningful antitumor activity. We are developing SEA-CD40 as a novel immuno-oncology agent and a phase 1 clinical trial of SEA-CD40 for solid tumors is ongoing. 

&#160; 

Other Technologies 

&#160; 

In addition, we utilize other technologies designed to maximize antitumor activity and reduce toxicity of antibody-based therapies. Genetic engineering enables us to produce antibodies that are optimized for their intended uses. For ADCs, we screen and select antibodies that bind to antigens that are differentially expressed on tumor cells versus vital normal tissues, rapidly internalized within target cells and utilize native or engineered conjugation sites to optimize drug attachment. In some cases, we evaluate the use of our monoclonal antibodies and ADCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy and other anticancer agents, which may result in increased antitumor activity. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to become a leading developer and marketer of targeted therapies for cancer. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Successfully Execute our ADCETRIS Commercial Plan. An important near-term objective is to continue to execute our ADCETRIS commercial plan by driving market penetration and duration of therapy, consistent with the current ADCETRIS label. We continue to focus our efforts on commercializing ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing, reimbursement and market planning groups. In addition, as of January 31, 2016, ADCETRIS had received marketing authorizations in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and sALCL from regulatory authorities in more than 60 countries, and we are continuing to support Takeda&#146;s efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and conduct commercial launches in additional countries worldwide. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand the Therapeutic Potential of ADCETRIS. We believe ADCETRIS may have applications in earlier lines of therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and MTCL and in other types of CD30-expressing cancers. In this regard, in August 2015 we announced approval of ADCETRIS in a new indication by the FDA for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse or progression as post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or auto-HSCT, consolidation therapy. In addition, we have reported encouraging data and have ongoing clinical trials evaluating ADCETRIS in earlier lines of therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (the ECHELON-1 trial) and MTCL (the ECHELON-2 trial), as well as other types of CD30-expressing lymphoma such as relapsed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (the ALCANZA trial), peripheral T-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. Clinical trials are also being conducted by us, or collaborators and as investigator sponsored trials in different CD30-expressing indications, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL, salvage therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, novel combinations of ADCETRIS plus other anticancer agents or in combination with immune-oncology agents, in graft versus host disease and other areas of medical and scientific interest. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Evaluate SGN-CD33A Across all AML and MDS Patient Populations. SGN-CD33A is currently being evaluated in several clinical trials for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML patients and for newly diagnosed MDS patients. In addition, we have several additional clinical trials in these patient populations planned to begin in 2016, including a phase 3 clinical trial. The phase 3 study is being designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with HMAs in previously untreated older AML patients. SGN-CD33A was recently granted Orphan Drug Designation by both the FDA and the European Commission for the treatment of AML. FDA orphan drug designation is intended to encourage companies to develop therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to Develop our Other Pipeline Programs. We believe that it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of product candidates to sustain our future growth. To accomplish this, we are continuing to advance the development of our other clinical product candidates, particularly SGN-CD19A, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, SEA-CD40, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME, as well as SGN-CD19B and SGN-CD123A and multiple other preclinical programs and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. In addition, we have an ADC co-development agreement with Genmab that provides us with a future ADC product opportunity. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to Leverage our Industry-Leading ADC Technology. We have developed proprietary ADC technology designed to empower monoclonal antibodies. We are currently developing multiple product candidates that employ our ADC technology, including SGN-CD33A, SGN-CD19A, SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD70A, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME and multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We also license our ADC technology to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to generate near-term collaboration revenues and funding, as well as potential future milestones and royalties. Presently, we have active ADC collaborations with AbbVie, Bayer, Celldex, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, Progenics and Takeda, as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys and Genmab. These ADC collaboration and co-development agreements have generated over $325 million as of December 31, 2015 through a combination of upfront payments, research support, and other fees, milestone payments and equity purchases. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Support Future Growth of our Pipeline Through Internal Research Efforts and Strategic In-Licensing. We have internal research programs directed toward identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, creating new antibody engineering techniques and developing new classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents for our ADC technology. In addition, we supplement these internal efforts through ongoing initiatives to identify product candidates, products and technologies to in-license from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We have license agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation, or BMS, and the University of Miami, among others, which provide us with access to technology used in our commercial and development programs. We also have active research collaborations with other biotechnology companies and academic institutions to help advance our technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Enter into Strategic Product Collaborations to Generate Capital and Supplement our Internal Resources. We enter into collaborations to broaden and accelerate clinical trial development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. Collaborations can generate significant capital, supplement our own internal expertise in key areas such as manufacturing, regulatory affairs and clinical development, and provide us with access to our collaborators&#146; marketing, sales and distribution capabilities in specific territories. When establishing strategic collaborations, we seek beneficial financial terms and endeavor to retain significant product rights, particularly in the United States, Canada and Europe.

ADCETRIS 

&#160; 

ADCETRIS is an ADC comprising an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody attached by a protease-cleavable linker to a proprietary microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). ADCETRIS employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing cells. We believe that the CD30 antigen is an attractive target for cancer therapy because it is expressed on multiple types of cancer, but has limited expression on normal tissues. We are collaborating with Takeda on the global development and commercialization of ADCETRIS. Under this collaboration, we retain commercial rights in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. ADCETRIS has received regulatory approvals as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; United States . ADCETRIS for intravenous injection has received approval from the FDA for three indications: (1) regular approval for the treatment of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT or after failure of at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not auto-HSCT candidates, (2) regular approval for the treatment of classical HL patients at high risk of relapse or progression as post-auto-HSCT consolidation, and (3) accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. The relapsed sALCL indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for the relapsed sALCL indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Canada . Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance with conditions, authorizing marketing of ADCETRIS for two lymphoma indications: (1) the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of ASCT or after failure of at least two multi-agent chemotherapy regimens in patients who are not ASCT candidates, and (2) the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. The indications for ADCETRIS were authorized based on promising response rates demonstrated in single-arm trials. No data demonstrate increased survival with ADCETRIS. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; European Union . The European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorization of ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-expressing Hodgkin lymphoma: (1) following ASCT, or (2) following at least two prior therapies when ASCT or multi-agent chemotherapy is not a treatment option. In addition, ADCETRIS was indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. In January 2016, Takeda received an additional approval from the European Commission for retreatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL who previously responded to ADCETRIS and who later relapse. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Worldwide . As of January 31, 2016, ADCETRIS had received marketing authorization in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed sALCL by regulatory authorities in more than 60 countries. 

&#160; 

Required ADCETRIS Post-approval Clinical Study 

&#160; 

ADCETRIS was granted approval for the treatment of patients with sALCL after failure of at least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen under the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, which allows the FDA to approve products for cancer or other serious or life-threatening illnesses based on surrogate endpoints or on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Under the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS. In addition, we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements and the requirement to have our promotional materials pre-cleared by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Successful completion of our AETHERA trial has converted our accelerated approval to regular approval in the relapsed HL indication, and successful completion of our ECHELON-2 trial would result in conversion to regular approval for the relapsed sALCL indication. The ECHELON-2 trial, which is a required post-approval confirmatory study, is described in greater detail below under &#147;&#150;Clinical Development Plan&#148;. Failure to complete this required post-approval study or adhere to the timelines set by the FDA could result in penalties, including fines or withdrawal of ADCETRIS from the market with respect to the relapsed sALCL indication, unless we are able to demonstrate good cause for not completing the study or adhering to the timelines. The FDA may also initiate proceedings to withdraw approval if this post-approval study fails to verify the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS. Further, the FDA may require us to further strengthen the warnings and precautions section of the ADCETRIS package insert. Post-approval clinical studies similar to those required by the FDA are required in many other countries, including in Canada and the European Union. The requirements of these post-approval clinical studies vary from country to country and may in some cases involve testing in addition to the post-approval studies required by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 8,500 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are expected to be diagnosed in the United States during 2016, and an estimated 1,120 people will die of the disease. Approximately 1,800 additional patients per year in the United States are diagnosed with sALCL, a type of MTCL that expresses the CD30 antigen. The use of combination chemotherapy as frontline therapy for malignant lymphomas has resulted in high remission rates; however, these frontline chemotherapy regimens have substantial associated toxicities and a significant number of lymphoma patients relapse and require additional treatments including other chemotherapy regimens and ASCT. CD30 is also expressed at increased levels in many autoimmune diseases, which could potentially provide a non-cancer area for future development. For the reasons discussed in &#147;Item 1A&#151;Risk Factors&#148;, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals to market ADCETRIS for frontline Hodgkin lymphoma or MTCL, or otherwise continue to expand its labeled indications of use. 

&#160; 

Clinical Development Plan 

&#160; 

In collaboration with Takeda, we are pursuing a broad development strategy that includes clinical trials of ADCETRIS both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies for CD30-expressing cancers. These ongoing clinical trials include: 

&#160; 

Phase 3 Frontline Hodgkin Lymphoma (ECHELON-1) . We and Takeda have completed patient enrollment of approximately 1,300 patients in a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD versus ABVD as frontline therapy in patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, or the ECHELON-1 trial. We expect to report data from this trial in the 2017 through mid-2018 timeframe. The primary endpoint of this trial is modified progression-free survival, or PFS, per independent review facility assessment. Secondary 

&#160; 

endpoints include overall survival, complete remission rate and safety. The multi-center trial is being conducted in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. The study has enrolled patients who have histologically-confirmed diagnosis of Stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma and who have not been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The trial is being conducted under a SPA agreement with the FDA and also received scientific advice from the EMA. 

&#160; 

At the December 2012 ASH annual meeting, we announced interim results from a phase 1 dose-escalation combination trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma that evaluated ADCETRIS combined with ABVD or combined with AVD. Among the 25 evaluable patients in the ADCETRIS plus AVD cohorts, 24 patients who completed frontline therapy on study achieved a complete remission. At the December 2014 ASH annual meeting, we announced that in the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm, three-year overall survival was 100 percent and three-year failure-free survival was 92 percent. In the ADCETRIS plus ABVD arm, three-year overall survival was 92 percent and three-year failure-free survival was 79 percent. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in more than one patient overall noted in the ABVD and AVD cohorts, respectively, were neutropenia (80 percent, 77 percent), anemia (20 percent, 12 percent), febrile neutropenia (20 percent, 8 percent) and pulmonary toxicity (24 percent, 0 percent). One patient experienced a Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy event. Data from this phase 1 trial supported initiation of the ECHELON-1 trial. 

&#160; 

Phase 3 Frontline Mature T-Cell Lymphoma (ECHELON-2). In January 2013, we and Takeda initiated a global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP for the treatment of newly diagnosed CD30-expressing MTCL patients, including patients with sALCL and other types of peripheral T-cell lymphomas, or the ECHELON-2 trial. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS per independent review facility assessment. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, complete remission rate and safety. The trial is being conducted in North America, Europe and Asia. We expect to complete enrollment of approximately 450 patients in this trial during 2016, and to report data in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe. A molecular companion diagnostic test is being used in this trial to identify eligible patients based on CD30-expression. We are developing a companion diagnostic under a collaboration agreement with Ventana Medical Systems, or Ventana, and Takeda. The ECHELON-2 trial is being conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and also received scientific advice from the EMA. We are required to conduct this trial as part of our ADCETRIS post-marketing requirement for the relapsed sALCL indication, and the trial is designed to be confirmatory in the United States, Canada and Europe. 

&#160; 

At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we announced updated results from a phase 1 dose-escalation combination trial to evaluate ADCETRIS plus chemotherapy for sALCL, which was subsequently amended to include patients with any CD30-expressing MTCL. Interim data were reported from 26 frontline patients who received the combination regimen of ADCETRIS plus CHP and the updated findings are based on a median observation time of 38.7 months from first dose of therapy. Patients who achieved at least a partial remission with combination therapy were eligible to receive continued single-agent ADCETRIS treatment. The median age of patients was 56 years. Nineteen patients (73 percent) had sALCL, including 16 patients (62 percent) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative disease, typically associated with a poor prognosis. Seven patients had a diagnosis of other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL. The estimated three-year PFS rate was 52 percent, with no patients receiving a consolidative stem cell transplant. The estimated three-year overall survival rate was 80 percent. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 30 percent of patients were nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy (69 percent each), diarrhea (62 percent), fatigue (58 percent) and hair loss (54 percent). The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurring in more than 10 percent of patients were febrile neutropenia (31 percent), neutropenia (23 percent), anemia (15 percent) and pulmonary embolism (12 percent). Seventy-three percent of patients (19 of 26) experienced peripheral neuropathy, the majority of which was Grade 1 or 2. Ninety-five percent of these patients had complete resolution or some improvement of their symptoms at last follow-up with a median time to resolution of 1.3 months. Data from this trial supported initiation of the ECHELON-2 trial. In addition, ADCETRIS has been added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, guidelines for the treatment of relapsed CD30-expressing PTCL. 

&#160; 

Phase 3 Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (ALCANZA). In September 2015, we announced that we and Takeda completed patient enrollment in the phase 3 trial of ADCETRIS for relapsed CD30-expressing CTCL patients, or the ALCANZA trial. We expect to report data from this trial in the second half of 2016. The ALCANZA trial is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of ADCETRIS versus investigator&#146;s choice of methotrexate or bexarotene in patients with CD30-expressing CTCL, including those with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or pcALCL, or mycosis fungoides, or MF. The primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate, lasting at least four months. The key secondary endpoints are complete response rate, PFS and burden of symptoms. The ALCANZA trial enrolled 132 patients and is being conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA and also received EMA scientific advice. ADCETRIS has been added to NCCN guidelines for systemic frontline or later treatment of CTCL or mycosis fungoides. 

&#160; 

Relapsed or Refractory CD30-expressing DLBCL . In October 2015, we announced the initiation of a randomized phase 2 trial of rituximab and bendamustine with or without ADCETRIS in relapsed or refractory patients with CD30-expressing DLBCL. Bendamustine is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemias and lymphomas. The study is intended to evaluate the activity and safety of the combination regimen. In this phase 2 randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical trial, approximately 110 relapsed/refractory CD30-expressing DLBCL patients receive rituximab and bendamustine either with or without ADCETRIS every three weeks for six cycles. Patients in the ADCETRIS combination arm who respond to treatment with a manageable safety profile may continue to receive single-agent ADCETRIS treatment for up to 10 additional cycles. The primary endpoint is to compare the objective response rates between the two study arms. Secondary endpoints include PFS, complete remission rate, duration of response and overall survival. The study is being conducted at approximately 50 sites across North America and Europe. ADCETRIS is included in NCCN guidelines for patients with second-line or beyond CD30-expressing DLBCL. 

&#160; 

Frontline Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Age 60 and Over . In October 2012, we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ADCETRIS monotherapy as a frontline therapy for patients age 60 or older with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. The trial was subsequently amended to include the administration of ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine or dacarbazine. The phase 2 single-arm, open-label clinical trial is evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of ADCETRIS in patients age 60 or older with Hodgkin lymphoma. The primary endpoint of the trial is the objective response rate, with key secondary endpoints of safety and tolerability, duration of response, complete remission rate and PFS. At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we presented interim data from this study. ADCETRIS combination data were reported from 22 patients treated with dacarbazine and 20 patients treated with bendamustine. The median age of patients was 69 years in the dacarbazine combination arm and 75 years in the bendamustine combination arm. At least 70 percent of patients in each arm had stage III/IV disease at the time of diagnosis and the majority were frail with multiple comorbidities. Of 21 evaluable patients in the dacarbazine combination arm, all patients (100 percent) had an objective response, including 14 patients (67 percent) with a complete remission and seven patients (33 percent) with a partial remission. Of 16 evaluable patients in the bendamustine combination arm, all patients (100 percent) had an objective response, including 13 patients (81 percent) with a complete remission and three patients (19 percent) with a partial remission. In the dacarbazine combination arm, the median observation time was 13.4 months and PFS at six months was 95 percent, at nine months was 89 percent and at 12 months was 66 percent. In the bendamustine combination arm the median observation time was too short to provide a reliable PFS estimate. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 25 percent of patients in the dacarbazine combination arm were peripheral sensory neuropathy (77 percent); constipation (45 percent); fatigue and nausea (41 percent each) and joint pain and peripheral edema (32 percent each). The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in at least 25 percent of patients in the bendamustine combination arm were diarrhea (75 percent), nausea (60 percent), fatigue (55 percent) and decreased appetite and fever (40 percent each). Two patient deaths considered unrelated to treatment occurred within 30 days of last dose of study drug. Enrollment on the bendamustine arm was closed given the tolerability of the combination did not meet study goals for this fragile patient population. Patients in this arm continued to receive treatment with single-agent ADCETRIS. 

&#160; 

Second-line Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients . In June 2013, we initiated a phase 1/2 single-arm, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine in Hodgkin lymphoma patients after first relapse. Patients are eligible to receive up to six cycles of ADCETRIS in combination with bendamustine followed by additional single-agent ADCETRIS for a total of 16 cycles. As a part of the trial design, after patients receive ADCETRIS plus bendamustine combination therapy, they have the option to pause therapy to receive an ASCT and then resume treatment with single-agent ADCETRIS as consolidation. At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we presented updated data of 55 patients evaluable for response. The majority of patients (53 percent) had stage III/IV disease at the time of initial diagnosis, with 28 primary refractory patients (51 percent) and 27 relapsed patients (49 percent) after frontline therapy, primarily consisting of the chemotherapy regimen ABVD. Of the 53 evaluable patients, 49 patients (93 percent) had an objective response to combination therapy with ADCETRIS plus bendamustine, including 40 patients (76 percent) with a best response of complete remission and nine patients (17 percent) with a best response of partial remission. The complete remission rate was 88 percent in relapsed patients and 64 percent in primary refractory patients. The median overall survival for all 53 patients, including the 40 patients who received an ASCT, had not yet been reached. The estimated 18-month PFS rate was 75 percent for the 53 evaluable patients and 83 percent for the 40 patients who proceeded to ASCT. For patients who achieved a complete remission during combination therapy, the percentage of progression events was similar whether patients did or did not have an ASCT (21 percent versus 17 percent, respectively). Patients who did not receive ADCETRIS consolidation treatment experienced a higher proportion of PFS events compared to those who received consolidation therapy (29 percent versus 15 percent). The most common adverse events from combination treatment were infusion-related reactions, or IRRs, which were seen in 58 percent of patients. The most common symptoms associated with IRRs occurring in more than 15 percent of patients were fever, chills, dyspnea, flushing and nausea. The trial protocol was amended to require premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines, which decreased the severity of IRRs. Enrollment of this trial is now closed. 

&#160; 

Frontline Therapy for DLBCL Patients . In August 2013, we initiated a phase 2 study of ADCETRIS in combination with R-CHOP as frontline therapy in patients with DLBCL. Patients were randomized to receive standard dose R-CHOP with either 1.2 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) or 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS every three weeks. This study is evaluating the safety and antitumor activity of adding ADCETRIS to standard frontline therapy for DLBCL. At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, interim data were reported from 51 patients with a median age of 67 years. Seventy-one percent of patients in the trial had stage IV disease, 37 percent were considered high-risk and 63 percent were considered high-intermediate risk. Of 25 evaluable patients who had CD30-expressing disease (one percent expression or greater), 21 patients (84 percent) obtained an objective response, including 19 patients (76 percent) with a complete remission and two patients (eight percent) with a partial remission. The estimated PFS rate for CD30-expressing patients at both 12 and 15 months was 83 percent. Eleven patients with CD30-expressing activated B-cell like DLBCL had a complete remission rate of 73 percent (eight of 11 patients). The estimated PFS rate for these patients at both 12 and 15 months was 80 percent. Six patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoma had a complete remission rate of 83 percent (five of six patients). The estimated PFS rate for these patients at 12 months was 83 percent. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were fatigue and peripheral sensory neuropathy (63 percent each), diarrhea and nausea (57 percent each), and neutropenia and vomiting (37 percent each). The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (31 percent), neutropenia (33 percent) and anemia (24 percent). Based on an increased rate of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy observed in the first 10 patients treated on the 1.8 mg/kg arm, remaining patients were treated with 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS. Based on these data, the phase 2 trial has been amended to add a randomized cohort exploring the activity and safety of ADCETRIS plus RCHP (without vincristine) versus RCHOP in frontline patients with CD30-expressing high-intermediate or high-risk DLBCL. The study is expected to enroll up to 75 patients at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

Secondline Therapy for Hodgkin and B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Patients . In January 2015, we and BMS announced a clinical trial collaboration agreement to evaluate the investigational combination of ADCETRIS and BMS&#146; immunotherapy nivolumab (OPDIVO) in two phase 1/2 clinical trials. Nivolumab is a human programmed death receptor-1, or PD-1, blocking antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor expressed on 

&#160; 

activated T-cells. The first trial is ongoing and is evaluating the combination of ADCETRIS and nivolumab as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. The second trial, also ongoing, will focus on patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including DLBCL. 

&#160; 

Investigator-Sponsored Studies. In addition to our corporate-sponsored trials, as of December 31, 2015, there were more than 29 reported investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS in the United States. In addition, we and Takeda are reviewing proposals from multiple clinical investigators and cooperative groups in the United States, Canada and Europe about potential investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS. The investigator-sponsored trials to date include the use of ADCETRIS in a number of malignant hematologic indications such as CTCL, DLBCL, untreated limited stage Hodgkin lymphoma, salvage therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma prior to auto-HSCT and graft versus host disease. There are also numerous other investigator-sponsored trials for the use of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing and select CD30-undetectable settings, and in solid tumors such as mesothelioma and testicular germ cell tumors. One cooperative group investigator-sponsored trial is currently evaluating ADCETRIS with immuno-oncology compounds in Hodgkin lymphoma, and we expect additional investigator-sponsored trials might evaluate ADCETRIS in novel combination regimens. 

&#160; 

SGN-CD33A 

&#160; 

SGN-CD33A is an ADC composed of an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent PBD dimer using our proprietary ADC technology, and is a product candidate being developed as a potential treatment of AML and MDS. SGN-CD33A targets CD33, a protein that is expressed on most AML cells. SGN-CD33A employs our newest proprietary ADC technology. This technology is comprised of a PBD dimer, which is a potent cell-killing agent that works by a different mechanism than auristatins, linked to an engineered antibody called EC-mAb, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, we initiated a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SGN-CD33A as monotherapy or in combination with other standard treatments. The primary endpoints of the study are the estimation of the maximum tolerated dose and evaluation of the safety of SGN-CD33A. In addition, the trial is evaluating anti-leukemic activity, pharmacokinetics, PFS and overall survival in patients with CD33-positive AML. Patients who achieve a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete recovery, or CR/CRi, are eligible to continue to receive SGN-CD33A at a lower, maintenance dose given every three weeks. At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we reported interim data from a cohort of this trial that evaluated SGN-CD33A in combination with HMAs, including azacitidine and decitabine. Data were reported from 25 frontline older AML patients with a median age of 77 years and predominantly intermediate or adverse cytogenetic risk who had declined intensive therapy. Forty-eight percent of patients had evidence of underlying myelodysplasia. Of 23 efficacy-evaluable patients treated with azacitidine or decitabine combination therapy with SGN-CD33A, the best clinical response by investigator included 15 patients (65 percent) with a CR or CRi. Responses were observed in higher-risk patients, with remission achieved in eight of 10 patients (80 percent) with underlying myelodysplasia and eight of nine patients (89 percent) with adverse cytogenetics. At a median follow-up of 7.7 months, median survival had not yet been reached and 72 percent of patients remained alive and on study. The 30- and 60-day mortality rates were zero and four percent, with no treatment-related deaths occurring during that time. Ninety-six percent of patients (22 of 23) had reduction in bone marrow blasts, with 87 percent (20 of 23) experiencing a reduction of 50 percent or greater. The most common treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were fatigue (40 percent), nausea (32 percent), febrile neutropenia (28 percent), thrombocytopenia (24 percent) and neutropenia and anemia (20 percent each). The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in 20 percent or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (56 percent), thrombocytopenia (32 percent), neutropenia (28 percent), anemia (24 percent) and fatigue (20 percent). Based on interim data from this trial, a phase 3 clinical trial is planned to begin in 2016. The phase 3 study is being designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A in combination with HMAs in previously untreated older AML patients. We are also evaluating SGN-CD33A across multiple lines of therapy in patients with 

&#160; 

myeloid malignancies, including a planned phase 1/2 clinical trial for newly diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome patients. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we initiated a phase 1b clinical trial of SGN-CD33A in combination with standard of care chemotherapy, including cytarabine and daunorubicin, for patients with newly diagnosed AML. The trial will also evaluate SGN-CD33A in the consolidation setting for AML, both in combination with cytarabine and as a single-agent maintenance regimen. The study is a phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial designed to evaluate SGN-CD33A administered in combination with frontline standard of care regimens for induction (cytarabine and daunorubicin) and/or consolidation (cytarabine). In addition, the study will evaluate single-agent SGN-CD33A as a maintenance regimen. The primary endpoints are determination of the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of SGN-CD33A in these settings. In addition, the trial will evaluate anti-leukemic activity, pharmacokinetics, PFS and overall survival. The phase 1b trial is designed to enroll approximately 140 patients at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, we announced initiation of a phase 1/2 clinical trial of SGN-CD33A in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The trial will evaluate SGN-CD33A monotherapy as a pre-conditioning regimen prior to an allogeneic stem cell transplant, or alloSCT, and also for use as maintenance therapy following transplant. The phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, clinical trial is a two-part (A and B) study designed to evaluate the safety and activity of SGN-CD33A administered in patients with relapsed chemotherapy-resistant AML. Part A of the study will examine SGN-CD33A as cytoreduction pre-conditioning and Part B will evaluate SGN-CD33A in post-alloSCT as a maintenance regimen. Each part will consist of a phase 1 safety evaluation followed by a phase 2 expansion for activity. Parts A and B will enroll concurrently. The primary endpoints in phase 1 are determination of the maximum tolerated dose and the safety and tolerability profiles of SGN-CD33A in both pre- and post-alloSCT settings. The primary endpoints in phase 2 are to evaluate the one-year survival rates of patients treated with SGN-CD33A at the recommended dose pre- and post-alloSCT; to assess the rate of minimal residual disease negativity; and to further assess the safety and tolerability of SGN-CD33A at the recommended dose. The secondary endpoints include assessments of best response on study treatment, duration of response and overall survival. The two-part, phase 1/2 trial will enroll approximately 100 patients at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

SGN-CD19A 

&#160; 

SGN-CD19A is an ADC composed of an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology, and is a product candidate being developed as a potential treatment of hematologic malignancies. CD19 is a B-cell antigen that is expressed in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we announced the initiation of a randomized phase 2 clinical trial of SGN-CD19A in combination with the second-line salvage regimen of rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, or RICE, for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. In this phase 2 randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical trial, approximately 150 relapsed/refractory DLBCL or grade 3B follicular lymphoma patients who are eligible for an ASCT will be randomized to receive RICE either with or without SGN-CD19A every three weeks for three cycles. The primary endpoint is to compare the complete remission rates between the two study arms. Secondary endpoints include safety of the combination regimen, PFS, overall survival and the number of patients who are able to undergo ASCT. The design of this trial was based on the results of an ongoing phase 1 trial of relapsed/refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients who received single-agent SGN-CD19A every three weeks. At the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we announced interim data from this ongoing trial of 62 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL, including 54 patients with DLBCL, four patients with mantle cell lymphoma, and three patients with grade 3 follicular lymphoma. Of the 62 patients, 37 patients (60 percent) were refractory to their last therapy and 25 patients (40 percent) were relapsed. Sixteen patients (26 percent) had received a prior autologous stem cell transplant. The median age of patients was 65 years. The maximum tolerated dose was not exceeded after escalating to 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every three weeks. Of the 

&#160; 

60 patients evaluable for response, 23 patients (38 percent) achieved an objective response, including 14 patients (23 percent) with a complete remission and nine patients (15 percent) with a partial remission. Thirteen patients (22 percent) achieved stable disease and 24 patients (40 percent) had disease progression. Antitumor activity appeared to be higher in relapsed patients. Of the 25 relapsed patients, 15 patients (60 percent) achieved an objective response, including 10 patients (40 percent) with a complete remission. In the 23 relapsed patients who responded, median duration of response was 47.1 weeks. Among all relapsed patients, median PFS was 25.1 weeks and median overall survival was 56.7 weeks. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in more than 15 percent of patients were blurred vision (63 percent), dry eye (53 percent), and fatigue, keratopathy and photophobia (39 percent each). Ocular symptoms were reported in more than 70 percent of patients. Symptoms were mostly Grade 1/2 and were managed with steroid eye drop treatment and dose modifications. Eighty-eight percent of patients with Grade 3 or 4 keratopathy experienced improvement and/or resolution within a median of five weeks. 

&#160; 

In addition, at the December 2015 ASH annual meeting, we announced interim data from 72 adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia, or B-ALL, and highly aggressive lymphomas, including B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, or B-LBL, and Burkitt lymphoma. The median age of adult patients was 45 years and the median number of prior systemic therapies was two, with 20 patients (28 percent) having received a prior ASCT. The primary endpoints of the ongoing clinical trial are to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate the safety of SGN-CD19A. In addition, the trial is evaluating antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, PFS and overall survival. In this dose-escalation study, patients received SGN-CD19A in Schedule A (40 patients) at 0.3 to 3 mg/kg weekly or Schedule B (32 patients) at 4 to 6 mg/kg every three weeks. Of the 56 B-ALL adult patients evaluable for response, six patients (19 percent) treated weekly achieved a composite complete remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet or blood recovery) and nine patients (38 percent) treated every three weeks achieved a composite complete remission. The median duration of response was 27 weeks. Fifty-four percent of patients across both schedules achieved cytoreduction of greater than 50 percent. In the ten patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive, or Ph+ B-ALL, five patients (50 percent) achieved a complete remission and one patient (10 percent) had a partial remission. Ph+ B-ALL represents 20 to 30 percent of adult patients and carries a dismal prognosis, with higher rates of relapse and lower overall survival. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in patients treated weekly and was identified at 5 mg/kg in patients treated every three weeks. The most common adverse events of any grade occurring in 25 percent or more of patients treated weekly (40 patients) or every three weeks (32 patients), respectively, were nausea (63 and 41 percent), fatigue (58 and 47 percent), fever (55 and 50 percent), headache (45 and 38 percent) and anemia (43 and 22 percent). In the study, 43 patients (60 percent) developed ocular symptoms, of which 91 percent were Grade 1/2. These included blurred vision (39 percent), dry eye (25 percent) and photophobia (19 percent). Ocular symptoms were managed with steroid eye drop treatment and dose modifications. Keratopathy was observed in 34 patients, of whom 22 patients had Grade 3/4 events. The majority of patients with Grade 3/4 events had improvement or resolution with a median time of approximately four weeks. 

&#160; 

SGN-LIV1A 

&#160; 

SGN-LIV1A is an ADC composed of an anti-LIV-1 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology, and is a product candidate being developed as a potential treatment of LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer. In October 2013 we initiated a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of SGN-LIV1A in patients with LIV-1-positive metastatic breast cancer. The trial is enrolling patients with triple negative disease who have previously been treated with at least two prior cytotoxic regimens in the metastatic setting, or patients with ER-positive and/or PR-positive and HER2-negative disease who have previously been treated with at least two prior cytotoxic regimens in the metastatic setting, and at least three prior hormonal therapies. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety, with key secondary endpoints of objective response, duration of response and PFS. The study is expected to enroll up to 70 patients at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

ASG-15ME 

&#160; 

ASG-15ME is an ADC composed of an anti-SLITRK6 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. SLITRK6 is a novel target expressed in bladder and lung cancer. We are developing ASG-15ME as a potential treatment of bladder cancer under our co-development collaboration with Agensys. A phase 1 clinical trial of ASG-15ME for the treatment of bladder cancer was initiated in October 2013. This trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of escalating doses of ASG-15ME given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle. The maximum tolerated dose has not yet been established in this trial and dose escalation is continuing. We expect to report data from this trial in the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

ASG-22ME 

&#160; 

ASG-22ME is an ADC composed of an anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody linked to a potent auristatin compound using our proprietary ADC technology. Nectin-4 is a novel target expressed in multiple cancers including bladder, breast, lung and pancreatic cancers. We are developing ASG-22ME as a potential treatment of solid tumors under our co-development collaboration with Agensys. Based on the results of a prior phase 1 clinical trial of ASG-22ME, we initiated a new phase 1 clinical trial in 2014 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of ASG-22ME when given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. The maximum tolerated dose has not yet been established in this trial and dose escalation is continuing. We expect to report data from this trial in the first half of 2016. 

&#160; 

SGN-CD70A 

&#160; 

SGN-CD70A is an ADC composed of an anti-CD70 EC-mAb linked to a potent PBD dimer using our proprietary ADC technology. This product candidate is being evaluated in a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating SGN-CD70A for CD70-positive renal cell carcinoma. The primary endpoints are to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate the safety of SGN-CD70A. In addition, the trial will evaluate the antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics in patients with CD70-positive relapsed or refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The study is designed to evaluate SGN-CD70A administered every three weeks and will enroll approximately 95 patients at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

SEA-CD40 

&#160; 

SEA-CD40 utilizes our novel SEA technology to produce a non-fucosylated antibody targeting CD40, that is believed to work as an immuno-oncology molecule, activating certain immune cells. It builds on our extensive experience targeting CD40. In February 2015, we announced initiation of a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial of SEA-CD40 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed current standard of care treatments. Expansion cohorts are planned to evaluate SEA-CD40 across up to three cancer indications that will be determined based on data from the dose escalation portion of the study. The primary endpoints are determination of the maximum tolerated dose and safety profile of SEA-CD40. In addition, the trial will evaluate antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics and immunological pharmacodynamic effects. The phase 1 trial is designed to enroll approximately 50 patients during dose escalation and up to 90 patients in the expansion cohorts at multiple centers in the United States. 

&#160; 

Research Programs 

&#160; 

In addition to our pipeline of product candidates and antibody-based and SEA technologies, we have internal research programs directed toward developing new classes of potent, cell-killing agents and stable linkers, identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, and advancing our antibody engineering initiatives. 

&#160; 

New Cell-Killing Agents. We continue to study new cell-killing agents that can be linked to antibodies, such as the auristatins and PBDs that we currently use in our ADC technology, and new classes of cell-killing agents. 

&#160; 

New Stable Linkers. We are conducting research with the intent to develop new linker systems that are more stable in the bloodstream and more effective at releasing the cell-killing agent once inside targeted cancer cells. 

&#160; 

Novel Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen Targets. We are actively engaged in internal efforts to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules and ADCs with novel specificities and activities against selected antigen targets. We focus on antigen targets that are highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells that may serve as targets for monoclonal antibodies or ADCs. We may then create and screen panels of cancer-reactive monoclonal antibodies in our laboratories to identify those with the desired specificity. We supplement these internal efforts by evaluating opportunities to in-license targets and antibodies from academic groups and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as our ongoing co-development collaboration with Genmab. 

&#160; 

Antibody Engineering. We have substantial internal expertise in antibody engineering, both for antibody humanization and non-fucosylation, as well as engineering of antibodies to improve drug linkage sites for use with our ADC technology. By modifying the number and type of drug-linkage sites found on our antibodies, we believe that we can improve the robustness and cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing processes for conjugation of ADCs. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Expense 

&#160; 

Since inception, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop ADCETRIS, our product candidates and our antibody-based technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded $294.5 million, $230.7 million, and $218.6 million, respectively, in research and development expenses. 

&#160; 

Corporate Collaborations 

&#160; 

We enter into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement our internal pipeline. We seek collaborations that will allow us to retain significant future participation in product sales through either profit-sharing or royalties paid on net sales. We also license our ADC technology to collaborators to be developed with their own antibodies. These ADC collaborations benefit us in many ways, including generating cash flow and revenues that partially offset expenditures on our internal research and development programs, expanding our knowledge base regarding ADCs across multiple targets and antibodies provided by our collaborators and providing us with future pipeline opportunities through co-development or opt-in rights to new ADC product candidates. 

&#160; 

Takeda ADCETRIS Collaboration 

&#160; 

In December 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS, under which Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda and its Takeda affiliates have commercial rights in the rest of the world. As of December 31, 2015, we had received an upfront payment of $60 million and had achieved milestone payments totaling $50 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda. As of December 31, 2015, we were entitled to receive additional progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments of up to $185 million based on Takeda&#146;s achievement of significant events under the collaboration in addition to tiered royalties with percentages starting in the mid-teens and escalating to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takeda&#146;s licensed territories. Takeda also bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. Takeda is funding half of joint worldwide development costs under the collaboration, excluding costs solely related to development in Japan, which Takeda is solely responsible for funding. Although we are funding half of joint worldwide development costs, Takeda is responsible for the achievement of the progress- and sales- 

&#160; 

dependent milestone payments that we may receive. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us and we may terminate the collaboration agreement in certain circumstances. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party terminates the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the expiration of all payment obligations. 

&#160; 

Agensys Co-Development Collaboration 

&#160; 

In January 2007, we entered into an agreement with Agensys to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Agensys to proprietary cancer targets. Under this collaboration, Agensys is conducting clinical trials on various ADC product candidates. 

&#160; 

The co-development provisions of the collaboration agreement included an initial co-development product candidate, ASG-5ME, and provided us with two options to co-develop additional product candidates. We have exercised all of our co-development options and are currently co-developing ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME. Development of ASG-5ME has been discontinued. We and Agensys are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for both ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME, and will share equally in any profits from these product candidates. Both ASG-15ME and ASG-22ME are in ongoing phase 1 trials. 

&#160; 

Agensys has the right to develop and commercialize the other ADC product candidates on its own, subject to paying us annual maintenance fees, milestones, royalties and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the collaboration agreement. We are entitled to receive progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments of up to approximately $96 million based on Agensys&#146; achievement of significant events under the collaboration in addition to mid-single digit royalties on net sales of any of these other ADC product candidates by Agensys. Either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Subject to certain restrictions, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the other party. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of: (a) the expiration of all payment obligations pursuant to the collaboration agreement, or (b) the day upon which we and Agensys cease to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. 

&#160; 

Genmab Co-Development Collaboration 

&#160; 

In September 2010, we entered into an ADC research collaboration agreement with Genmab. Under the agreement, Genmab has rights to utilize our ADC technology with its HuMax-TF antibody targeting the Tissue Factor, or TF, antigen, which is expressed on numerous types of solid tumors. Under this agreement, we received an upfront payment and have the right to exercise a co-development option for any resulting ADC products at the end of phase 1 clinical development. Genmab is responsible for research, manufacturing, preclinical development and phase 1 clinical trials under the collaboration. We receive research support payments for any assistance provided to Genmab. If we opt into the anti-TF ADC product at the end of phase 1, we and Genmab would co-develop and share all future costs and profits for the product on a 50: 50 basis. If we do not opt in, then Genmab would pay us fees, milestones and mid-single digit royalties on worldwide net sales of the product. 

&#160; 

Unum Therapeutics Collaboration 

&#160; 

In June 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies incorporating our antibodies for cancer. Unum&#146;s proprietary ACTR technology enables programming of a patient&#146;s T-cells to attack tumor cells when co-administered with tumor- 

&#160; 

specific therapeutic antibodies. Through our research and development in the field of ADCs, we have a substantial portfolio of cancer targets and tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies from which programs will be selected for the collaboration with Unum. Under the terms of the agreement, we and Unum will initially develop two ACTR product candidates that combine Unum&#146;s ACTR technology with our antibodies, and we have an option to expand the collaboration to include a third ACTR product candidate upon payment of an additional fee. Unum is obligated to conduct preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 and we are obligated to provide funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 unless either company opts out. We and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits 50/50 on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales, if any. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to $615 million across all three ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 

&#160; 

ADC Collaborations 

&#160; 

We have active collaborations with ten companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology with their monoclonal antibodies. Under our ADC collaborations, which we enter into in the ordinary course of business, we receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress-dependent milestones and single digit royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. Our ADC collaborators are responsible for development, manufacturing and commercialization of any ADC product candidates that result from the collaborations and are solely responsible for the achievement of any of the potential milestones under these collaborations. 

&#160; 

Our current ADC collaborations are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development Our ability to generate significant growth in revenues from our current ADC collaboration agreements will largely depend on a product that incorporates our ADC technology entering late-stage clinical development and receiving marketing approval from the FDA at which point the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits become more substantial. Below is a table setting forth our active ADC collaborations and current development status: 

&#160;

&#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160; 

We have in-licensed antibodies, targets and enabling technologies from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs and ADC technology, including the following: 

&#160; 

Bristol-Myers Squibb. In March 1998, we obtained rights to some of our technologies and product candidates, portions of which are exclusive, through a license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Through this license, we secured rights to use various targeting technologies, including chemical linkers covered by patents owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, which incorporate technology covered by patents licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb. 

&#160; 

University of Miami. In September 1999, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami, Florida, covering an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody that is the basis for the antibody component of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of this license, we made an upfront payment and are required to pay annual maintenance fees, progress-dependent milestone payments and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, incorporating technology licensed from the University of Miami. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Technology 

&#160; 

Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to ADCETRIS, our product candidates, monoclonal antibodies, our ADC and SEA technologies and other antibody-based and/or enabling technologies. We commonly seek patent claims directed to compositions of matter, including antibodies, ADCs, and drug-linkers containing highly potent cell-killing agents, as well as methods of using such compositions. When appropriate, we also seek claims to related technologies, such as methods of using certain sugar analogs utilized in our SEA technology. For ADCETRIS and each of our product candidates, we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications. We maintain patents and prosecute applications worldwide for technologies that we have out-licensed, such as our ADC technology. Similarly, for partnered products and product candidates, such as ADCETRIS, ASG-22ME, and ASG-15ME, we seek to work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts, including patent application filings, prosecution, term extension, defense and enforcement. As ADCETRIS and our development product candidates advance through research and development, we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions, such as combinations, improvements to methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment. We also work closely with our scientific personnel to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our development pipeline. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. 

&#160; 

For ADCETRIS and our related ADC technology, we own nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2031. For SGN-CD33A and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to five patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2027 and 2030. Of these five patents, we own or co-own three patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For SGN-CD19A and our related ADC technology, we own ten patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2029. For SGN-LIV1A and our related ADC technology, we own or have licensed rights to six patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2026. Of these six patents, we own rights to four patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For SGN-70A and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to twelve patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2030. Of these twelve patents, we own or co-own ten patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For SEA-CD40 and our related SEA technology, we own or have licensed rights to eleven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2020 and 2030. Of these eleven patents, we own eight patents and have licensed rights to three patents. For ASG-22ME and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to eight patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2031. Of these eight patents, we own or co-own six patents and have licensed rights to two patents. For ASG-15ME and our related ADC 

&#160; 

technology, we own or have licensed five patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2033. Of these five patents, we own four patents and co-own one patent. In some cases, our U.S. patents may be eligible for patent term extension, and our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection in one or more countries. The length of any such extension would vary by country. 

&#160; 

Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of the corresponding patent application(s), the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and requirements for terminal disclaimers. Although we believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue. In the event of issuance, the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators. Our or our collaborators&#146; current patents, or patents that issue on pending applications, may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. Our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post-issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid, not infringed or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings or litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. Our and our collaborators&#146; patents may also be circumvented, which may allow third parties to use similar technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. 

&#160; 

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned, optioned by or licensed to us or to our collaborators. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS or to commercialize our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our or our collaborators&#146; ability to make, use or sell ADCETRIS or any other products. 

&#160; 

We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Our agreements with collaborators require them to have a similar policy and agreements with their employees, consultants and advisors. Our policy and agreements and those of our collaborators may not sufficiently protect our confidential information, or third parties may independently develop equivalent information. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries. 

&#160; 

Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary, depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors. 

&#160; 

The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, some of which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated at least annually with a report on development; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; development of a drug formulation and manufacture of the drug product for clinical trials, and commercial sale, if approved; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application in the form of a BLA, which must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless the fee is waived; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, compliance; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the marketing authorization application and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale. 

&#160; 

The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, and a clinical protocol are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may result in FDA not providing authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan 

&#160; 

for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually-identifiable information. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Since we received accelerated approval for ADCETRIS from the FDA for the relapsed sALCL indication, we are subject to certain post-approval requirements pursuant to which we are conducting an additional confirmatory phase 3 trial, the ECHELON-2 trial, to verify and describe the clinical benefit of ADCETRIS in the relapsed sALCL indication. Phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and efficacy in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov. 

&#160; 

The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a product&#146;s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA may also convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committee&#146;s recommendation. The submission of a BLA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDA&#146;s review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application, while priority review is eight months from submission of the application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. Accelerated approval of ADCETRIS for relapsed sALCL additionally requires the pre-submission of marketing materials to the FDA for the product until such time as the accelerated approval requirements have been fulfilled. Once an approval is issued, the FDA may require safety-related labeling changes or withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing of ADCETRIS, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of ADCETRIS, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of ADCETRIS based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 

&#160; 

Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the 

&#160; 

FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidances. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies. 

&#160; 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 

&#160; 

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 

&#160; 

ADCETRIS and certain of our product candidates may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by FDA&#146;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. For example, we and Takeda have formed a collaboration with Ventana under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a molecular companion diagnostic test with the goal of identifying patients who might respond to treatment with ADCETRIS based on CD30 expression levels in their tissue specimens, which companion diagnostic may be required by regulatory authorities to support regulatory approval of ADCETRIS in other CD30-expressing malignancies. 

&#160; 

Regulation Outside of the United States 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our collaborators are and will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales, manufacturing and distribution of our products. We must obtain approval by the regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as Canada, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Regulation 

&#160; 

Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws and regulations, may also be applicable to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to or approval by the federal government, including the Medicare, and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 

&#160; 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

&#160; 

The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

&#160; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and 

&#160; 

entities relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#146;s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#146; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

&#160; 

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#147;knowing failures.&#148; Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws and regulations that may be broader in scope than the aforementioned federal versions and apply regardless of payor, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts. Additionally, our business operations in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada and the European Union, may subject us to additional regulation. 

&#160; 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

&#160; 

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of ADCETRIS and any future products depend, in significant part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatment for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. A pharmaceutical product or procedure may not be reimbursed by third party payors based on a number of factors, such as a determination that it is experimental, not medically necessary, or not appropriate for a particular patient. 

&#160; 

Additionally, a third-party payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan by plan basis. One payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide 

&#160; 

coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160; 

Many of the patients in the U.S. who seek treatment with ADCETRIS may be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are administered by CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under these programs are subject to changes in CMS regulations and interpretive policy determinations, in addition to statutory changes made by Congress. Federal budget decisions have and may result in reduced Medicare payment rates. In addition, as a condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid, we are required to participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. The rebate amount under this program varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data we report to CMS. In addition, because we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we must make ADCETRIS available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration. This requires compliance with additional laws and requirements, including offering ADCETRIS at a reduced price to federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. We are also required to offer discounted pricing to certain private entities that are eligible for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act. Participation in these programs requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, as well as, administrative burdens and exclusion from or contract termination regarding these programs. The terms of these procurement contracts could change in the future which may increase the discounts or rebates we are required to offer, possibly reducing the revenue derived from sales of ADCETRIS to these entities. 

&#160; 

In some foreign jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA aims to, among other things, expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, PPACA is expected to, among other things, expand and increase industry rebates for products covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot yet predict the full impact of PPACA at this time for many reasons including that many of its provisions require the promulgation of detailed implementing regulations, which has not yet occurred. 

&#160; 

Many provisions of PPACA may impact the biopharmaceutical industry, including that in order for a biopharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to 

&#160; 

participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS. The required PHS discount on a given product is calculated based on the Average Manufacturers Price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children&#146;s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as PHS drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions, including the recently published AMP rule, to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required PHS discount to increase. 

&#160; 

PPACA and/or certain of its provisions may be modified or eliminated by future legislation or litigation. Many of the details regarding the implementation of PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that PPACA will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to PPACA in the future. 

&#160; 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% in each fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

&#160; 

Further, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers subject to this federal law will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers&#146; products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

&#160; 

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could have a negative impact on our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS or any future approved products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in 

&#160; 

developing various approaches to cancer and autoimmune disease therapy. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. 

&#160; 

With respect to ADCETRIS, there are currently no FDA-approved drugs other than ADCETRIS for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma or sALCL in its approved indications; however, Celgene&#146;s Istodax and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals&#146; Folotyn are both approved for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Compelling data have been presented involving several developing technologies, including antibody therapies that target PD-1 and CAR modified T-cell therapies, that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. For example, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s nivolumab therapy to treat patients with Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of auto-HSCT and ADCETRIS therapy. Merck is also developing a PD-1 inhibitor, pembroluzimab, in relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma. In addition, we are aware of multiple investigational agents that are currently being studied, including Pfizer&#146;s crizotinib, Takeda&#146;s alistertib, AbbVie&#146;s ibrutinib, and Gilead&#146;s idelalisib, which, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS&#146; three approved indications, including auto-HSCT, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single agent regimens. 

&#160; 

With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; advance our technology platforms; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; license additional technology; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; attract and retain key personnel; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; commercialize effectively; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; enter into additional collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

We are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, ImmunoGen and Pfizer, all of which have ADC technology. Pfizer is conducting a phase 3 trial of an anti-CD22 ADC for B-cell malignancies that may compete with our or our collaborators&#146; product candidates. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology 

&#160; 

companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGen&#146;s technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates. For example, we believe Bristol-Myers Squibb has anti-CD30 and anti-CD70 antibody programs, and Amgen and Xencor have anti-CD19 programs that may be competitive with ADCETRIS or our product candidates. In January 2016, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for AbbVie&#146;s venetoclax for use in combination with HMAs in treatment-na&#239;ve patients with AML who are not eligible for standard high-dose induction treatment, and venetoclax could be competive with our SGN-CD33A product candidate. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing. Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer and autoimmune diseases that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, Amgen, Bayer, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Infinity, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, Affimed, Karyopharm, MEI Pharma, Agios and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not currently have the internal ability to manufacture the drug products that we sell or need to conduct our clinical trials, and we therefore rely on corporate collaborators and contract manufacturing organizations to supply drug product for commercial supply and our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing the ADCETRIS product. For our ADC product candidates, multiple contract manufacturers, including AbbVie and SAFC, perform antibody and drug-linker manufacturing and several other contract manufacturers perform conjugation of the drug-linker to the antibody and fill/finish of the drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including shipping and storage of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. 

&#160; 

We established our commercial scale supply chain for ADCETRIS prior to commercial launch. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, vial and store sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. In addition, we depend on outside vendors for the supply of raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS. For our pipeline programs, we believe that our existing supplies of drug product and our contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate clinical trials through phase 3. However, we may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase our own manufacturing capability to meet our future commercial needs, both of which could require significant capital investment. In addition, we have committed to provide Takeda with their needs of certain parts of the ADCETRIS supply chain for a limited period of time, which may require us to arrange for additional manufacturing supply. We may also enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or larger biotechnology companies to enhance the manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates. 

&#160; 

AbbVie Biotechnology . In February 2004, we entered into a development and supply agreement with AbbVie (formerly a part of Abbott Laboratories) to manufacture developmental, clinical and commercial quantities of anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, which is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by AbbVie and the purchase by us of such anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement was made effective as of February 23, 2004 and will continue until the completion of the tenth contract year following commercial launch of ADCETRIS with automatic term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to 

&#160; 

the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 

&#160; 

SAFC . In December 2010, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with SAFC to manufacture commercial quantities of drug linker that is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by SAFC and the purchase by us of drug linker. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required drug linker from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The drug linker is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement was made effective as of December 1, 2010 and will continue until the completion of the tenth contract year following commercial launch of ADCETRIS with automatic term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 

&#160; 

Commercial Operations and Information About Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

We have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to commercialize ADCETRIS in the United States and Canada. We believe the U.S. and Canadian markets for ADCETRIS in the approved indications are addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, and we intend to continue promoting ADCETRIS ourselves in the United States and Canada for these and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. ADCETRIS was granted conditional marketing authorization in the European Union in October 2012 for patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed sALCL. We and Takeda have received marketing authorizations by regulatory authorities in more than 60 countries, and Takeda continues to pursue marketing authorizations in multiple other countries. 

&#160; 

We sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Health care providers order ADCETRIS through these distributors. We receive orders from distributors and generally ship product directly to the health care provider. Three of our major distributors, together with entities under their common control&#151;AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation&#151;each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our net product sales of ADCETRIS for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $226.1 million, $178.2 million, and $144.7 million, respectively. Revenues generated outside the United States as determined by customer location were less than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 759 employees. Of these employees, 539 were engaged in or support research, development and clinical activities, 115 were in administrative and business related positions, and 105 were in sales and marketing. Each of our employees has signed confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
