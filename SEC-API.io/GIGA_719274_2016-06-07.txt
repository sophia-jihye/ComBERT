 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Giga-tronics Incorporated (Giga-tronics, or the Company) includes the operations of the Giga-tronics Division and Microsource Inc. (Microsource), a wholly owned subsidiary. Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures and markets the new Advanced Signal Generator (ASG) for the electronic warfare market, and switching systems that are used in automatic testing systems primarily in aerospace, defense and telecommunications. 

&#160; 

Microsource develops and manufactures a broad line of YIG (Yttrium, Iron, Garnet) tuned oscillators, filters and microwave synthesizers, which are used by its customers in operational applications and in manufacturing a wide variety of microwave instruments and devices. Microsource&#8217;s two largest customers are prime contractors for which it develops and manufactures YIG RADAR filters used in fighter jet aircraft . 

&#160; 

In an effort to improve long term sales growth and profitability, Giga-tronics has embarked on a strategy of concentrating our efforts on the Giga-tronics Division&#8217;s newly developed ASG , and Microsource YIG RADAR filters. Giga-tronics has started to move away from the Giga-tronics legacy products. These products were developed ten to twenty five years ago, and have been steadily decreasing in both sales and gross margins. For example, we sold our SCPM line to Teradyne in 2013, and in December 15, 2015 we entered into an agreement for the sale of much of our power meter, amplifier and legacy signal generator business to Spanawave Corporation. Both of these transactions will allow us to increase our focus on the ASG and Microsource YIG RADAR filters. 

&#160; 

Giga-tronics was incorporated on March 5, 1980, and Microsource was acquired by Giga-tronics on May 18, 1998. 

&#160; 

The combined Company principal executive offices are located at 4650 Norris Canyon Road, San Ramon, California, and our telephone number at that location is (925) 328-4650. 

&#160; 

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

The Company has two reporting segments: Giga-tronics Division and Microsource. 

&#160; 

For more information regarding the Company&#8217;s two reporting segments, see &#8220;Part II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Significant Customers and Industry Segment Information.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Products and Markets 

&#160; 

Giga-tronics 

&#160; 

Our Giga-tronics Division produces modular signal sources, up-converters, receivers and down-converters in the AXIe format covering a radio frequency (RF) range of 100 megahertz (MHz) to 18 gigahertz (GHz). The Company also produces a 5-slot and a 9-slot AXIe chassis and a high-performance AXIe frequency reference module for use with its signal sources. Available within each product family are a number of options allowing customers to select specialized capabilities, features and functions. The end-user markets for these products can be divided into three segments: RADAR Target Generation, Threat simulation and Surveillance. These instruments are used in the design, evaluation and calibration of RADAR, Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and Direction Finding (DF) systems. 

&#160; 

The Giga-tronics Division also produces switching systems that operate with a bandwidth from direct current (DC) to optical frequencies. These switch systems may be incorporated within customers&#8217; automated test equipment. The end-user markets for these products are primarily related to defense, aeronautics, communications, satellite and electronic warfare, commercial aviation and semiconductors. 

&#160; 

Microsource 

&#160; 

Our Microsource segment develops and manufactures a broad line of YIG tuned oscillators, filters, filter components, and microwave synthesizers, which are used by its customers in operational applications and in manufacturing a wide variety of microwave instruments or devices. Microsource&#8217;s two largest customers are prime contractors for which it develops and manufactures YIG RADAR filters used in fighter jet aircraft. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the components required by Giga-tronics to make its assemblies are available from more than one source. We occasionally use sole source arrangements to obtain leading-edge technology or favorable pricing or supply terms, but not in any material volume. In our opinion, the loss of any sole source arrangement we have would not be material to our operations. Some suppliers are also competitors of Giga-tronics. In the event a competitor-supplier chooses not sell its products to us, production delays could occur as we seek new suppliers or re-design components to our products. 

&#160; 

Although extended delays in receipt of components from our suppliers could result in longer product delivery schedules for us, we believe that our protection against this possibility stems from our practices of dealing with well-established suppliers and maintaining good relationships with such suppliers. 

&#160; 

Patents and Licenses 

&#160; 

Our competitive position is largely dependent upon our ability to provide performance specifications for our instruments and systems that (a) are easy to use and effectively and reliably meet customers&#8217; needs and (b) selectively surpass competitors&#8217; specifications in competing products. Patents may occasionally provide some short-term protection of proprietary designs. However, because of the rapid progress of technological development in our industry, such protection is most often, although not always, short-lived. Therefore, although we occasionally pursue patent coverage, we place major emphasis on the development of new products with superior performance specifications and the upgrading of existing products toward this same end. 

&#160; 

Our products are based on our own designs, which are derived from our own engineering abilities. If our new product engineering efforts fall behind, our competitive position weakens. Conversely, effective product development greatly enhances our competitive status. 

&#160; 

We presently hold 31 patents. Capitalized costs relating to these patents were both incurred and fully amortized prior to March 27, 2011. Accordingly, these patents have no recorded value included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 26, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal 2016&#8221;) and March 28, 2015 (&#8220;fiscal 2015&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We are not dependent on trademarks, licenses or franchises. We utilize certain software licenses in certain functional aspects for some of our products. Such licenses are readily available, non-exclusive and are obtained at either no cost or for a relatively small fee. 

&#160; 

In September 2015, we entered into a software development agreement with a major aerospace and defense company whereby the aerospace company would develop and license its simulation software to us. The simulation software (also called Open Loop Simulator or OLS technology) is currently the aerospace company&#8217;s intellectual property. The OLS technology generates threat simulations and enables various hardware to generate signals for performing threat analysis on systems under test. We intend to license the OLS software as a bundled or integrated solution with our ASG system. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

&#160; 

Our business is not seasonal. 

&#160; 

Working Capital Practices 

&#160; 

We generally strive to maintain adequate levels of inventory and we generally sell to customers on 30-day payment terms in the U.S. and generally allow more time for overseas payments. Typically, we receive payment terms of 30 days from our suppliers. We believe that these practices are consistent with typical industry practices. 

&#160; 

Importance of Limited Number of Customers 

&#160; 

We are a supplier of microwave and RF test instruments to various United States (U.S.) government defense agencies, as well as to their prime contractors. Management anticipates sales to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors will remain significant in fiscal 2017. U.S. and international defense-related agencies accounted for 73% of net sales in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Commercial business accounted for the remaining 27% of net sales in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

At the Giga-tronics Division, U.S. defense agencies and their prime contractors accounted for 56% and 40% of net sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Microsource reported 98% of net sales to prime contractors of U.S. defense agencies in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, the Boeing Company accounted for 32% of our consolidated revenues and was included in the Microsource reporting segment. A second customer, Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) accounted for 11% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2016 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2015, Lockheed Martin accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenues. A second customer, the Boeing Company accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Both were included in the Microsource reporting segment. A third customer, DFAS accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment. 

&#160; 

In management&#8217;s opinion, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial stability if there was a significant loss of either our defense or commercial customers. 

&#160; 

Our Giga-tronics Division products are largely capital investments for our customers, and our belief is that our customers have economic cycles in which capital investment budgets for the kinds of products that we produce expand and contract. We therefore, expect that a major Giga-tronics Division customer in one year will often not be a major customer in the following year. Accordingly, our net sales and earnings will decline if we are unable to find new customers or increase our business with other existing customers to replace declining net sales from the previous year&#8217;s major customers. A substantial decline in net sales to the U.S. government defense agencies and their prime contractors would also have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations unless replaced by net sales in the commercial sector. 

&#160; 

Backlog of Orders 

&#160; 

On March 26, 2016, our backlog of unfilled orders was approximately $14.6 million compared to approximately 

$5.7 million at March 28, 2015. As of March 26, 2016, there were approximately $8.6 million of orders scheduled for shipment beyond one year, compared to $521,000 at March 28, 2015. Orders for our products include program orders from prime contractors with extended delivery dates. Accordingly, the backlog of orders may vary substantially from year to year and the backlog entering any single quarter may not be indicative of sales for any period. In April of 2016, Microsource received a $4.5 million YIG RADAR filter order that is not reflected in the backlog numbers above. In June 2016, the Gigatronics Division received a $3.3 million order from the United States Navy for our Real-Time Threat Emulation System (Real-Time TEmS) which is a combination of our new ASG Hardware Platform, along with software developed and licensed to us from a major aerospace and defense company. We expect to ship both orders throughout fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Backlog includes only those customer orders for which binding agreement exists, a delivery schedule has been agreed upon between us and our customer and, in the case of U.S. government orders, for which funding has been appropriated. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Giga-tronics serves two very different markets. 

&#160; 

The first is the electronic test equipment market with applications ranging from complex RF signal simulation used in the evaluation of military RADAR and Electronic Warfare systems to high performance signal switching used in the automated testing of commercial avionics. These applications represent niche segments within the broader test equipment market and their unique requirements allow Giga-tronics to win against a variety of larger competitors, such as Agilent/Keysight, Rohde &#38; Schwarz and Anritsu, by focusing our limited resources squarely on the specific features needed. We do not attempt to compete &#8216;across the board&#8217;, but selectively based upon our particular strengths, the competitors&#8217; perceived limitations, the customer&#8217;s needs and market opportunities. To maintain our position against competitors that have greater resources in research, development and manufacturing with substantially broader product lines and channels, we (a) place strong emphasis on maintaining a high degree of technical competence as it relates to the development of new products, (b) are highly selective in establishing technological objectives and (c) focus sales and marketing activities in the selected niche areas that are weakly served or underserved. Others competitors are of comparable size or have small product divisions with more limited product lines, such as Racal Instrument (a division of Astronics), VTI Instruments (a division of AMETEK), ELCOM (a division of Frequency Electronics Inc.), COMSTRON (a division of Cobham Plc) and EWST (a division of Ultra Electronics Plc). 

&#160; 

The second is the aftermarket for operational hardware associated with the US Government&#8217;s RADAR Modernization Program (RMP) for prior generation fighter aircraft. The F/A-18E, the F-15D and F-16 jets are receiving new RADARs to extend their useful lives. Giga-tronics&#8217; Microsource business unit supplies YIG filters specifically designed for military aircraft to solve interference problems. The prime contractors responsible for integrating the new RADARs have flight qualified our filters at considerable expense. Only a few companies possess the technical know-how to design and manufacture filters of this nature, such as Teledyne and Micro-Lambda Wireless, but the expense of requalifying a new component is prohibitive to the point where the integrator would only undertake such an effort when insurmountable technical deficiencies arose, which do not exist in this case. Microsource is the sole-source supplier of these filters and presently does not have any competition for this business. Microsource routinely maintains a &#8220;gold supplier&#8221; rating from its customers and received the Supplier of the Year award from one of the integrators. Microsource must maintain the Aerospace Industry&#8217;s AS9100C certification for its Quality Management System which it currently does. In October 2015, we announced a lapse in our AS9100C certification for our Supplier Quality Management System. In May 2016, our Microsource segment regained its AS9100C certification, during the lapse in certification we worked with one of the major customers to allow continued shipping and orders and we were pursuing a similar solution with the second customer, but this is no longer required since we regained certification. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Giga-tronics and Microsource sell their products primarily direct to end customers and prime contractors. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

Products of the type manufactured by Giga-tronics historically have had relatively long product life cycles. However, the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological changes at the component level. Our future success is dependent on our ability to steadily incorporate advancements in component technologies into our new products. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, product development expenses totaled approximately $2.8 million and $3.2 million respectively. 

&#160; 

Recent activities have focused primarily on the development of the new ASG product and the improvement of existing products. It is our intention to maintain product development at levels required to sustain our competitive position. Our product development activities are funded internally, through product line sales, or through outside equity investment and debt financing. Product development activities are expensed as incurred, except software development costs associated with the ASG. 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development. There can be no assurance that future technologies, processes or product developments will not render our current product offerings obsolete or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products that satisfy customer needs in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The assembly and testing of Giga-tronics Division and Microsource&#8217;s products are done at our San Ramon facility. 

&#160; 

Environment 

&#160; 

To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all Federal, state and local laws and regulations involving the protection of the environment. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 26, 2016 and March 28, 2015, we employed 63 and 71 individuals on a full-time basis, respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 

&#160; 

Information about Foreign Operations 

&#160; 

We sell to our international customers through a network of foreign technical sales representative organizations. All transactions between us and our international customers are in U.S. dollars.
