OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

COMPANY HISTORY 

&#160;

Gopher Protocol Inc., (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;Gopher&#8221; or &#34;GOPH&#8221;) was incorporated on July 22, 2009, under the laws of the State of Nevada and is headquartered in Perris, California. On September 9, 2009, the Company filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to provide for the registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. In the past, and continuing in the present to a limited degree, it had been principally engaged in offering consulting for foreign currency market trading to non-US resident clients, professionals and retail clients. The Company&#8217;s revenue to date was related to consulting services provided to one company in the foreign exchange business. Going forward, the Company is developing a real-time, heuristic based, mobile technology. The technology under development consists of a smart microchip, mobile application software and supporting software. The system contemplates the creation of a global network. Upon development, the Company expects that its microchip technologies may be installed within mobile devices or on SIM cards. The Company applied this technology into an electronic circuit including a proprietary microchip that is within a sticky patch package (the &#34;Patch&#34;). The Patch can be affixed to any object, mobile or static, which will enable the object to which it is affixed to be tracked remotely. It is our goal to allow the electronic circuit to communicate with other similar working patches via a separate, secured and private network. Upon affixing the Patch on an object, the circuit is turned on, after which the electronic circuit regularly transmits an identification signal in order to identify the device's geographical location. The Patch works in conjunction with a software application to provide tracking function operations. The system includes its own power source. The Patch will also perform an emergency feature. In the event of an emergency situation, one would simply peel the Patch off. Upon removing the Patch, it operates in a constant transmission mode, sending emergency signals. The Patch also alerts the user's friends and family about the user's location. No GPS or conventional network is needed.

General Overview 

&#160;

The Company is in the process of developing a real-time, heuristic based, mobile technology. Upon development, the technology will consist of a smart microchip, mobile application software and supporting software that run on a server. The system contemplates the creation of a global network, worldwide. Gopher believes this will be the first system that is developed using a human, heuristic based analysis engine. Since the core of the system will be its advanced microchip that will be able to be installed any mobile device, worldwide, Gopher expects that this will result in an internal, private network between all mobile devices utilizing the device by providing mobile technology for computing power enhancement, advanced mobile database management/sharing, and additional mobile features.

&#160;

The Company applied this technology into an electronic circuit including a proprietary microchip that is within a sticky patch package (the &#34;Patch&#34;). The Patch can be affixed to any object, mobile or static, which will enable the object to which it is affixed to be tracked remotely. It is our goal to allow the electronic circuit to communicate with other similar working patches via a separate, secured and private network. Upon affixing the Patch on an object, the circuit is turned on, after which the electronic circuit regularly transmits an identification signal in order to identify the device's geographical location. The Patch works in conjunction with a software application to provide tracking function operations. The system includes its own power source. The Patch will also perform an emergency feature. In the event of an emergency situation, one would simply peel the Patch off. Upon removing the Patch, it operates in a constant transmission mode, sending emergency signals. The Patch also alerts the user's friends and family about the user's location. No GPS or conventional network is needed.

&#160;

While developing the core technology of the Company, and relaying on prior knowledge, the Company developed Gopher Epsilon Software, which is an internal, proprietary platform that has been developed as a designated tool for the mobile industry to accelerate signoff Reliability Verification (RV) with Accurate and Precise Interactive Error Detection and Correction. The software is targeted to assist microchip designers to produce power-aware, faster performance and longer life span integrated circuits. Ultimately, the software significantly prolongs a battery's life, enabling mobile and static electronic devices longer operation time and better performance.

&#160;

The Company and its partners are preparing to introduce both of these new products to the market. The products will be presented for time-based license agreements utilizing a designated website on top of customary distributing channels for the product.

&#160;

To date, the Company, through Dr. Rittman, has filed for 16 different patents, as well as trademarks and landing pages that represent the Company&#8217;s intellectual properties.
