Our Company &#32; 

We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of performance sport boats, having the #1 market share position in the United States since 2010. Our boats are used for water sports, including water skiing, wakeboarding and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. Since inception in 1982, we believe we have been a consistent innovator in the powerboat industry, designing products that appeal to an expanding range of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts whose passion for boating and water sports is a key aspect of their lifestyle. We believe many of our innovations, such as our proprietary Surf Gate technology launched in 2012, expand the market for our products by introducing consumers to new and exciting recreational activities. We believe that our boats are increasingly versatile, allowing consumers to use them for a wide range of activities that enhance the experience of a day on the water with family and friends. While there is no guarantee that we will achieve market share growth in the future, we believe that the performance, quality, value and multi-purpose features of our boats position us to achieve our goal of increasing our market share in the expanding recreational boating market. 

We sell our high performance boats under two brands-Malibu and Axis Wake Research, or Axis. Our flagship Malibu brand boats offer our latest innovations in performance, comfort and convenience, and are designed for consumers seeking a premium boating experience. Retail prices of our Malibu boats typically range from $40,000 to $175,000. We launched our Axis brand of boats in 2009 to appeal to consumers who desire a more affordable product but still demand high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade key features. Retail prices of our Axis boats typically range from $45,000 to $95,000. 

&#32;Our boats are constructed of fiberglass, equipped with inboard propulsion systems and available in a range of sizes and hull designs. We employ experienced product development and engineering teams that enable us to offer a range of models across each of our brands while consistently introducing innovative features in our product offerings. Our engineering team closely collaborates with our manufacturing personnel in order to improve product quality and process efficiencies. The results of this collaboration are reflected in our receipt of numerous industry awards, including the Watersports Industry Association&#8217;s Innovation of the Year in 2010 and 2013. 

We sell our boats through a dealer network that we believe is the strongest in the performance sport boat category. As of July 1, 2016, our distribution channel consisted of 110 &#32;independent dealers in North America operating in 147 &#32;locations in North America and we had 58 &#32;independent dealer locations across 38 &#32;countries outside of North America, including Australia. Our boats are the exclusive performance sport boats offered by the majority of our dealers. Additionally, we believe that our Australia segment is the largest performance sport boat manufacturer in that country. Our dealer base is an important part of our consumers&#8217; experience, our marketing efforts and our brands. We devote significant time and resources to find, develop and improve the performance of our dealers and believe our dealer network gives us a distinct competitive advantage. 

Financial Information About Segments 

We report our results of operations under two reportable segments called U.S. and Australia segments based on their respective manufacturing footprints. Each segment participates in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of performance sport boats. The U.S. operating segment primarily serves markets in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia while the Australia operating segment principally serves the Australian and New Zealand markets. 

The segment and geographic information required herein is contained in Note 18 - Segment Reporting, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 

Our Market Opportunity 

During calendar year 2015, retail sales of new powerboats in the United States totaled $7.8 billion. Of the powerboat categories defined and tracked by the NMMA, our core market corresponds most directly to the inboard ski/wakeboard category, which we refer to as the performance sport boat category. We believe our addressable market also includes similar and adjacent powerboat categories identified by the NMMA, which totaled over $5.6 billion of sales in 2015. The following table illustrates the size of our addressable market in units and retail sales for calendar year 2015:

We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from trends in our addressable market, including: 

Improving Macroeconomic Environment Driving Increased Consumer Demand for Boats . Following the economic downturn, the recreational boating industry has grown and is projected to continue to recover. While domestic sales of new performance sport boats in 2015 grew to approximately 7,800 &#32;units, they remained 40% &#32;below the category&#8217;s 2006 sales volume of 13,100 . We believe there remains significant opportunity for growth from increased consumer demand in the recreational boating industry as the economy improves, but there are numerous variables that have potential to impact the growth to be achieved in the future, 

Increasing Ages of Used Boats Driving New Boat Sales . In 2015, according to NMMA retail sales data, new powerboats accounted for approximately one out of five powerboat sales in the United States compared to an average of approximately one out of four between 2002 and 2008. We believe the shift toward purchasing more used boats during the economic downturn helped cause the average age of powerboats in use to increase from 15 years in 1997 to over 21 years today. As the powerboat industry continues its ongoing recovery and older boats reach the end of their usable lives, we expect consumer purchases of new boats to shift back toward historic levels benefiting new boat manufacturers. 

Our Strengths 

#1 Market Share Position in Performance Sport Boat Category . According to SSI, we have held the number one market share position, based on unit volume, in the United States among manufacturers of performance sport boats for calendar years since 2010 including 2015. We have grown our U.S. market share from 23.3% &#32;in 2008, the year prior to the arrival of our current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to 32.0% &#32;in 2015. The following table reflects our U.S. market share in the performance sport boat category compared to the market share of our competitors for the periods shown:

In June 2015, Correct Craft acquired majority interest in both Centurion Boats and Supreme Boats. Accordingly, market share for Ski Supreme, Centurion, and Nautique are reflected combined here for all periods for better comparison. 

In addition, our 53% &#32;market share of performance sport boat exports to international markets for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016 was the highest among U.S. manufacturers and was more than our top two competitors combined. 

Performance Sport Boat Category Taking Share. As the recovery in the general economy and overall powerboat industry has continued, the performance sport boat category in which we participate has experienced one of the highest growth rates. New unit sales of performance sport boats in the United States increased by 16% &#32;from 2013 to 2014, while new unit sales of all other powerboats in the United States increased 6% &#32;over the same period. This trend continued in 2015, as new unit sales of performance sport boats and all other powerboats in the United States increased by 10% &#32;and 7% , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe this is largely attributable to increased innovation in the features, designs and layouts of performance sport boats, which has improved the performance, functionality and versatility of these boats versus other recreational powerboats, particularly the larger category of sterndrive boats. We believe that we have been at the forefront of product innovation and will continue to appeal to a broader consumer base that values our boats not only for water sports, but also for general recreational boating and leisure activities. We believe that our market-leading position within our expanding category will create continued growth opportunities for us. 

Poised to Take Advantage of the Performance Sport Boat Market Recovery. With our leading and growing market share in our category, we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the ongoing recovery in the powerboat market. While the performance sport boat category grew 10% &#32;in calendar year 2015, new unit sales still remain significantly below historical peaks. As illustrated in the chart below, the 7,800 &#32;new units sold in calendar year 2015 were 33% &#32;below the average annual new unit sales volume of 11,714 &#32;observed between 2001 and 2007 and 40% &#32;below the 13,100 &#32;new units sold in 2006. While there is no guarantee that the market will continue to grow or return to historical sales levels, we believe the continuing recovery in the performance sport boat market presents significant opportunity for growth. 

Even if the performance sport boat market does not reach previous peak levels, we believe that our #1 market share position in a category that is growing faster than the overall powerboat industry, our investments in our business during and subsequent to the economic downturn, including the acquisition of our Australian licensee, vertical integration efforts related to manufacturing our own towers, trailers, and other products, and our innovative product offering should drive superior performance. 

Industry-leading Product Design and Innovation. &#32;We believe that our innovation in the design of new boat models and new features has been a key to our success, helping us increase our market share within our category and generally broaden the appeal of our products among recreational boaters. As a result of the features we have introduced, we believe that our boats are used for an increasingly wide range of activities and are increasingly easier to use, while maintaining the high performance characteristics that consumers expect. Additionally, by introducing new boat models in a range of price points, sizes, bow and hull designs, and optional performance features, we have enhanced consumers&#8217; ability to select a boat suited to their individual preferences. Our commitment to, and consistency in, developing new boat models and introducing new features are reflected in several notable achievements, including: 

&#8226; 

release of our patented Surf Gate technology in 2012, which allows users to surf on either side of the boat&#8217;s wake, generates a better quality surf wave and was the Watersports Industry Association&#8217;s Innovation of the Year in 2013; 

&#8226; 

launch of the Axis brand of boats in 2009, designed from the ground up to be an entry-level product, which has already captured a 11.0% share of the U.S. market in our category as of December 31, 2015; 

&#8226; 

introduction of the patented Power Wedge in 2006, which gives boaters the ability to customize the size and shape of the boat&#8217;s wake with the push of a button. This was followed in 2014 with the Power Wedge II, which provides an even larger displacement and more control of wakes and waves than the original Power Wedge. It was integrated into our Integrated Surf Package to further provide a competitive advantage for wake surfing; 

&#8226; 

introduction of the first Malibu designed and manufactured tower in 2009; 

&#8226; 

integration of the manufacturing of our own trailers beginning with model year 2016, including full trailer design and construction which provides greater customization and quality control; 

&#8226; 

a strong new product lineup for model year 2016 that included the launch of the Malibu M235, Wakesetter 25 LSV, the Wakesetter 20 VTX and Axis A20. In addition, on our model year 2016 products, we offered an improved Surf Gate system with hydraulic actuators, our patented rider controlled Surf Band technology, new windshields, new vinyl and backup cameras; and 

&#8226; 

successful new model introductions each year. For model year 2017, we will launch four new models: the Malibu Wakesetter 24 MXZ, the Malibu Wakesetter 22 MXZ, and the Malibu Wakesetter 21 VLX were all launched in the summer of 2016 and an additional Malibu model will be launched this fall. 

Intellectual Property. A key element of our growth and increased market share has been our intellectual property which we believe is the best in our industry. Among our most innovative and sought after features on our boats has been Surf Gate. Together with Power Wedge and Surf Band, these patented technologies continue to drive demand for our products and increased margins. We vigorously defend our patents and other intellectual property to ensure we maintain our competitive edge. Because of the appeal of these technologies, we have entered into agreements to license them to other manufacturers within the powerboat category. We believe licensing our products provides us with significant strategic advantage over our competitors by allowing us to expand into other markets and broadening the appeal of these technologies into segments that would not otherwise have them thereby eventually creating a path to Malibu. 

Strong Dealer Network. &#32;We have worked diligently with our dealers to develop the strongest distribution network in the performance sport boat category. We believe that our distribution network of 147 &#32;North American dealer locations and 58 &#32;international dealer locations as of July 1, 2016 allows us to distribute our products more broadly and effectively than our competitors. For calendar year 2015, our dealers held or tied for the #1 market share position for the performance sport boat category in 71 of 118 U.S. markets. We have nominal dealer concentration, with no single dealer accounting for more than 5.3% &#32;of our unit volume for fiscal year 2016 &#32;and 4.7% &#32;for fiscal years 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and our top ten dealers represented 31.9% , 33.7% &#32;and 34.1% &#32;of our unit volume for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We continually review our geographic coverage to identify opportunities for expansion and improvement, and will, where necessary, add dealer locations to address previously underserved markets or replace under performing dealers. 

Highly Recognized Brands. &#32;We believe our Malibu and Axis brands are widely recognized in the powerboat industry, which helps us reach a growing number of target consumers. For over 30 years, our Malibu brand has generated a loyal following of recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts who value the brand&#8217;s premium performance and features. Our Axis brand has grown rapidly as consumers have been drawn to its more affordable price point and available optional features. We believe that the appeal of our high performance and innovative products with athletes and enthusiasts contributes to our brand awareness with dealers and with consumers. We are able to build on this brand recognition and support through a series of marketing initiatives coordinated with our dealers or executed directly by us. Many of our marketing efforts are conducted on a grass-roots level domestically and internationally. Key grass-roots initiatives include: production and distribution of water sports videos; online and social marketing; on-the-water events; athlete, tournament and water sport facility sponsorships; and participation and product placement at important industry events. Additionally, our boats, their innovative features, our sponsored athletes and our dealers all frequently win industry awards, which we believe further boosts our brand recognition and reputation for excellence. We believe our marketing strategies and accomplishments enhance our profile in the industry, strengthen our credibility with consumers and dealers and increase the appeal of our brands. 

Compelling Margins and Cash Flow. &#32;Our net income margin and adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.0% &#32;and 19.1% , respectively, for fiscal year 2016 . For the definition of adjusted EBITDA margin and a reconciliation to net income (loss), see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - GAAP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.&#8221; We also produced $35.6 million &#32;net cash from operating activities for fiscal year 2016 . We have an array of initiatives focused on reducing our cost base and improving the efficiency of our manufacturing process that have enabled us to maintain attractive margins and strong cash flows. We have re-engineered the manufacturing process in our Tennessee facility reducing labor hours per boat produced. We have also improved production throughput and product quality through close collaboration between our product development and manufacturing teams. Further, vertical integration of trailers, towers and tower accessories production gives us the ability to increase incremental margin per boat sold. In addition, our low capital expenditure requirements and a highly efficient working capital cycle have allowed us to generate significant excess cash flow from operations, excluding one-time litigation and settlement costs in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . We believe our strong cash flow increases our financial stability and provides us with more flexibility to invest in growth initiatives. 

Highly Experienced Management Team. &#32;Our experienced management team has demonstrated its ability to navigate through various economic cycles, to identify, create and integrate new product innovations, improve financial performance, 

optimize operations, enhance our distribution model and recruit top industry talent. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jack Springer, joined Malibu Boats in 2009 and has assembled an executive team with strong, complementary talents and experience. This team has led a workforce that we believe has produced superior results, including market share gains, sales growth and profitability improvement. 

Our Strategy 

We intend to capitalize on the ongoing recovery in the powerboat market through the following strategies: 

Continue to Develop New and Innovative Products in Our Core Markets. &#32;We intend to continue developing and introducing new and innovative products&#8212;both new boat models to better address a broader range of consumers and new features to deliver better performance, functionality, convenience, comfort and safety to our consumers. We believe that new products and features are important to the growth of our market share, the continued expansion of our category and our ability to maintain attractive margins. 

Our product development strategy consists of a two-pronged approach. First, we seek to introduce new boat models to target unaddressed or underserved segments of the performance sport boat category, while also updating and refreshing our existing boat models regularly. For example, we introduced Axis-branded boats starting in 2009 to address the entry-level segment of our category, we launched the Malibu Wakesetter MXZ product line in 2012 to enter the premium &#8220;picklefork&#8221; bow design segment of our market, and in 2016 we released the Malibu M235 designed to deliver luxury and performance in the ultra-premium market. Second, we seek to develop and integrate innovative new features into our boats, such as Surf Gate, Malibu Touch Command and Power Wedge. Over the past two years, we have continued these strategies by introducing eight new models, including three in the Axis line, and we have enhanced our optional feature offerings with the new Power Wedge II and the industry's first 12-inch touchscreen dash system. For the 2016 model year, which began July 1, 2015, we released the Wakesetter 25 LSV, the Wakesetter 20 VTX and the Axis A20 and in November 2015 we launched the Malibu M235. In addition, on our model year 2016 products, we offered an improved Surf Gate system with hydraulic actuators, our patented rider controlled Surf Band technology, new windshields, new vinyl and backup cameras. Furthermore, at the end of fiscal year 2015 we began production of trailers for the model year 2016 product, continuing our vertical integration strategy focused on delivering better quality and value to our consumers while enhancing margins. For the 2017 model year, we released the Wakesetter 22 MXZ, the Wakesetter 24 MXZ and the Wakesetter 21VLX. We intend to continue releasing new products and features multiple times during the year, which we believe enhances our reputation as a leading-edge boat manufacturer and provides us with a competitive advantage. 

Capture Additional Share from Adjacent Boating Categories. &#32;Our culture of innovation has enabled us to expand the market for our products by attracting consumers from other categories, most notably from the sterndrive category. As illustrated by the chart below, the new unit sales volume of performance sport boats steadily increased from 2001 through 2015 as a percentage of the total new unit sales volume of performance sport boats and sterndrive boats. While there is no guarantee that this trend will continue in the future, we believe our market-leading position and broad offering of boat models and features will continue to attract consumers to our performance sport boats. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue to enhance the performance, comfort and versatility of our products in order to further target crossover consumers seeking high-performance powerboats for general recreational activity. For example, we believe that one of our newest boat models, the Wakesetter 25 LSV, appeals to a broader range of recreational boaters by offering the performance benefits of our products, including superior drivability and water sports versatility, while also providing greater seating capacity, a roomy, plush interior and extensive storage space to allow an increased number of family and friends to spend time together on the water. In addition, in fiscal year 2016, we released a new line of boats in the ultra-premium segment anchored by the M235, which is designed to deliver luxury and performance in the ultra-premium market. 

Further Strengthen Our Dealer Network. &#32;Our goal is to achieve and maintain leading market share in each of the markets in which we operate. We continually assess our distribution network and take the actions necessary to achieve our goal. We intend to strengthen our current footprint by selectively recruiting market-leading dealers who currently sell our competitors&#8217; products. In addition, we plan to continue expanding our dealer network in certain geographic areas to increase consumer access and service in markets where it makes strategic sense. We believe our targeted initiatives to enhance and grow our dealer network will increase unit sales in the future. 

Accelerate International Expansion. &#32;Based on our U.S. leadership position, brand recognition, diverse, innovative product offering and distribution strengths, we believe that we are well-positioned to increase our international sales. Our 53% &#32;market share of performance sport boat exports to international markets for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2016 was the highest among U.S. manufacturers and is supported by an extensive international distribution network of 58 &#32;international dealer locations. Including our Australia operations which we acquired in October 2014, unit volumes outside of North America accounted for approximately 8.0% &#32;of our total unit volume for fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 . We believe we will increase our international sales both by promoting our products in developed markets where we have a well-established dealer base, such as Western Europe, and by penetrating new and emerging markets where we expect rising consumer incomes to increase demand for recreational products, such as Asia and South America, although there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that international sales will increase. 

Over the last few years we have taken a number of steps to enhance our international presence and our ability to drive sales in developed and emerging markets. In fiscal year 2013, we restructured our agreements with those parties to provide for direct 

sales coverage of key markets, including Central America, South America, Asia (excluding the Middle East) and most of Africa. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired our exclusive licensee in Australia. In fiscal year 2016, to better manage and optimize international sales in Europe, we have added dedicated company resources and increased our sales and marketing activity there, including international dealer meetings, dealer service schools, regional marketing campaigns and promotional visits by water sport athletes. We expect the growing demand for our product to continue, but the continued strength of the U.S. dollar has had an impact on international markets. 

Our Products and Brands 

We design, manufacture and sell performance sport boats that we believe deliver superior performance for water sports, including wakeboarding, water skiing and wake surfing, as well as general recreational boating. We market our boats under two brands: 

&#8226; 

Malibu , our flagship brand, dates to our inception in 1982, primarily targeting consumers seeking a premium boating experience and offering our latest innovations in performance, comfort and convenience; and 

&#8226; 

Axis , which we launched as a new brand in 2009, targets a younger demographic and provides them with a more affordably priced, entry-level boat that provides high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade key features. 

In addition, we offer various accessories and aftermarket parts. 

Boat Models 

We believe our boats are renowned for their performance, design, innovative technology, quality and ability to provide consumers a high-quality boating experience at varying price points.

Malibu M Series. The Malibu M235, created in 2015, is a new line of ultra-premium towboats, built from the ground up by a team of our designers, engineers, and athletes, and designed to provide consumers with a seamless blend of beauty, luxury, and power. The M235, at almost 24 feet, is deeper than any other boat in our category and loaded with every technologically innovative feature we offer including our Integrated Surf Platform, premium luxury interiors, and most advanced helm in the industry. Further, the M235 is driven by our most powerful engine delivering what we believe is the best performance of any performance sport boat on the market today. 

&#8226; 

Malibu Wakesetter. Introduced in 1998, the Wakesetter series is our premium boat series and the top selling series within the performance sport boat category. The Wakesetter series is designed for consumers seeking the highest-performance water sport and boating experience. Wakesetter offers consumers a highly-customizable boat with our most innovative technologies, premium features, newest graphics, color options and interior finishes. Demonstrating Wakesetter&#8217;s industry-leading performance and market position, the Wakesetter 23 LSV model was the best-selling boat in the performance sport boat category for fiscal years 2009 through 2015. 

&#8226; 

Malibu Response . The Response series, created in 1995, was designed for consumers who desire a high-performance water ski boat. Primarily because of its direct drive engine setup, the Response series produces the smallest wake of any of our boats and is designed to accommodate both professional and recreational skiers by allowing for a range of speeds and line lengths. Demonstrating Response&#8217;s reputation for high-performance and quality, the Response TXI model is the boat of choice for Regina Jaquess, a member of the Malibu Pro Ski Team since 2011 and the holder of the women&#8217;s slalom world record. 

&#8226; 

Axis . After the continued success with our Wakesetter series, we identified a market opportunity in entry-level performance sport boats and, in 2009, launched our Axis brand. We designed Axis for consumers who desire a lower price point, but who still demand high performance, functional simplicity and the option to upgrade their boats to have key features such as Surf Gate. The Axis series currently has five available models and we plan to refine these models continually as well as add new ones as we build out the brand. We believe the Axis series successfully provides consumers with a high quality water sport and boating experience at an attractive price, as evidenced by its #4 market position in the performance sport boat category after only seven years on the market. 

Innovative Features 

In addition to the standard features included on all of our boats, we offer consumers the ability to upgrade our base models by adding certain of our full line of innovative features designed to enhance performance, functionality and the overall boating experience. Our innovative features drive our high average selling prices. Some of these include: 

&#8226; 

Surf Gate . Introduced in July 2012 and initially patented in September 2013, Surf Gate is available as an optional feature on all Malibu Wakesetter models and Axis brand boats. Surf Gate has revolutionized the increasingly popular sport of wake surfing. Prior to Surf Gate, boaters needed to empty ballast tanks on one side of the boat and shift passengers around to lean the boat to create a larger, more pronounced surf-quality wake. By employing precisely engineered and electronically controlled panels, Surf Gate alleviates this time-consuming and cumbersome process, allowing boaters to easily surf behind an evenly weighted boat without the need to wait for ballast changes. Recent enhancements to Surf Gate have improved upon the system&#8217;s actuators, allowing for easier and faster transfer, as well as the installation of an indicator horn and optional light signaling, which alert riders to wave transfers. For the 2016 model year, we introduced our patented Surf Band technology that allows the rider to control the surf wave, shape, size and side. In 2013, the Watersports Industry Association named Surf Gate as Innovation of the Year. 

&#8226; 

Manual Wedge/Power Wedge . Our patented Manual Wedge and Power Wedge allow riders to customize their wakes by simulating up to 1,200 pounds of ballast weight in the transom of their boats. Used in conjunction with Surf Gate, wake surfers are able to customize the size and shape of the wave. The Manual Wedge is available on all Malibu and Axis brand boats. Unlike our Manual Wedge, the Power Wedge, available exclusively on our Malibu line, is fully automated and integrated within the Malibu Touch Command system, increasing functionality and ease-of-use for the driver. Re-engineered for model year 2015, we released the Power Wedge II. It features a larger foil and a 21% surface-area increase, which equates to an additional 300 pounds of simulated ballast, for a total of 1,500 pounds of wake-creating water displacement. In addition, a new upward angle increases lift, allowing the driver to achieve a fully loaded boat planing much faster. 

&#8226; 

G3/G4 Tower. Our G3 Towers, available on Malibu brand boats, are fully customizable with speakers, power lights and racks, enhancing the overall style, performance and functionality of our boats. Our G3 Tower can easily be folded down by one person with its weightless, gas spring-assisted design, making the G3 Tower safe and easy to store. We are the only manufacturer of performance sport boats that produces towers in-house, allowing us to control this critical design element of our boats. For model year 2015, we offered a new G4 Tower featuring aerospace aluminum and an internal honeycomb structure to provide the optimal strength-to-weight ratio, making the G4 three times more rigid than its predecessor. The new design contains automatic visible locks, a fully integrated wiring harness, Z5 Bimini compatibility, and zero pinch points. The new G4 has an aggressive design yet preserves ease of use by taking less than 30 pounds of force to lift, lower, and latch. 

&#8226; 

Electronic Dashboard Controls . Every boat in our Wakesetter series is equipped with our MaliView and Malibu Touch Command ("MTC") systems, which function as an electronic command center that enhances the driver&#8217;s experience by providing simple and quick control of all systems on board, including the Power Wedge and Surf Gate systems, rider presets, music, lighting and navigation. For the model year 2015, we were first to market with a 12-inch touchscreen. It joined our seven-inch MTC to form the display for our new Command Center, giving the driver endless data in an easy-to-navigate interface. Every major feature is on the home screen, menu paths have been streamlined and each component meets IP60 water-intrusion standards. Built with more processing power, higher levels of integration, a feature-packed new operating system and powerful wireless connectivity, the new Command Center represents the most advanced screen technology available on performance sport boats. 

&#8226; 

Surf Band. Malibu&#8217;s exclusive, patented Surf Band allows a rider to &#32; strap a buoyant, hi-viz wristband and tap a simple, intuitive remote interface to take command of all aspects of the rider's surfing experience. At the same time, the interface enables the driver to monitor the rider through alerts on the electronic command center, eliminating the need for hand-signals to the spotters or driver. If the rider is wakeboarding, the Surf Band lets the rider adjust the Power Wedge II and control speed. 

We also offer an array of less technological, but nonetheless value-added boat features such as gelcoat upgrades, upholstery upgrades, engine drivetrain enhancements (such as silent exhaust tips, propeller upgrades and closed cooling engine configuration), sound system upgrades, Bimini tops, boat covers and trailers which further increase the level of customization afforded to consumers. 

Our Dealer Network 

We rely on independent dealers to sell our products. We establish performance criteria that our dealers must meet as part of their dealer agreements to ensure our dealer network remains the strongest in the industry. As a member of our network, dealers in North America may qualify for floor plan financing programs, rebates, seasonal discounts, promotional co-op payments and other allowances. We believe our dealer network is the most extensive in the performance sport boat category. The majority of our dealers, including nine in our top ten markets, are exclusive to Malibu and Axis brand boats within the performance sport boat category, highlighting the commitment of our key dealers to our boats. 

North America 

In North America, we had a total of 147 &#32;dealer locations as of July 1, 2016. Of these locations, 19% &#32;sell our products exclusively, 63% &#32;are multi-line locations that only carry non-competitive brands and products and 18% &#32;sell our brands as well as other performance sport boat brands. Approximately 37% &#32;of our dealer locations have been with us for over ten years. For calendar year 2015, our dealers held or tied for the #1 market share position for the performance sport boat category in 71 of 118 U.S. markets. 

We consistently review our distribution network to identify opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and improve our coverage of the market. We have the ability to opportunistically add new dealers and new dealer locations to previously underserved markets and use data and performance metrics to monitor dealer performance. We believe our outstanding dealer network allows us to distribute our products more efficiently than our competitors. 

We do not have a significant concentration of sales among our dealers. For fiscal year 2016 , our top ten dealers accounted for 31.9% &#32;of our units sold and none of our dealers accounted for more than 5.3% &#32;of our total sales volume. 

We believe that our strong market position in each region of the United States will help us capitalize on growth opportunities as our industry continues to recover from the economic downturn. In particular, we expect to generate continued growth in the southwestern United States (which includes California), a region that experienced the most pronounced decline in sales of new performance sport boats and where we have our highest regional market share. The following graph provides a comparison of the number of units sold by U.S. geographic region during fiscal year 2006, when the market was generally at its pre-recession peak, and calendar year 2015, as well as our U.S. market share in the performance sport boat category for calendar year 2015:

International 

As of July 1, 2016, our extensive international distribution network consisted of 58 &#32;international dealer locations in 33 countries, including Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America, South Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. We service our independent dealers in the Australian and New Zealand markets through our Australian operations acquired in October 2014. Including our Australia operations, international unit volumes accounted for approximately 8.0% &#32;of our total unit volume for fiscal years 2016 &#32;and 2015 . 

&#32;For our international sales, other than Australia, we have historically relied, in part, on our relationship with an independent representative who serviced international dealer arrangements in Europe, the Middle East and South Africa on our behalf and was responsible for managing dealer relationships, dealer sourcing and account management, which included order management and customer service support in those countries. Under the terms of the agreement with the independent representative, the independent representative purchased boats directly from us at a predetermined percentage discount. These sales were made under the same terms and conditions offered to all dealers, which include, among other things, no right of return except in limited circumstances under our warranty policy. Like sales to our dealers, there were no continuing performance obligations in connection with our sales to the independent representative. Revenue from these sales has been recognized in accordance with our customary shipping terms, free on board shipping point. A fixed percentage discount was earned by the independent representative at the time a boat was shipped as a reduction in the price of the boat and recorded in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction in sales. 

To further our international expansion strategy, we ended our relationship with the independent representative during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 after several years of transitioning parts of the international market to a direct relationship with Malibu and its international dealers. Effective July, 1, 2016, we assumed direct management of Europe, the Middle East and South Africa from the former international representative. We believe this model will provide additional expansion opportunities which will lead to increased unit sales and more revenue over time. 

Dealer Management 

Our relationship with our dealers is governed through dealer agreements. Each dealer agreement has a finite term lasting between one and three years. Our dealer agreements also are typically terminable without cause by the dealer at any time and by us with 90 days&#8217; prior notice. We may also generally terminate these agreements immediately for cause upon certain events. Pursuant to our dealer agreements, the dealers typically agree to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

represent our products at specified boat shows; 

&#8226; 

market our products only to retail end users in a specific geographic territory; 

&#8226; 

promote and demonstrate our products to consumers; 

&#8226; 

place a specified minimum number of orders of our products during the term of the agreement in exchange for rebate eligibility that varies according to the level of volume they commit to purchase; 

&#8226; 

provide us with regular updates regarding the number and type of our products in their inventory; 

&#8226; 

maintain a service department to service our products, and perform all appropriate warranty service and repairs; and 

&#8226; 

indemnify us for certain claims. 

Our dealer network, including all additions, renewals, non-renewals or terminations, is managed by our sales personnel. Our sales team operates using a semi-annual dealer review process involving our senior management team. Each individual dealer is reviewed semi-annually with a broad assessment across multiple key elements, including the dealer&#8217;s geographic region, market share and customer service ratings, to identify underperforming dealers for remediation and to manage the transition process when non-renewal or termination is a necessary step. 

We have developed a system of financial incentives for our dealers based on customer satisfaction and achievement of best practices. Our dealer incentive program has been refined through nearly 30 years of experience and provides the following key elements: 

&#8226; 

Rebates . Our dealers agree to an annual commitment volume that places each dealer into a certain rebate tier and determines its prospective rebate percentage. If a dealer meets its annual commitment volume as well as other terms of the rebate program, the dealer is entitled to the specified rebate. Failure to meet the commitment volume may result in partial or complete forfeiture of the dealer&#8217;s rebate. 

&#8226; 

Co-op . Dealers of the Malibu product line may earn certain co-op reimbursements upon reaching a specified level of qualifying expenditures. 

&#8226; 

Free flooring . Our dealers that take delivery of current model year boats in the offseason, typically July through April, are entitled to have us pay the interest to floor the boat until the earlier of (1) the sale of the unit or (2) a date near the end of the current model year. This program is an additional incentive to encourage dealers to order in the offseason and helps us balance our seasonal production. 

Our dealer incentive programs are also structured to promote more evenly distributed ordering throughout the fiscal year, which allows us to achieve better level-loading of our production and thereby generate plant operating efficiencies. In addition, these programs offer further rewards for dealers who are exclusive to Malibu and Axis in our performance sport boat category. 

Floor Plan Financing 

Our North American dealers often purchase boats through floor plan financing programs with third-party floor plan financing providers. During fiscal year 2016 , approximately 87% of our domestic shipments were made pursuant to floor plan financing programs through which our dealers participate. These programs allow dealers to establish lines of credit with third-party lenders to purchase inventory. Under these programs, a dealer draws on the floor plan facility upon the purchase of our boats and the lender pays the invoice price of the boats. As is typical in our industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with certain floor plan financing providers to our dealers. Under the terms of these arrangements, in the event a lender repossesses a boat from a dealer that has defaulted on its floor financing arrangement and is able to deliver the repossessed boat to us, we are obligated to repurchase the boat from the lender. Our obligation to repurchase such repossessed products for the unpaid balance of our original invoice price for the boat is subject to reduction or limitation based on the age and condition of the boat at the time of repurchase, and in certain cases by an aggregate cap on repurchase obligations associated with a particular floor financing program. 

Our exposure under repurchase agreements with third-party lenders is mitigated by our ability to reposition inventory with a new dealer in the event that a repurchase event occurs. The primary cost to us of a repurchase event is any loss on the resale 

of a repurchased unit, which is often less than 10% of the repurchase amount. For fiscal year 2016 , we agreed to repurchase three units from the lender of two of our former dealers. Other than these repurchase commitments, the Company has not repurchased any boats under our repurchase agreements since July 1, 2010. 

Marketing and Sales 

We believe that providing a high level of service to our dealers and end consumers is essential to maintaining our reputation. Our sales personnel receive training on the latest Malibu Boats products and technologies, as well as training on our competitors&#8217; products and technologies, and attend trade shows to increase their market knowledge. This training is then passed along to our dealers to ensure a consistent marketing message and leverage our marketing expenditures. We enjoy strong brand awareness, as evidenced by our substantial market share. 

Our marketing strategy focuses on strengthening and promoting the Malibu and Axis brands in the performance sport boat marketplace. One element of our marketing strategy involves specialized promotions at competitive water sports events, and individual and team sponsorships. Our leading position in the performance sport boat category is supported by our sponsorship of some of the most prestigious water sports competitions, including the Malibu Evolution Pro Series, Malibu Open and World Wakeboard Association Riders Experience, which we believe positively influences the purchasing habits of enthusiasts and other consumers seeking high-performance products. These events feature the most popular figures in water sports, drawing large audiences of enthusiasts to a variety of sites around the country. Further, these events are focused on fan and retail consumer engagement and offer interactive, experiential opportunities for consumers to experience watersports behind our product. To aid in driving brand awareness we also sponsor a team of elite male and female athletes from the professional water sports tours. Team Malibu includes legendary wakeboarders such Ralph Derome and Amber Wing, along with World Wakeskate Champion and two-time Masters Champion Brian Grubbs. Additionally leading members of the team are World Champion waterskiers Thomas Degasperi and World Record Holder Regina Jaquess. The Axis Wake Research Pro Team includes watersports legends like Brostock Champion, Video of the Year winner, Randall Harris and King of the Cable, Best Wake Park Rider, and Wake Park World Series Champion Tom Fooshee. We believe that the performance of our products has been demonstrated by, and our brands benefit from, the success of professional athletes who use our products. 

In addition to our website and traditional marketing channels, such as print advertising and tradeshows, we maintain an active digital advertising and social media platform, including use of Facebook and Twitter to increase brand awareness, foster loyalty and build a community of users. In addition, we benefit from the various Malibu and Axis user-generated videos and photos that are uploaded to websites including YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram. As strategies and marketing plans are developed for our products, our internal marketing and communications group works to ensure brand cohesion and consistency. We believe that our marketing initiatives, as well as our strategic focus on product innovation, performance and quality attracts aspiring and enthusiast consumers to our brands and products. 

Product Development and Engineering 

We are strategically and financially committed to innovation, as reflected in our dedicated product development and engineering group and evidenced by our track record of new product introduction. Our product development and engineering group spans both our Tennessee headquarters and our California facility and comprises 18 professionals. These individuals bring to our product development efforts significant expertise across core disciplines, including boat design, trailer design, computer-aided design, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. They are responsible for execution of all facets of our new product strategy, including designing new and refreshed boat models and new features, engineering these designs for manufacturing and integrating new features into our boats. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are actively involved in the product development process and integration into manufacturing. 

We take a disciplined approach to the management of our product development strategy. We use a formalized phase gate process, overseen by a dedicated project manager, to develop, evaluate and implement new product ideas for both boat models and innovative features. Application of the phase gate process requires management to establish an overall timeline that is sub-divided into milestones, or &#8220;gates,&#8221; for product development. Setting milestones at certain intervals in the product development process ensures that each phase of development occurs in an organized manner and enables management to become aware of and address any issues in timely fashion, which facilitates on-time, on-target release of new products with expected return on investment. Extensive testing and coordination with our manufacturing group are important elements of our product development process, which we believe enable us to minimize the risk associated with the release of new products. Our phase gate process also facilitates our introduction of new boat models and features throughout the year, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Finally, in addition to our process for managing new product introductions in a given fiscal year, we also engage in longer-term product life cycle and product portfolio planning. 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing efforts are led by our Chief Operating Officer, who brings 30 years of experience in the manufacture of performance sport boats. We manufacture our boats at both our Tennessee and Australia facilities, and we manufacture towers, tower accessories and stainless steel and aluminum billet at our California facility. Beginning with model year 2016, we began manufacturing our own trailers at our Tennessee facility. 

Our boats are built through a continuous flow manufacturing process that encompasses fabrication, assembly, quality management and testing. Each boat is produced over a seven-day cycle that includes the fabrication of the hull and deck through gelcoat application and fiberglass lamination, grinding and hole cutting, installation of components, rigging, finishing, detailing and on-the-water testing. Trailers are also produced in a continuous flow manufacturing process involving cutting and bending of the main frame from raw top grade carbon steel, painting using our state of the art system and installation of components. We manufacture certain components and subassemblies for our boats, such as upholstery, stainless steel and aluminum billet and towers. We procure other components, such as engines and electronic controls, from third-party vendors and install them on the boat. 

We acquired our tower and tower accessory manufacturing capability in 2009 through the acquisition of certain assets of Titan Wake Accessories, which had been one of our suppliers. Tower-related manufacturing occurs in our Merced-based machine shop, where we use multiple computer-controlled machines to cut all of the aluminum parts required for tower assembly. We are the only performance sport boat company that manufacturers towers in-house. We believe that the vertical integration of these components is a distinct competitive advantage that allows us to control key design elements of our boats and generate higher margins. 

We are committed to continuous improvement in our operations, and our efforts in this regard have resulted in higher gross margins. Specifically, we have increased labor efficiency, reduced cost of materials and reduced warranty claims. Our production engineers evaluate and seek to optimize the configuration of our production line given our production volumes and model mix. We use disciplined mold maintenance procedures to maintain the usable life of our molds and to reduce surface defects that would require rework. We have instituted scrap material reduction and recovery processes, both internally and with our supplier base, helping to manage our material costs. Finally, we have implemented a quality management system to ensure that proper procedures and control measures are in place to deliver consistent, high-quality product, especially as our production volumes have increased. 

We focus on worker safety in our operations. From July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2016, we recorded 2,601,211 consecutive man-hours with only one lost-time accident in our Tennessee facility, an accomplishment that has reduced workers&#8217; compensation claims and warranty costs, as our most experienced employees continue to remain on the job. 

Suppliers 

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including resins, fiberglass, hydrocarbon feedstocks and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engines and electronic controls, through a sales order process. 

We belong to Independent Boat Buildings, Inc., or IBBI, a 20-member marine purchasing cooperative and sit on its board of directors. Membership in IBBI is limited to top-tier manufacturers and is not only helpful for procuring materials, but also helps us stay abreast of technological developments and industry best practices. Although we purchase certain supplies, such as fiberglass and resins, through the IBBI cooperative agreement, we maintain informal arrangements with third-party suppliers outside of the IBBI agreement for other raw materials and components, which we believe ensures that our boats are constructed using the best available components and raw materials. 

We have not experienced any material shortages in any of our raw materials, product parts or components. Temporary shortages, when they do occur, usually involve manufacturers of these products adjusting model mixes, introducing new product lines or limiting production in response to an industry-wide reduction in boat demand. 

The most significant component used in manufacturing our boats, based on cost, are engines. We maintain a strong and long-standing relationship with our primary supplier of engines from whom we purchased approximately 60% of our engines for fiscal year 2016, and we have also developed a relationship with a second supplier from whom we sourced approximately 40% of our engines for fiscal year 2016. As is typical in our industry, our engine suppliers are marinizers of engines that they procure from larger engine block manufacturers, such as General Motors Corporation. 

Insurance and Product Warranties 

We carry various insurance policies, including policies to cover general products liability, workers&#8217; compensation and other casualty and property risks, to protect against certain risks of loss consistent with the exposures associated with the nature and 

scope of our operations. Our policies are generally based on our safety record as well as market trends in the insurance industry and are subject to certain deductibles, limits and policy terms and conditions. 

Effective for model year 2016, we began providing a limited warranty for a period up to five &#32;years for both Malibu and Axis brand boats. For model years prior to 2016, we provided a limited warranty for a period of up to three years &#32;for our Malibu brand boats and two years &#32;for our Axis boats. During the warranty period, we reimburse dealers and Malibu Boats authorized service facilities for all or a portion of the cost of repair or replacement performed on the products (mainly composed of parts or accessories provided by us and labor costs incurred by dealers or Malibu Boats authorized service facilities). Some materials, components or parts of the boat that are not covered by our limited product warranties are separately warranted by their manufacturers or suppliers. These other warranties include warranties covering engines and other components. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright protection, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our rights in our brand, products and proprietary technology. This is an important part of our business and we intend to continue protecting our intellectual property. We currently hold 18 U.S. patents, one Australian patent, one Canadian patent, seven pending U.S. patent applications and three pending Australian patent applications. 

We own 32 registered trademarks in various countries around the world. Such trademarks may endure in perpetuity on a country-by-country basis, provided that we comply with all statutory maintenance requirements, including continued use of each trademark in each such country. We currently do not own any registered copyrights. 

Competition 

The powerboat industry, including the performance sport boat category, is highly competitive for consumers and dealers. Competition affects our ability to succeed in the markets we currently serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We compete with large manufacturers who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also compete with a wide variety of small, independent manufacturers. Competition in our industry is based primarily on brand name, price and product performance. For more information, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits.&#8221; 

Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters 

Our operations and products are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation under various federal, commonwealth, state, and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations in the United States and Australia where we manufacture our boats, and in other foreign jurisdictions where we sell our products. We believe we are in material compliance with those requirements. However, we cannot be certain that costs and expenses required for us to comply with such requirements in the future, including for any new or modified regulatory requirements, or to address newly discovered environmental conditions, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow. The regulatory programs to which we are subject include the following: 

Hazardous Materials and Waste 

Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified as hazardous materials by the national, state and local governments in those jurisdictions where we manufacture our products. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in the United States by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;USEPA&#8221;), and state and local environmental agencies. The handling, storage, release, treatment and recycling or disposal of these substances and wastes from our operations are regulated in Australia by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, the New South Wales EPA and other state and local authorities. Failure by us to properly handle, store, release, treat, recycle or dispose of our hazardous materials and wastes could result in liability for us, including fines, penalties, or obligations to investigate and remediate any contamination originating from our operations or facilities. We are not aware of any contamination at our current or former facilities for which we could be liable under environmental laws or regulations, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any contamination. Future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliance could, however, could give rise to investigation and remediation obligations or related liabilities. 

Air Quality 

In the United States, the federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and corresponding state and local laws and rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. Because our manufacturing operations involve molding and coating of fiberglass materials, which involves the emission of certain volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter, we are required to maintain and comply with a CAA operating permit (Title V permit) for our Tennessee and local air permits for our California facilities. Our air permits require us to monitor our emissions and periodically certify that our emissions are within specified limits. To date, we have not had material difficulty complying with those limits. 

The USEPA and the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) have adopted regulations stipulating that many marine propulsion engines and watercraft meet certain air emission standards. Some of those standards requires fitting a catalytic converter to the engine. These regulations also require, among other things, that engine manufacturers provide a warranty that their engines meet USEPA and CARB emission standards. The engines used in our products are subject to these regulations. CARB also recently adopted an evaporative emissions regulation that applies to all MY 2018 spark-ignition marine watercraft with permanently installed fuel tanks sold in California. The new regulation requires subject boat manufacturers to use specific CARB-certified components for the fuel systems in their boats, or to certify the boat meets a related performance standard. The USEPA and CARB emissions regulations have increased the cost to manufacture our products. 

OSHA 

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Our facilities are regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. Although capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws are expected to increase, we do not currently anticipate any material expenditure will be required to continue to comply with existing OSHA environmental or safety regulations in connection with our existing manufacturing facilities. 

At our New South Wales, Australia (&#8220;NSW&#8221;) facility, employee health and safety is regulated by SafeWork NSW, which also has requirements that limit the amount of certain emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. In addition, SafeWork NSW provides licensing and registration for potentially dangerous work, investigates workplace incidents, and enforces work health and safety laws in NSW. Our NSW facilities are regularly inspected by SafeWork NSW. We believe that our facilities comply in all material aspects with these requirements. 

Boat Design and Manufacturing Standards 

Powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community&#8217;s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats in the United States is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. We have instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of our third-party suppliers. None of the recalls has had a material adverse effect on our Company. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 , we employed 540 &#32;people, 426 &#32;of whom work at our facilities in Tennessee, 44 &#32;of whom work at our California site, 65 &#32;of whom work at our Australia facility and five &#32;who work remotely. As of June 30, 2016 , approximately 18.3% &#32;of our employees were salaried and 81.7% &#32;were hourly workers. As of June 30, 2015, we had 509 employees. We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees, treating them as business partners and focusing on building careers. As of June 30, 2016 , more than 14.8% &#32;of our employees had been with us for ten or more years. 

None of our employees are represented by a labor union and, since our founding in 1982, we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. Since 2012, we have engaged an outside consultant to assist with employee training, in order to provide our employees a path for upward mobility and develop leadership skills applicable to their day-to-day responsibilities. 

Organizational Structure 

Malibu Boats, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 1, 2013 in anticipation of the IPO to serve as a holding company that owns only an interest in Malibu Boats Holdings, LLC. Immediately after the completion of the Recapitalization (as defined below) and IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. held approximately 49.3% of the economic interest in the LLC, 

which has since increased to approximately 92.6% of the economic interest in the LLC as of June 30, 2016 . See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion of our Recapitalization (as defined therein), IPO, and subsequent equity transactions. 

The certificate of incorporation of Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Holders of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock have voting power over Malibu Boats, Inc., the sole managing member of the LLC, at a level that is consistent with their overall equity ownership of our business. In connection with the Recapitalization and IPO, Malibu Boats, Inc. issued to each pre-IPO owner, for nominal consideration, one share of Class B Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc., each of which provides its owner with no economic rights but entitles the holder to one vote on matters presented to stockholders of Malibu Boats, Inc. for each LLC Unit held by such holder. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each share of Class A Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to vote. Each holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the total number of LLC units held by such holder multiplied by the exchange rate specified in the exchange agreement with respect to each matter presented to our stockholders on which the holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote. Accordingly, the holders of LLC Units collectively have a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units that they hold. As the LLC members sell LLC Units to us or subsequently exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock of Malibu Boats, Inc. pursuant to the exchange agreement described below, the voting power afforded to them by their shares of Class B Common Stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced. Subject to any rights that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, our Class A and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise provided in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or required by applicable law. In addition, subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to share equally, identically and ratably in any dividends or distributions (including in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs) that our board of directors may determine to issue from time to time, while holders of our Class B Common Stock do not have any right to receive dividends or other distributions. 

As noted above, Malibu Boats, Inc. is a holding company with a controlling equity interest in the LLC. Malibu Boats, Inc., as sole managing member of the LLC, operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of the LLC. The limited liability company agreement of the LLC provides that it may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified by the written consent of Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, in its sole discretion without the approval of any other holder of LLC Units, except that no amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of a holder of LLC Units, other than on a pro rata basis with other holders of LLC Units, without the consent of such holder (unless more than one holder is so affected, then the consent of a majority of such affected holders is required). Pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc. has the right to determine when distributions (other than tax distributions) will be made to the members of the LLC and the amount of any such distributions. If Malibu Boats, Inc. authorizes a distribution, such distribution will be made to the members of the LLC (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective LLC Units. 

The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure, as of June 30, 2016 : 

Our organizational structure allows the LLC members to retain their equity ownership in the LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of LLC Units. Holders of Class A Common Stock, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in Malibu Boats, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A Common Stock. We believe that the LLC members generally will find it advantageous to hold their equity interests in an entity that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The holders of LLC Units, including Malibu Boats, Inc., will incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any taxable income of the LLC. Net profits and net losses of the LLC will generally be allocated to the LLC&#8217;s members (including Malibu Boats, Inc.) pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective limited liability company interests. The limited liability company agreement provides for cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that the taxable income of the LLC will give rise to taxable income for its members. In accordance with the limited liability company agreement, we intend to cause the LLC to make cash distributions to the holders of LLC Units for purposes of funding their tax obligations in respect of the income of the LLC that is allocated to them. Generally, these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the taxable income of the LLC allocable to such holder of LLC Units multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in Los Angeles, California (taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income). For purposes of determining the taxable income of the LLC, such determination will be made by generally disregarding any adjustment to the taxable income of any member of the LLC that arises under the tax basis adjustment rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code and is attributable to the acquisition by such member of an interest in the LLC in a sale or exchange transaction. 

Exchanges and Other Transactions with Holders of LLC Units 

In connection with the Recapitalization and IPO, we entered into an exchange agreement with the pre-IPO owners of the LLC under which (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) each pre-IPO owner (or its permitted transferee) has the 

right to exchange its LLC Units for shares of our Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications, or, at our option, except in the event of a change in control, for a cash payment equal to the market value of the Class A Common Stock. The exchange agreement provides, however, that such exchanges must be for a minimum of the lesser of 1,000 LLC Units, all of the LLC Units held by the holder, or such amount as we determine to be acceptable. The exchange agreement also provides that an LLC member will not have the right to exchange LLC Units if Malibu Boats, Inc. determines that such exchange would be prohibited by law or regulation or would violate other agreements with Malibu Boats, Inc. to which the LLC member may be subject or any of our written policies related to unlawful or insider trading. The exchange agreement also provides that Malibu Boats, Inc. may impose additional restrictions on exchanges that it determines to be necessary or advisable so that the LLC is not treated as a &#8220;publicly traded partnership&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, pursuant to the limited liability company agreement of the LLC, Malibu Boats, Inc., as managing member of the LLC, has the right to require all members of the LLC to exchange their LLC Units for Class A Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the exchange agreement, subject to the consent of the holders of a majority of outstanding LLC Units other than those held by Malibu Boats, Inc. 

As a result of exchanges of LLC Units into Class A Common Stock and purchases by Malibu Boats, Inc. of LLC Units from holders of LLC Units, like we completed in our IPO and follow-on offerings, Malibu Boats, Inc. will become entitled to a proportionate share of the existing tax basis of the assets of the LLC at the time of such exchanges or purchases. In addition, such exchanges and purchases of LLC Units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of the LLC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Malibu Boats, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) that provides for the payment by Malibu Boats, Inc. to the pre-IPO owners (or their permitted assignees) of 85% of the amount of the benefits, if any, that Malibu Boats, Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of (1) increases in tax basis and (2) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. These payment obligations are obligations of Malibu Boats, Inc. and not of the LLC.
