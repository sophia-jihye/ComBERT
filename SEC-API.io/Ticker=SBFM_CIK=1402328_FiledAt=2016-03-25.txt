 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

History 

We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name &#8220;Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.&#8221; Until October 2009, our business was to provide management consulting with regard to accounting, computer and general business issues for small and home-office based companies. 

Effective October 15, 2009, we executed an agreement to acquire Sunshine Biopharma, Inc., a Colorado corporation, in exchange for the issuance of 21,962,000 shares of our Common Stock and 850,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into twenty (20) shares of our Common Stock. As a result of this transaction we changed our name to &#8220;Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. The majority of the Common Shares and all of the Convertible Preferred Shares we issued for this transaction were issued to Advanomics Corporation, a privately held Canadian company (&#8220;Advanomics&#8221;). On December 21, 2011, Advanomics exercised its right to convert the 850,000 shares of Series &#8220;A&#8221; Preferred Stock it held in our Company into 17,000,000 shares of Common Stock. 

Description of Current Business 

We are currently a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer. The preclinical studies for our lead compound, Adva-27a, a multi-purpose antitumor compound, were successfully completed in late 2011 with additional preclinical work and manufacturing process development performed through 2015. We are now continuing our clinical development of Adva-27a by conducting the next sequence of steps comprised of Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) manufacturing of a 2 kilogram quantity of our drug, Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;)-enabling studies, regulatory filing and Phase I clinical trials. We plan to conduct our Phase I clinical trials for Adva-27a at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada, one of McGill University&#8217;s Hospital Centers. The planned indication will be pancreatic cancer in parallel to multidrug resistant breast cancer, as Adva-27a has shown a positive effect on both of these cancer types for which there is currently little or no treatment options available. See &#8220;Clinical Trials&#8221; below. 

Acquisition of Patents 

On October 8, 2015, we executed a Patent Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;October Purchase Agreement&#8221;), with Advanomics, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935 (the &#8220;US Patent&#8221;) for our Adva-27a anticancer compound. The October Purchase Agreement provided us with direct ownership of the US Patent, which includes all rights to this intellectual property within the United States. Prior, we had been licensing the right to use the US Patent from Advanomics pursuant to the terms of an Exclusive License Agreement, as amended (the &#8220;Exclusive License Agreement&#8221;). In consideration for the assignment of the US Patent, we agreed to make payments of twelve (12) consecutive annual payments of $360,000 starting in 2016. Advanomics was granted a security interest in the US Patent until all payments due under the October Purchase Agreements were made. The October Purchase Agreement terminated the Exclusive License Agreement and all obligations thereunder. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Effective December 28, 2015, we executed an amendment to the October Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, the note of the October Purchase Agreement was cancelled and replaced with a new note having a face value of $210,519, comprised of $155,940 in principal amount which is Advanomics&#8217; book value of the US Patent, plus $54,579 as an adjustment for the currency exchange difference. The new note is interest-free and automatically convertible into 80,968,965 shares of our Common Stock once we increase our authorized capital so that we have sufficient shares of our Common Stock authorized for issuance. Advanomics has retained a security interest in the US Patent until such time as the automatic conversion of the new note into Common Shares is completed. 

On December 28, 2015, we executed a second Patent Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;December Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Advanomics pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to all of the remaining worldwide rights in and to patents issued and pending under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 (the &#8220;Worldwide Patents&#8221;) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a. The purchase price paid by us for the Worldwide Patents was $12,822,499, which was payable pursuant to the terms of a secured promissory note, with quarterly payments of $70,000 in principal and interest beginning in March 2016 and continuing each consecutive calendar quarter thereafter through December 2020. 

Subsequently, we agreed to amend the December Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, the note of the December Purchase Agreement was cancelled and replaced with a new note having a face value of $624,875, comprised of $462,870 in principal amount, which is the Advanomics book value of the Worldwide Patents, plus $162,005 as an adjustment for the currency exchange difference. The new note is interest-free and automatically convertible into 240,336,451 shares of our Common Stock upon our completing an increase in our authorized capital so that we have sufficient shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance. The effective date of this amendment was December 28, 2015. 

As a result of the aforesaid two transactions we now own all of the patents and rights throughout the world for Adva-27a. The US Patent and the Worldwide Patents described above are herein jointly referred to as the &#8220;Patents.&#8221; 

The aggregate consideration specified in the two original Patent Purchase Agreements created debt obligations to us of $17,142,499, including annual and quarterly payments totaling $640,000. It was believed that purchase of the Patents would facilitate our ability to obtain the funding necessary to complete the development and Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) approval process for Adva-27a. However, it became apparent that the burdensome financial obligations imposed by the terms of the original Patent Purchase Agreements were not conducive to our obtaining such financing, to the mutual detriment of both ourselves and Advanomics. Accordingly, we executed the aforesaid amendments to the original Patent Purchase Agreements which provided for (i) reduction of the purchase price of the Patents from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the Advanomics book value of the Patents, (ii) elimination of all cash payments obligations, and (iii) automatic convertibility of the new promissory notes for the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of Common Stock upon our increasing our authorized capital such that this number of Common Shares can be issued. 

Prior to the aforesaid patent purchase transactions, we were licensing our Adva-27a technology on an exclusive basis from Advanomics (&#8220;Exclusive License Agreement&#8221;). On December 21, 2011, we executed an amendment to the Exclusive License Agreement which waived a condition of termination and revised the consideration payable to Advanomics. The original Exclusive License Agreement required us to exercise an option to purchase shares in Advanomics for aggregate consideration of $9,700,000 ($5.00 per share). This obligation was waived and replaced with an annual licensing fee of $360,000.00 and reimbursement of research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) expenses incurred by Advanomics in connection with Adva-27a, the Licensed Material as defined in the Exclusive License Agreement. See &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.&#8221; 

We believe the financial terms of the two aforesaid Patent Purchase Agreements and Amendments thereof are more favorable to us than under the Exclusive License Agreement. Our obligations under the Exclusive License Agreement required us to pay Advanomics a perpetual annual license fee of $360,000 and reimburse Advanomics for all R&#38;D expenses incurred by Advanomics in connection with Adva-27a, the Licensed Material (as defined in the Exclusive License Agreement). The Patent Purchase Agreements terminated the Exclusive License Agreement and all obligations thereunder and provided for purchase of the Patents as described above. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Certain members of our management, including Dr. Steve N. Slilaty, our President, CEO and a Director and Camille Sebaaly, our Secretary, CFO and a Director, hold similar positions with Advanomics. We believe that the terms of the patent acquisitions are fair and reasonable and will result in a greater opportunity for us to obtain the funding necessary to complete the development and approval process of the FDA for Adva-27a. However, there are no assurances this will occur and as of the date of this report, we have no binding commitment from any financing source to provide us with the funds necessary to complete the approval process. 

In addition to purchasing the Patents, we are planning to initiate our own R&#38;D program as soon as practicable once financing is in place. There are no assurances that we will obtain the financing necessary to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan, or to enter clinical trials. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources," below. 

&#160; 

Our Lead Compound (Adva-27a) 

Our initial drug candidate is Adva-27a, a GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of Podophyllotoxin, targeted for various forms of cancer. If we are successful in our current financing efforts, Adva-27a is expected to enter Phase I clinical trials for pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer in late 2016 or early 2017 (see &#8220;Clinical Development Path&#8221; and &#8220;Clinical Trials&#8221; below). Etoposide, which is also a derivative of Podophyllotoxin, is currently on the market and is used to treat various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, testicular cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and several other forms of cancer. Like Etoposide, Adva-27a is a Topoisomerase II inhibitor; however, unlike Etoposide and other anti-tumor drugs currently in use, Adva-27a is able to destroy multidrug resistant cancer cells. Adva-27a is a new chemical entity and has been shown to have distinct and more desirable biological properties compared to Etoposide. Most notably, Adva-27a is very effective against multidrug resistant breast cancer cells while Etoposide has no activity against this aggressive form of cancer (see Figure 1). In other side-by-side studies against Etoposide as a reference, Adva-27a showed markedly improved cell killing activity in various other cancer types, particularly prostate, colon and lung cancer (see Table 1). Our preclinical studies to date have shown that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a is effective at killing different types of multidrug resistant cancer cells, including: 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#176; 

Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7/MDR) 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#176; 

Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H69AR) 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#176; 

Uterine Cancer (MES-SA/Dx5) 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#176; 

Pancreatic Cancer (Panc-1) 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies and pharmacokinetics data in rats. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase II with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar (this number has recently been reduce to 1.44 micromolar as a result of resolving the two isomeric forms of Adva-27a). 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Adva-27a does not inhibit tubulin assembly. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

These and other preclinical data have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, a peer-reviewed International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment. The manuscript entitled &#8220;Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells&#8221; appeared in print in the October 2012 issue of the journal [ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32 : 4423-4432 (2012)]. A copy of the full manuscript as it appeared in the journal is available on our website at www.sunshinebiopharma.com .

Clinical Development Path 

The early stage preclinical studies for our lead compound, Adva-27a, were successfully completed and the results have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32 : 4423-4432 (2012). We have been delayed in our implementation of our clinical development program due to lack of funding. Our fund raising efforts are continuing and as soon as adequate financing is in place we will continue our clinical development program of Adva-27a by conducting the next sequence of steps comprised of the following. There are no assurances we will be successful in our fund raising efforts:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

GMP Manufacturing 

On November 14, 2014, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza Ltd. and Lonza Sales Ltd. (hereinafter jointly referred to as &#8220;Lonza&#8221;), whereby we engaged Lonza to be the manufacturer of our Adva-27a anticancer drug (the &#8220;Lonza Agreement&#8221;). Lonza is one of the world&#8217;s leading and most-trusted manufacturers of pharmaceutical ingredients. Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Lonza has more than 40 major manufacturing facilities worldwide and is currently manufacturing 2 kilograms of our Adva-27a for clinical trials. The Lonza Agreement was effective November 10, 2014, has a term of 5 years, and may be extended or terminated earlier as provided in the Lonza Agreement. 

&#160; 

In June 2015 we received a sample of the scale-up manufacturing process for evaluation and confirmation of adherence to specifications. Based upon our laboratory analyses, the sample meets all of the required chemical, physical and biological specifications. This paves the way for moving forward with large scale manufacturing of a 2-kilogram quantity for the IND-Enabling studies and clinical trials. If the timetable for generating the 2-kilogram quantity is met, of which there can be no assurance, and subject to receipt of the necessary financing, also for which no assurances can be provided, we expect to move into Phase I of our clinical trials in late 2016 or early 2017. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Lonza Agreement, Lonza will manufacture our drug in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) in compliance with the regulations applicable in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other countries around the world relating to the manufacturing of medicinal products for human use. Lonza will build a master drug file for our Adva-27a drug and will have it ready for filing with regulatory authorities as may be required to secure ultimate drug approval. The Lonza Agreement provides for us to maintain one representative of our Company at their facility during the manufacturing process. Quality assurance and control is the responsibility of both Lonza and us during the process. 

We have the right to inspect, test and approve all batches to insure compliance with the manufacturing specifications, which is required to be completed within 30 days after release of a batch. In the event of a dispute regarding compliance with the manufacturing specifications, the dispute will be resolved ultimately by independent analysis and testing. The Lonza Agreement contains customary warranties and disclaimers, confidentiality provisions as well as mutual indemnifications common in agreements of this type. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

Adva-27a&#8217;s initial indication will be pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer for which there are currently little or no treatment options available. In June 2011 we concluded an agreement with McGill University&#8217;s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada to conduct Phase I clinical trials for these two indications. All aspects of the planned clinical trials in Canada will employ FDA standards at all levels. As a result of the Dutchess Agreement and other financing opportunities described below, we now anticipate that Phase I clinical trials will commence in late 2016 or early 2017 and we estimate that it will take 18 months to complete, at which time we expect to receive limited marketing approval for &#8220;compassionate-use&#8221; under the FDA and similar guidelines in Canada. See &#160;&#8220;Marketing,&#8221; below. 

Marketing 

According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Given the terminal and limited treatment options available for the pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer indications we are planning to study, we anticipate being granted limited marketing approval (&#8220;compassionate-use&#8221;) for our Adva-27a following receipt of funding and a successful Phase I clinical trial. There are no assurances that either will occur. Such limited approval will allow us to make the drug available to various hospitals and health care centers for experimental therapy and/or &#8220;compassionate-use&#8221;, thereby generating some revenues in the near-term. 

&#160; 

We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to buyout or license our drug. However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us. In the event we do not consummate such a transaction, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drug. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

Effective October 8, 2015, we executed a Patent Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;October Purchase Agreement&#8221;), with Advanomics, a related party, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935 (the &#8220;US Patent&#8221;) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a. On December 28, 2015, we executed a second Patent Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;December Purchase Agreement&#8221;), with Advanomics, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to all of the remaining worldwide rights covered by issued and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 (the &#8220;Worldwide Patents&#8221;) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a. See &#8220;Business &#8211; Acquisition of Patents&#8221; above. 

&#160; 

Effective December 28, 2015, we entered into amendments (the &#8220;Amendments&#8221;) of these Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the total purchase price was reduced from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the book value of this intellectual property on the financial statements of Advanomics. Further, the Amendments provided for automatic conversion of the promissory notes representing the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of our Common Stock once we increase our authorized capital such that these shares can be issued. The October and December Purchase Agreements and Amendments thereof provide us with direct ownership of all worldwide patents and rights pertaining to Adva-27a. 

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulations 

Our existing and proposed business operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. We will be subject to significant regulations in the U.S. in order to obtain the approval of the FDA to offer our product on the market. The approximate procedure for obtaining FDA approval involves an initial filing of an IND application following which the FDA would give the go ahead with Phase I clinical (human) trials. Following completion of Phase I, the results are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase II. Similarly, following completion of Phase II the data are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase III. Following completion of Phase III, a request is made for marketing approval. Depending on various issues and considerations, the FDA could provide limited marketing approval on a humanitarian basis if the drug treats terminally ill patients with limited treatment options available. As of the date of this Report we have not made any filings with the FDA or other regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. We have however had extensive discussions with clinicians at the McGill University&#8217;s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal where we plan to undertake our Phase I study for pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer they believe that Health Canada is likely to grant us a so-called fast-track process on the basis of the terminal nature of the cancer types which we will be treating. There are no assurances this will occur. 

Employees 

As of the date of this Report we have three (3) employees, our management. We anticipate that if we receive financing we will hire additional employees in the areas of accounting, regulatory affairs, marketing and laboratory personnel. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

We will be competing with publicly and privately held companies engaged in developing cancer therapies. There are numerous other entities engaged in this business that have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us. Nearly all major pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Roche, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, to name just a few, have on-going anti-cancer drug development programs and some of the drug they may develop could be in direct competition with our drug. Also, a number of small companies are also working in the area of cancer and could develop drugs that may be in competition with ours. However, none of these competitor companies can use molecules similar to ours as they would be infringing our patents. 

Trademarks-Tradenames 

We are the exclusive owner of all worldwide rights pertaining to Adva-27a covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029. The patent applications filed under PCT/FR2007/000697 have been issued in Europe, Canada, the United States (8,236,935) and elsewhere around the world. The patent applications recently filed internationally under PCT/CA2014/000029 are still pending. 

Development of a new Business 

On July 25, 2014, we formed Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc., a Canadian wholly owned subsidiary for the purposes of conducting pharmaceutical business in Canada and elsewhere around the globe. While no assurances can be provided and subject to the availability of adequate financing, of which there is no assurance, we anticipate that Sunshine Biopharma Canada will soon secure a Drug Establishment License (DEL) from Health Canada and proceed to signing manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution contracts for various generic pharmaceutical products. This new effort broadens our business scope and provides us with the opportunity to generate revenues in the near to mid-term. We anticipate revenues to be generated through the export of generic pharmaceuticals overseas. There are no assurances that we will be able to sign applicable contracts or generate profits from these anticipated new operations. In addition to revenue generation, we anticipate that as a result of these activities, Sunshine Biopharma Canada will then be well positioned for the marketing and distribution of Adva-27a, our flagship oncology drug candidate currently being developed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer, provided that Adva-27a is approved for such marketing and distribution, of which there can be no assurance. 

&#160; 

While no assurances can be provided, we are also planning to expand our product line through acquisitions and/or in-licensing as well as in-house R&#38;D.
