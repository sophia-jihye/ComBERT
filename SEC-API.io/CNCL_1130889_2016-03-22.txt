 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Historical Development 

&#160; 

Cancer Capital Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 11, 1997, to develop an alternative medical waste treatment and processing equipment system. We were unsuccessful in that endeavor and abandoned that business plan in December 1997. Since that time we have had limited operations.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

&#160;

&#8226; A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; &#160;

&#8226; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; &#160;

&#8226; Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company&#8217;s executive compensation arrangements; and &#160;

&#8226; No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. &#160;

We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this report, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;).

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company accounting standard effective dates.

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

&#160;

For more details regarding this exemption, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies,&#8221; below.

&#160;

Our Business Plan 

&#160; 

Our business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire an interest in a business opportunity. Our acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise. We have very limited sources of capital, and we probably will only be able to take advantage of one business opportunity. As of the date of this filing we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any preliminary or definitive agreements or understandings with any person concerning an acquisition or merger.

&#160; 

The current economy creates more challenges for the success of our business plan. With the general lack of investor confidence and the uncertainty related to the future global economy, management believes that equity investments and transactions may be less attractive then they have been in the past. However, management believes that it is possible, if not probable, for a company like ours, without many assets or liabilities, to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable private company. The opportunity arises principally because of the expensive legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration process of &#8220;going public.&#8221; But if the global economy fails to grow, then it is very possible that there would be little or no economic value for another company to enter into a transaction with Cancer Capital.

&#160;

Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry and includes both U.S. and international companies. Our management has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors. Our management believes companies who desire a public market to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, or plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, will be potential merger or acquisition candidates.

&#160;

The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and extremely risky and will be made by management in the exercise of their business judgment. Our activities are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no operating business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which will, in all probability, act without consent, vote, or approval of our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and merge with or acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to Cancer Capital and our stockholders. Should a merger or acquisition prove unsuccessful, it is possible management may decide not to pursue further acquisition activities and management may abandon our search and we may become dormant or be dissolved.

&#160;

It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by us could be limited by the fact that while our common stock is cleared for a quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, there is currently no public trading of our common stock on any market. We cannot assure you that a market will develop or that a stockholder will be able to liquidate his/her/its investments without considerable delay, if at all. If a market develops, our shares will likely be subject to the rules of the Penny Stock Suitability Reform Act of 1990. The liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure procedures required by those rules to be followed by all broker-dealers, including but not limited to, determining the suitability of the stock for a particular customer, and obtaining a written agreement from the customer to purchase the stock. This rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in any market.

&#160;

&#160;

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities 

&#160;

We anticipate that business opportunities will come to our attention from various sources, including our officers and directors, our stockholders, professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, investment banking firms, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. Management expects that prior personal and business relationships may lead to contacts with these various sources.

&#160;

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business&#8217;s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to our management. This due diligence review may be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. We anticipate that we will rely upon funds provided by advances and/or loans from management and significant stockholders to conduct investigation and analysis of any potential target companies or businesses. We may also rely upon the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other persons associated with the target business seeking our participation.

&#160;

Our management will analyze the business opportunities; however, none of our management are professional business analysts. (See Part III, Item 10, below.) Our management has had limited experience with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been involved with an initial public offering. Due to management&#8217;s limited experience with mergers and acquisitions, they may rely on principal stockholders or associates, or promoters or their affiliates to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities.

&#160;

Certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between us and our officers and directors. Our management has other business interests to which they currently devote attention, which include their primary employment. Also, our President, Mr. Peters, holds management positions with other reporting companies which are also seeking business opportunities. (See Part III, Item 10, below.) Our management may be expected to continue to devote their attention to these other business interests although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through their exercise of judgment in a manner which is consistent with their fiduciary duties to us.

&#160;

A decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made upon our management&#8217;s analysis of:

&#160;

&#8226; the quality of the business opportunity&#8217;s management and personnel, &#8226; the anticipated acceptability of its new products or marketing concept, &#8226; the merit of its technological changes, &#8226; the perceived benefit that it will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and &#8226; numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. &#160;

No one factor described above will be controlling in the selection of a business opportunity. Management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potential business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development. Thus, the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities will be extremely difficult and complex. Potential investors must recognize that because of our limited capital available for investigation and management&#8217;s limited experience in business analysis, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business opportunity to be acquired.

&#160;

In many instances, we anticipate that the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future operations because of the possible need to substantially shift marketing approaches, significantly expand operations, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. We will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement, or be primarily responsible for, the implementation of required changes.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

Form of Acquisition 

&#160;

We cannot predict the manner in which we may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as our needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity. The legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected based upon our review and our relative negotiating strength. Such methods may include, but are not limited to, leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. We may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other forms of organization. We may be required to merge, consolidate or reorganize with other corporations or forms of business organizations. In addition, our present management and stockholders most likely will not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed to fill those vacancies without any vote by our stockholders.

&#160;

We likely will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called &#34;tax free&#34; reorganization under Section 368(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#34;Code&#34;) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other &#34;tax free&#34; provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in that circumstance retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those persons who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.

&#160;

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. Also, fees may be paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers. These fees are usually used to pay legal costs, accounting costs, finder&#8217;s fees, consultant&#8217;s fees and other related expenses. In the event that any such fees are paid, they may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us. We have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees.

&#160;

Significant stockholders may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out transaction. We have not adopted any procedures or policies for the review, approval or ratification of any related party transactions.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.

&#160;

In the event we merge or acquire a business opportunity, the successor company will be subject to our reporting obligations. This is commonly referred to as a &#8220;back door registration.&#8221; A back door registration occurs when a non-reporting company becomes the successor of a reporting company by merger, consolidation, exchange of securities, acquisition of assets or otherwise. This type of event requires the successor company to file a current report with the SEC which provides the same kind of information about the company to be acquired that would appear in a registration statement, including audited and pro forma financial statements. This regulation may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of transactions. Accordingly, we may incur additional expense to conduct due diligence and present the required information for the business opportunity in any report.

&#160;

Also, the SEC may elect to conduct a full review of the successor company and may issue substantive comments on the sufficiency of disclosure related to the company to be acquired.

&#160;

In addition, regulations also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities of a shell company, and limit the use of Form S-8 to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for the Company to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such an instance, there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expense costs that are normally avoided by &#8220;back door&#8221; registrations.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We expect to encounter substantial competition in our effort to locate attractive business opportunities. Business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals will be our primary competition. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than we do and will be in a better position than we are to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. We also will experience competition from other public reporting companies, many of which may have more funds available for such transactions.

&#160;

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business 

&#160;

We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors, of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members&#8217; appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies&#8217; auditors; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.

&#160;

We are subject to the Exchange Act of 1934 and are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. We are also subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act which requires the Company to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting of stockholders or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

If we acquire a &#8220;non-reporting issuer&#8221; under the Exchange Act, we will be subject to the &#8220;back-door registration&#8221; requirements of the SEC that will require us to file a Current Report on Form 8-K that will include all information about such &#8220;non-reporting issuer&#8221; as would have been required to be filed by that entity had it filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC.

&#160;

Research and Development and Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we have not spent any funds on research and development. Nor have we recognized any costs related to compliance with environmental laws.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have no employees. Our management expects to confer with consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating business opportunities. We will determine the need for employees based upon a specific business opportunity, if any.
