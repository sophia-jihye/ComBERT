 

1. Description of Business 

YRC Worldwide, one of the largest transportation service providers in the world, is a holding company that through wholly owned operating subsidiaries and its interest in a Chinese joint venture offers its customers a wide range of transportation services. YRC Worldwide has one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities. Through our team of experienced service professionals, we offer expertise in LTL shipments and flexible supply chain solutions, ensuring customers can ship industrial, commercial and retail goods with confidence. Our reporting segments include the following: 

&#8226; 

YRC Freight is the reporting segment that focuses on longer haul business opportunities with national, regional and international services. YRC Freight provides for the movement of industrial, commercial and retail goods, primarily through centralized management. This reporting segment includes our LTL subsidiary YRC Freight and YRC Reimer, a subsidiary located in Canada that specializes in shipments into, across and out of Canada. In addition to the United States and Canada, YRC Freight also serves parts of Mexico, Puerto Rico and Guam. 

&#8226; 

Regional Transportation is the reporting segment for our transportation service providers focused on business opportunities in the regional and next-day delivery markets. Regional Transportation is comprised of Holland, New Penn and Reddaway. These companies each provide regional, next-day ground services in their respective regions through a network of facilities located across the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. 

2. Accounting Policies 

Accounting policies refer to specific accounting principles and the methods of applying those principles to fairly present our financial position and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The policies discussed below include those that management has determined to be the most appropriate in preparing our financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of YRC Worldwide and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We report on a calendar year basis. The quarters of the Regional Transportation companies (with the exception of New Penn) consist of thirteen weeks that end on a Saturday either before or after the end of March, June and September, whereas all other operating segment quarters end on the natural calendar quarter end. Our investment in the non-majority owned affiliate in which we do not have control, where the entity is either not a variable interest entity, or YRC Worldwide is not the primary beneficiary, is accounted for on the equity method. 

Use of Estimates 

Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed assets and revenue-related reserves; the valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities and non-union pension plan liability and fair value of plan assets; and workers&#8217; compensation and property damage and liability claims, and income tax uncertainties. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less. Under the Company&#8217;s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes which are classified within accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The change in book overdrafts are reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. 

Concentration of Credit Risks and Other 

We sell services and extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer&#8217;s financial condition, without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer&#8217;s financial condition. We monitor our exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses. 

At December 31, 2015 , approximately 78% &#32;of our labor force is subject to collective bargaining agreements. As part of the 2014 Financing Transactions (which is described more fully in the &#8220;Debt and Financing&#8221; footnote to our consolidated financial statements), the primary labor agreement was modified to, among other things, extend the expiration date of our previous agreement from March 31, 2015 to March 31, 2019. This extension also extended the contribution rates under our multi-employer pension plan. The modification provided for lump sum payments in lieu of wage increases in 2014 and 2015, but provided for wage increases in 2016 through 2019. We amortized these lump sum payments over the period in which the wages were not increased beginning on April 1, 2014. Finally, the modification provided for certain changes to work rules and our use of purchased transportation in certain situations. 

Revenue Recognition and Revenue-related Reserves 

For shipments in transit, we record revenue based on the percentage of service completed as of the period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred. The percentage of service completed for each shipment is based on how far along in the shipment cycle each shipment is in relation to standard transit days. Standard transit days are defined as our published service days between origin zip code and destination zip code. Based on historical cost and engineering studies, certain percentages of revenue are determined to be earned during each stage of the shipment cycle, such as initial pick up, long distance transportation, intermediate transfer and customer delivery. Using standard transit times, we analyze each shipment in transit at a particular period end to determine what stage the shipment is in. We apply that stage&#8217;s percentage of revenue earned factor to the rated revenue for that shipment to determine the revenue dollars earned by that shipment in the current period. The total revenue earned is accumulated for all shipments in transit at a particular period end and recorded as operating revenue. 

&#160; 

In addition, we recognize revenue on a gross basis because we are the primary obligors even when we use other transportation service providers who act on our behalf. We remain responsible to our customers for complete and proper shipment, including the risk of physical loss or damage of the goods and cargo claims issues. We assign pricing to bills of lading at the time of shipment based primarily on the weight, general classification of the product, the shipping destination and individual customer discounts. This process is referred to as rating. At various points throughout our process, incorrect ratings could be identified based on many factors, including weight verifications or updated customer discounts. Although the majority of rerating occurs in the same month as the original rating, a portion occurs during the following periods. We accrue a reserve for rerating based primarily on historical trends. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , our financial statements included a rerate reserve as a reduction to &#8220;Accounts Receivable&#8221; of $8.1 &#32;million and $12.2 &#32;million, respectively. 

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on historical uncollectible amounts. We also take into account known factors surrounding specific customers and overall collection trends. Our process involves performing ongoing credit evaluations of customers, including the market in which they operate and the overall economic conditions. We continually review historical trends and customer specific factors and make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate. Our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $7.4 million &#32;and $10.0 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Foreign Currency 

Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, whereas, our foreign operations utilize the local currency as their functional currency. Accordingly, for purposes of translating foreign subsidiary financial statements to the U.S. dollar reporting currency, assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rates and income and expenses are translated monthly, at the average exchange rates for each respective month, with changes recognized in other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions resulted in net gains of $9.3 &#32;million, $5.7 &#32;million and $3.7 &#32;million during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, and are included in &#8220;Other nonoperating (income) expense&#8221; in the accompanying statements of consolidated operations. 

Claims and Insurance Accruals 

Claims and insurance accruals, both current and long-term, reflect the estimated settlement cost of claims for workers&#8217; compensation, property damage and liability claims, and cargo loss and damage that insurance does not cover. We establish and modify reserve estimates for workers&#8217; compensation and property damage and liability claims primarily upon actuarial analyses prepared by independent actuaries. These reserves are discounted to present value using a risk-free rate based on the year of occurrence. The risk-free rate is the U.S. Treasury rate for maturities that match the expected payout of such claims and was 1.0% , 0.9% &#32;and 0.5% &#32;for workers&#8217; compensation claims incurred as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The rate was 0.7% , 0.4% &#32;and 0.3% &#32;for property damage and liability claims incurred as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The process of determining reserve requirements utilizes historical trends and involves an evaluation of accident frequency and severity, claims management, changes in health care costs and certain future administrative costs. The effect of future inflation for costs is considered in the actuarial analysis. Adjustments to previously established reserves are included in operating results in the year of adjustment. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had $392.7 &#32;million and $406.6 &#32;million, respectively, accrued for claims and insurance.

Stock Compensation Plans 

We have various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in the &#8220;Stock Compensation Plans&#8221; footnote to our consolidated financial statements. We recognize compensation costs for non-vested shares and compensation cost for all share-based payments ( i.e., &#32;options) based on the grant date fair value. For our share-based payments granted, with no performance requirement, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (generally three to four years) based on the grant-date fair value. For our performance-based awards, the Company expenses the grant date fair value of the awards which are probable of being earned in the performance period over the respective service period.

Revenue equipment

Technology equipment and software

Other 

3 - 10 

We charge maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred and betterments are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining lease term. 

Our investment in technology equipment and software consists primarily of freight movement, automation, dimensioning, sales equipment and related software. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , depreciation expense was $145.5 &#32;million, $145.1 &#32;million and $153.8 &#32;million, respectively. 

The cost of replacement tires are expensed at the time those tires are placed into service, as is the case with other repair and maintenance costs. The cost of tires on newly acquired revenue equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related equipment. In addition to purchasing new revenue equipment, we will also rebuild the engines of our tractors (at certain time or mile intervals). Because rebuilding an engine increases its useful life, we capitalize these costs and depreciate over the remaining useful life of the unit. The cost of engines on newly acquired revenue equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related equipment. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

If facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of held-and-used identifiable amortizable intangibles and property, plant and equipment may be impaired, we perform an evaluation of recoverability in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360. Our evaluation compares the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group to its carrying amount to determine if a reduction to the carrying amount is required. The carrying amount of an impaired asset would be reduced to fair value if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group. We performed impairment reviews for held-and-used long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 in connection with an update of our internal business forecasts that considered current economic conditions and results of operations. 

Assets Held for Sale 

When we plan to dispose of property or equipment by sale, the asset is carried in the financial statements at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less cost to sell, and is reclassified to assets held for sale. Additionally, after such reclassification, there is no further depreciation taken on the asset. For an asset to be classified as held for sale, management must approve and commit to a formal plan, the sale should be anticipated during the ensuing year and the asset must be actively marketed, be available for immediate sale, and meet certain other specified criteria. We use level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of each property that is considered as held for sale. 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , the net book value of assets held for sale was approximately $12.0 million &#32;and $15.3 million , respectively. This amount is included in &#8220;Property and Equipment&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We recorded charges of $6.2 million , $6.2 million &#32;and $3.9 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, to reduce properties held for sale to estimated fair value, less cost to sell. These charges are included in &#8220;Gains on property disposals, net&#8221; in the accompanying statements of consolidated operations. 

Equity Method Investments 

On October 23, 2015, the Company entered into an equity interest sale and purchase agreement to sell its fifty percent interest in its Chinese joint venture, JHJ, for a purchase price of $16.3 million , which we expect, upon sale, will result in an insignificant gain in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations due to the cumulative translation adjustment. The investment is classified as held for sale and is included in &#8220;Other assets&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 

We account for the ownership of our joint venture under the equity method and accordingly, recognize our share of the respective joint ventures earnings in &#8220;Other nonoperating (income) expense&#8221; in the accompanying statements of operations. 

The following reflects the components of these results for the years ended December 31 :

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

We determined fair value measurements used in our consolidated financial statements based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity&#8217;s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

&#8226; 

Level 1: &#32;Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access. 

&#8226; 

Level 2: &#32;Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

&#8226; 

Level 3: &#32;Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The asset&#8217;s or liability&#8217;s fair value measurement level with the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

The valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial assets could result 

in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . 

The following tables summarize the fair value hierarchy of our financial assets held at fair value on a recurring basis, which consists of our restricted cash held in escrow:

Reclassifications Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we reclassified the amortization of our net pension gain (loss), net of tax, totaling $14.1 million &#32;and $12.7 million , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income (loss). This reclassification is a component of net periodic pension cost and is discussed in the &#8220;Employee Benefits&#8221; footnote. 

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In November 2015, Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The new standard will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual period. The ASU allows entities to choose either prospective or retrospective transition. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its balance sheet. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Deferral of the Effective date, &#32;which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The new standard will supersede much of the previous requirements in ASU-605, Revenue Recognition and most industry specific guidance and introduces a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The premise of the new model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will be effective for the Company for its annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted for annual periods beginning January 1, 2017. Entities are allowed to transition to the new standard by either recasting prior periods or recognizing the cumulative effect. The Company continues to assess the method of application and impact, if any, on our consolidated balance sheets, results of operations and related disclosures. 

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) , which eliminates the requirement to categorize investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in accordance with the standard 

for fair value measurement. The standard, which requires retrospective application, is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its disclosure. 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest, &#32;which requires debt issue costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the accounting treatment for debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance of debt issuance costs are not affected by this update. The standard, which requires retrospective application, is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $20.2 million &#32;and $26.5 million , respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs related to its Term Loan, Second A&#38;R CDA, ABL Facility and lease financing obligations. The Company will reclassify these costs from other assets to long-term debt in the March 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheets. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . The new standard provides guidance around management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist of our tradenames, are not subject to amortization, but are subjected to an impairment test at least annually or more frequently if a triggering event occurs. The impairment test for tradenames consists of a comparison of the fair value of the tradename with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. In making this assessment, we utilized the relief from royalty method, an income approach (a level 3 fair value measurement), which includes assumptions as to future revenue, applicable royalty rate and cost of capital, among others.

5. Employee Benefits 

Qualified and Nonqualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans 

YRC Worldwide and certain of our operating subsidiaries sponsor qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for certain employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements (approximately 10,000 &#32;current, former and retired employees). Qualified and nonqualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the employees&#8217; covered earnings. Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements participate in various multi-employer pension plans to which YRC Worldwide contributes, as discussed below. Regional Transportation does not offer a defined benefit pension plan and instead offers retirement benefits through either contributory 401(k) savings plans or profit sharing plans, as discussed below. The domestic YRC Worldwide defined benefit pension plans closed to new participants effective January 1, 2004 and the benefit accrual for active employees was frozen effective July 1, 2008. Our actuarial valuation measurement date for our pension plans is December 31. 

Funded Status 

The reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the funded status at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , is as follows:

The underfunded status of the plans of $335.6 million &#32;and $455.9 million &#32; at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, is recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as shown in the table below. No plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during the year ending December 31, 2016 . 

Our long-term strategy is to reduce the risk of our underfunded plans. The Company amended its domestic pension plans and offered a one-time voluntary lump sum payment option in an effort to reduce its long-term pension obligations and ongoing annual pension expense. The lump sum pension settlement payments of $85.2 million , which are reflected in &#8220;Benefits paid&#8221; in the above table, were funded from existing pension plan assets. In connection with this transaction, the Company incurred a settlement charge of $28.7 million &#32;to salaries, wages and employee benefits expense as a result of the requirement to expense the unrecognized actuarial losses associated with the lump sum settlements. The charge had no effect on equity because the actuarial losses were already recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Accordingly, the effect on retained earnings was offset by a corresponding reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The discount rate refers to the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments to their present value, also referred to as the benefit obligation. The discount rate allows us to estimate what it would cost to settle the pension obligations as of the measurement date, December 31 , and is used as the interest rate factor in the following year&#8217;s pension cost. We determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality noncallable bonds such that the coupons and maturities exceed our expected benefit payments. 

In determining the expected rate of return on assets, we consider our historical experience in the plans&#8217; investment portfolio, historical market data and long-term historical relationships as well as a review of other objective indices including current market factors such as inflation and interest rates. Although plan investments are subject to short-term market volatility, we believe they are well diversified and closely managed. 

Our asset allocation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and targeted long-term asset allocation for the plans are as follows:

Based on various market factors, we selected an expected rate of return on assets of 7.0% &#32;effective for the 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;valuations. We will continue to review our expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revise appropriately. The pension trust holds no YRC Worldwide securities. 

Future Contributions and Benefit Payments 

We expect to contribute approximately $45.3 million &#32;to our single-employer pension plans in 2016 . 

Expected benefit payments from our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for each of the next five years and the total benefit payments for the following five years ended December 31 are as follows:

Fair Value Measurement 

Our pension assets are stated at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of Level 1 assets are based on quoted market prices. The majority of the Level 1 assets presented in the table below include common stock of both U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international companies, and mutual funds, of which are actively traded and priced in the market. The fair value of Level 2 assets are based on other significant observable inputs, including quoted prices for similar securities. The Level 2 assets presented in the below table consist primarily of fixed income and absolute return funds where values are based on the NAV of the underlying investments held, as determined by the fund managers, or equity securities where values are based on the quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data. Level 3 assets are those where the fair value is determined based on unobservable inputs. The Level 3 assets presented in the table below consist of alternative investments where active market pricing is not readily available and, as such, we use NAV as an estimate of fair value. For the remaining Level 3 assets that do not use NAV to estimate fair value, which consists of private equities, the assets are either priced at cost less cash distributions for recent asset purchases, third-party valuations or discounted cash flow methods. The methods and assumptions used by third-party pricing sources may include a variety of factors, such as recently executed transactions, existing contracts, economic conditions, industry or market developments, and overall credit ratings. 

These estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed and as such, differences could be material. There were no transfers among the fair value hierarchy levels for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

The table below details by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the pension assets at fair value as of December 31, 2015 :

These assets consist of equity, fixed income, and absolute return funds. Generally, the investment strategies of the fixed income and equity funds is based on fundamental and quantitative analysis and consists of long and hedged strategies. The general strategy of the absolute return funds consists of alternative investment techniques, including derivative instruments and other unconventional assets, to achieve a stated return rate. 

Multi-Employer Pension Plans 

YRC Freight, New Penn, Holland and Reddaway contribute to various separate multi-employer health, welfare and pension plans for employees that are covered by our collective bargaining agreements (approximately 78% &#32;of total Company employees). The collective bargaining agreements determine the amounts of these contributions. The health and welfare plans provide medical related benefits to active employees and retirees. The pension plans provide defined benefits to retired participants. We recognize as net pension cost within &#8216;salaries, wages and employee benefits&#8217; the contractually required contributions for the period and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid at period end. We do not directly manage multi-employer plans. The trusts covering these plans are generally managed by trustees, half of whom the unions appoint and half of whom various contributing employers appoint. 

We expensed the following amounts related to these plans for the years ended December 31:

Through the third quarter of 2009, we deferred payment of certain of our contributions to multi-employer pension funds. These deferred payments have been recognized as an operating expense and the liability was recorded as deferred contribution obligations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2009 through May 2011, most of our collective bargaining agreements provided for a temporary cessation of pension contributions so no expense or liability was required to be recognized for that period. In accordance with modifications to our collective bargaining agreements, we agreed to resume making pension contributions effective June 1, 2011 at 25.0% &#32;of the contribution rate in effect as of July 1, 2009.

The determination of individually significant multi-employer plans is based on the relative contributions to the plans over the periods presented as well as other factors.

The Pension Protection Zone Status is based on information that the Company obtained from the plans&#8217; Forms 5500. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available for 2015 and 2014 is for the plan&#8217;s year-end during calendar years 2014 and 2013, respectively. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. 

(c) &#160; 

The policies of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust precluded the Company from reentering the plan on June 1, 2011. The plan did not assess a withdrawal liability and has not done so since June 1, 2011. Contributions related to the employees previously covered by this plan are now being made to the Teamsters National 401(k) Plan.

In 2015, we received notice from these funds that they are now in Critical and Declining status. 

YRC Worldwide was listed in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, Road Carriers Local 707 Pension Fund, Central Pennsylvania Teamsters Defined Benefit Plan and Teamsters Local 641 Pension Fund&#8217;s Forms 5500 as providing more than 5 percent of the total contributions for 2014 and 2013. 

We contributed a total of $89.4 million , $91.6 million &#32;and $88.7 million &#32;to the multi-employer pension funds for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 .

In 2006, the Pension Protection Act became law and modified both the Code as it applies to multi-employer pension plans and the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as amended, &#8220;ERISA&#8221;). The Code and ERISA (in each case, as so modified) and related regulations establish minimum funding requirements for multi-employer pension plans. 

In 2014, the MPRA became law which modified the ability to suspend accrued benefits of plans facing insolvency by adding a new zone status of Critical and Declining. 

If any of our multi-employer pension plans fails to meet minimum funding requirements, meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation plan that the Pension Protection Act may require for certain of our underfunded plans, obtain from the IRS certain changes to or a waiver of the requirements in how the applicable plan calculates its funding levels, or reduce pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met then we could be required to make additional contributions to the pension plan. If any of our multi-employer pension plans enters critical status or worse and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan schedule, the Pension Protection Act could require us to make additional surcharge contributions to the multi-employer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement for the remaining term of the labor agreement. 

In 2015, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Pension Plan filed an application under MPRA with the Department of Treasury requesting the approval of a benefit suspension plan. The plan will have to be evaluated and approved by the Department of Treasury in concert with Department of Labor and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (&#8220;PBGC&#8221;) before being submitted to a vote of participants. If ultimately approved, the plan would require future employer contribution increases to the plan. 

If we fail to make our required contributions to a multi-employer plan under a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, it would expose us to penalties including potential withdrawal liability. If the benchmarks that an applicable funding improvement or rehabilitation plan provides are not met by the end of a prescribed period, the IRS could impose an excise tax on us and the plan&#8217;s other contributing employers. These excise taxes are not contributed to the deficient funds, but rather are deposited in the United States general treasury funds. The Company does not believe that the temporary cessation of certain of its contributions to applicable multi-employer pension funds beginning in the third quarter of 2009 and continuing through May 2011 will give rise to these excise taxes as the underlying employer contributions were not required for that period. 

A requirement to materially increase contributions beyond our contractually agreed rate or the imposition of an excise tax on us could have a material adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of YRC Worldwide. 

401(k) Savings Plans 

We sponsor the YRC Worldwide Inc. 401(k) Plan and the Reddaway Hourly 401(k) Plan, which are defined contribution plans primarily for employees that our collective bargaining agreements do not cover. The plans permit participants to make contributions to the plans and permit the employer of participants to make contributions on behalf of the participants. Additionally, the Reddaway Hourly 401(k) Plan allows for a non-elective employer contribution. Including non-elective employer contributions, there were total employer contributions of $4.7 million &#32;in 2015 , $2.1 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and no &#32;employer contributions in 2013 . Our employees covered under collective bargaining agreements may also participate in union-sponsored 401(k) plans. 

Performance Incentive Awards 

We provide annual performance incentive awards and more frequent sales incentive awards to certain non-union employees, which are based primarily on actual operating results achieved compared to targeted operating results or sales targets and are paid in cash. Operating income in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;included performance and sales incentive expense for non-union employees of $13.2 million , $13.9 million &#32;and $8.2 million , respectively. We generally pay annual performance incentive awards in the first quarter of the following year and sales performance incentive awards on a monthly basis. 

We also provide short-term performance based cash compensation to key management personnel. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , compensation expense related to these awards was $14.1 million , $2.9 million &#32;and $6.3 million , respectively. Refer to the &#8220;Stock Compensation Plans&#8221; footnote for an overview of long-term performance based equity compensation, and related compensation expense, associated with such awards. 

Additionally, operating income in 2015 included a profit sharing bonus for eligible union employees at the Regional Transportation segment of $5.5 million . No such bonus was paid for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.

Credit Facilities 

As of December 31, 2015 we had two primary credit facilities that we utilized to support our liquidity needs: a $700 million &#32;term loan facility and a $450 million &#32;ABL Facility. The ABL Facility is used to support our outstanding letters of credit commitments. We have set forth a brief description of our two primary credit facilities and our other financing arrangements in place at December 31, 2015 below. 

$700 Million First Lien Term Loan 

On February 13, 2014, we entered into and borrowed in full a $700 million &#32;term loan credit agreement (the &#8220;Term Loan Agreement&#8221;), less a 1% &#32;discount, from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions arranged by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) and RBS Citizens, N.A. No amounts under this Term Loan, once repaid, may be reborrowed. On September 25, 2014, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to its Term Loan Agreement, which amended the Term Loan to, among other things, adjust the maximum permitted total leverage ratio through December 31, 2016 and increase the applicable interest rate (subject to the exceptions discussed below) over the same period. Certain material provisions of the Term Loan are summarized below: 

- Maturity and Amortization : The Term Loan matures on February 13, 2019. The Term Loan will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% &#32;of the original principal amount of the Term Loan. 

- &#32;Incremental : Subject to finding current or new lenders willing to provide such commitments, the Company has the right to incur one or more increases to the Term Loan and/or one or more new tranches of term loans (which may be unsecured or secured on a junior basis) to be made available under the Term Loan Agreement which shall not exceed (i) $250 million &#32;so long as the senior secured leverage ratio on a pro forma basis (defined as consolidated total debt that is secured by a lien as of such date over Consolidated EBITDA as of the twelve months ended the most recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements are available) does not exceed 3.25 &#32;to 1.0 , plus (ii) all voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan. 

- Interest and Fees : The Term Loan bears interest, at the election of the borrower, at either the applicable London interbank offer rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) (subject to a floor of 1.00% ) plus a margin of 7.25% &#32;per annum, or a rate determined by reference to the alternate base rate (the greater of the prime rate established by the administrative agent, the federal fund rate plus 0.50% &#32;and one month, LIBOR plus 1.00% ) plus a margin of 6.25% ; provided that such margins will step down by 0.25% &#32;when the Company meets a total leverage ratio of equal or less than 3.25 &#32;to 1.00 . 

- Guarantors : The obligations of the borrower under the Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;Term Guarantors&#8221;). 

- Collateral : The Term Loan is secured by a perfected first priority security interest in (subject to permitted liens) substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors under the Term Loan (the &#8220;Term Guarantors&#8221;), except that accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts and other assets related to accounts receivable are subject to a second priority interest (subject to permitted liens) and certain owned real property securing the obligations under the Second A&#38;R CDA filed January 31, 2014, do not secure the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement (the &#8220;CDA Collateral&#8221;). 

- Mandatory Prepayments : The Term Loan includes the following mandatory prepayments: 

&#8226; 

75% &#32;of excess cash flow (as defined in the Term Loan and paid if permitted under the ABL Facility), subject to step downs to (w) 50% &#32;if the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 &#32;to 1.00 &#32;but greater than 3.50 &#32;to 1.00 , to (x) 25% &#32;if the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.50 &#32;to 1.00 &#32;but greater than 3.00 &#32;to 1.00 &#32;and (y) 0% &#32;if the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 &#32;to 1.00 . 

&#8226; 

100% &#32;of the net cash proceeds of all asset sales or similar dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, casualty events and other limited exceptions under the Term Loan (subject to materiality thresholds and customary reinvestment rights); and 

&#8226; 

100% &#32;of cash proceeds from debt issuances that are not permitted by the Term Loan. 

- Events of Default : The Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary events of default, including but not limited to the failure to make payments due under the Term Loan, breach of and failure to cure the breach of certain covenants, the entry of a final unpaid judgment against any of the Term Guarantors in excess of $30 million , the commencement of certain insolvency proceedings, liquidations or dissolutions, a cross-default to certain other indebtedness with an outstanding aggregate principal balance of at least $30 million &#32;(other than the ABL Facility), and cross-acceleration to the ABL Facility. 

- Covenants : The Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, covenants restricting the incurrences of debt, liens, the making of investments and repurchases, transactions with affiliates, fundamental changes and asset sales, and prepayments of junior debt. In addition, refer to the &#8220;Credit Facility Covenants&#8221; section below for financial covenants for each of the remaining test periods. 

$450 Million ABL Facility 

On February 13, 2014, we entered into our $450 million &#32;ABL Facility from a syndicate of banks arranged by RBS Citizens, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith and CIT Finance LLC. The ABL Facility terminates on February 13, 2019. YRC Worldwide, YRC Freight, Reddaway, Holland and New Penn are borrowers under the ABL Facility, and certain of the Company&#8217;s domestic subsidiaries are guarantors thereunder. Certain material provisions of the ABL Facility are summarized below and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the definitive documentation: 

- Availability : The aggregate amount available under the ABL Facility cannot be more than (a) the collateral line cap minus (b) the facility exposure. The facility exposure refers to the aggregate amount of loans and letter of credit outstanding (with an exclusion for certain fees and other amounts owing for letters of credit). The collateral line cap refers to a limit equal to the greater of (a) the commitments by lenders under the facility and (b) the borrowing base. The borrowing base equals the sum of (a) 85% &#32;of the sum of (i) Eligible Accounts (as defined in the ABL Facility) minus without duplication (ii) the Dilution Reserve (as defined in the ABL Facility relating to reserves for eligible accounts experiencing bad debt write-downs, discounts, allowances and similar dilutive items), plus (b) 100% &#32;of Eligible Borrowing Base Cash (as defined in the ABL Facility which constitutes 85% &#32;of the 

&#8220;deferred revenue liability&#8221; as reflected on the balance sheet of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal month), minus (d) the Availability Reserve (as defined in the ABL Facility) imposed by the agent in its permitted discretion (made in good-faith and using reasonable business judgment) to reduce the amount of the borrowing base in light of predetermined criteria set forth in the ABL Facility. 

- Eligible Borrowing Base Cash : The eligible borrowing base cash is cash that is deposited from time to time into a segregated restricted account maintained at the agent over which the agent has dominion. Such cash can only be withdrawn by us from the account if (i) no event of default exists or would arise as a result of the borrowing base cash release and (ii) availability as of the proposed date of such borrowing base cash release is not less than 15% &#32;of the collateral line cap. Eligible borrowing base cash is included in &#8220;Restricted amounts held in escrow&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

- Interest : Revolving loans made under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the Company&#8217;s election, of either the applicable LIBOR rate plus 2.5% &#32;or the base rate (the greater of the prime rate established by the agent, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% &#32;and one month LIBOR plus 1.00% ). Thereafter, the interest rates will be subject to the following price grid based on the average quarterly excess availability under the revolver:

The rates set forth above are subject to a 0.25% &#32;reduction during any fiscal quarter for which the Company has a total leverage ratio of less than 2.50 &#32;to 1.00 . We have not drawn on the facility at any time during the agreement. 

- Letter of Credit Fees : The ABL Facility has certain specific fees relating to letters of credit which include: (i) fees payable quarterly in arrears equal to the applicable margin in effect for revolving loans (which is listed in the &#8220;Interest&#8221; description immediately above) multiplied by the average daily stated amount of letters of credit ( 2.5% &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 ), (ii) fronting fees for letters of credit payable quarterly in arrears equal to 0.125% &#32;of the stated amount of the letters of credit and (iii) fees to issuing banks to compensate for customary charges related to the issuance and administration of letters of credit. 

- Other Fees : Other fees in respect of the ABL Facility include an unused line fee payable quarterly in arrears calculated by multiplying the amount by which the commitments exceed the loans and letters of credit for any calendar quarter by the unused line fee percentage (such unused line fee percentage initially to 0.25% &#32;per annum through March 31, 2014, and thereafter 0.375% &#32;per annum if the average revolver usage is less than 50% &#32;or 0.25% &#32;per annum if the average revolver usage is greater than 50% ). 

- Collateral : The obligations under the ABL Facility are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in (subject to permitted liens) all accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts and other assets related to accounts receivable of the Company and the other loan parties and an additional second priority security interest in (subject to permitted liens) substantially all remaining assets of the borrowers and the guarantors other than CDA Collateral. 

- Incremental : The Facility provides for a $100 million &#32;uncommitted accordion to increase the revolving commitment in the future to support borrowing base growth. 

- Events of Default : The ABL Facility contains certain customary events of default, including but not limited to the failure to make payments due under the ABL Facility, breach of and failure to cure the breach of certain covenants, the entry of a final unpaid judgment against any of the ABL Facility loan parties in excess of $30 million , the commencement of any insolvency proceeding, liquidation or dissolution, and a cross-default to certain other indebtedness with an outstanding aggregate principal balance of at least $30 million &#32;(including the Term Loan). 

- Covenants : The ABL Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants (including certain customary provisions regarding borrowing base reporting, and including, among others, covenants restricting the incurrences of debt, liens, the making of investments and repurchases, transactions with affiliates, fundamental changes and asset sales, and prepayments of junior debt). Certain of the covenants relating to investments, restricted payments and capital expenditures are relaxed upon meeting specified payment conditions or debt repayment conditions, as applicable. Payment conditions include (i) the absence of an event 

of default arising from such transaction, (ii) liquidity of at least $100 million &#32;or availability of at least $67.5 million &#32;and (iii) the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the most recent term period on a pro forma basis is equal to or greater than 1.10 &#32;to 1.00 ). Debt repayment conditions include (i) the absence of an event of default from repaying such debt and (ii) availability on the date of repayment is not less than $67.5 million . During any period commencing when the ABL Facility borrowers fail to maintain availability in an amount at least equal to 10% &#32;of the collateral line cap and until the borrowers have maintained availability of at least 10% &#32;of the collateral line cap for 30 &#32;consecutive calendar days, the ABL Facility loan parties are required to maintain a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.10 &#32;to 1.00 . The &#8220;Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio&#8221; is defined as (a) (i) consolidated adjusted EBITDA for such period, minus (ii) capital expenditures made during such period, minus (iii) the aggregate amount of net cash taxes paid in cash during such period, minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which the cash pension contribution for such period exceeds the pension expense for such period, and plus (v) the amount, if any, by which the pension expense for such period exceeds the cash pension contribution for such period, divided by (b) the consolidated fixed charges for such period. In addition, refer to the &#8220;Credit Facility Covenants&#8221; section of this footnote for covenants for each of the remaining test periods. 

Second Amended and Restated Contribution Deferral Agreement 

- Overview : Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to the Amended and Restated Contribution Deferral Agreement (the &#8220;A&#38;R CDA&#8221;) with certain multiemployer pension funds named therein (collectively, the &#8220;Funds&#8221;) pursuant to which we are permitted to continue to defer pension payments and deferred interest owed to such Funds as of July 22, 2011 (each, &#8220;Deferred Pension Payments&#8221; and &#8220;Deferred Interest&#8221;). The A&#38;R CDA was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2015 t hough the Company entered into the Second A&#38;R CDA on January 31, 2014, which extended the maturity to December 31, 2019. There is no mandatory amortization prior to that time. The Deferred Pension Payments and Deferred Interest (each as defined in the A&#38;R CDA) bears interest at a fixed rate, with respect to each Fund, per annum as set forth in its trust documentation as of February 28, 2011. 

- Application of Certain Payments : Pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries began making contributions to the Funds for the month beginning June 1, 2011 at the rate of 25% &#32;of the contribution rate in effect on July 1, 2009. However, legislative changes to current law or other satisfactory action or arrangements are required to enable certain of the Funds (based on their funded status) to accept contributions at a reduced rate. 

In accordance with the re-entry arrangements between each Fund and the primary obligors, a Fund may require the primary obligors to make payments of obligations owed to such Fund under the A&#38;R CDA in lieu of payments required pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT or make payments into an escrow arrangement, in each case in an amount equal to such Fund&#8217;s current monthly contribution amount. 

- Collateral : Under the A&#38;R CDA, the Funds maintain their first lien on existing first priority collateral. The Funds allowed the secured parties under the Series A Notes and Series B Notes (as each are described below) a second lien behind the secured parties to the credit agreement on certain properties and the Funds had a third lien on such collateral. However, under the Second A&#38;R CDA, such third lien on certain properties was released on the collateral release date upon the occurrence of events specified therein. 

2014 Financing Transaction 

On January 31, 2014, we issued 14,333,334 &#32;shares of our Common Stock and 583,334 &#32;shares of our Class A Preferred Stock pursuant to certain stock purchase agreements, dated as of December 22, 2013 (the &#8220;Stock Purchase Agreements&#8221;), for an aggregate $250.0 million &#32;in cash. We used the proceeds from these transactions to, among other things, (i) deposit with the trustee funds sufficient to repay our 6% &#32;Notes at their maturity on February 15, 2014 and (ii) repurchase approximately $90.9 million &#32;of our Series A Notes. In February 2014, the Company deposited approximately $89.6 million &#32;with the trustee to fund the redemption (including accrued interest), and thereby discharged the indenture governing the Series A Notes. The Company used the cash deposited with the trustee to redeem its Series A Notes on August 5, 2014. 

Also on January 31, 2014, certain holders of our Series B Notes exchanged their outstanding balances (including the make-whole premium and additional accrued interest through January 15, 2014) at a price of $15.00 &#32;per share, while certain other holders converted their Series B Notes in accordance with their terms. We also amended the indenture governing our Series B Notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and other related provisions contained in the indenture and to release and discharge the liens on the collateral securing the Series B Notes. 

Effective January 31, 2014, certain of our subsidiaries, various pension funds party thereto, and Wilmington Trust Company, as agent for such pension funds, entered into the Second A&#38;R CDA, which, among other things (i) amended and restated the A&#38;R

On February 13, 2014, we replaced our existing credit facilities with a new $450 million &#32;ABL Facility and a new $700 million &#32;Term Loan. The ABL Facility will be used to support our outstanding letters of credit commitments.

We accounted for the A&#38;R CDA maturity extension as a debt modification and the remaining transactions as extinguishment of debt and issuance of new debt. We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $11.2 million &#32;associated with this transaction during the year ended December 31, 2014, $16.3 million &#32;of which related to the acceleration of net premiums on our old debt, partially offset by $5.1 million &#32;of additional expense related to the fair value of the incremental shares provided to those Series B Note holders who exchanged their outstanding balances at a price of $15.00 &#32;per share. We recorded, in &#8220;interest expense&#8221; on the statements of consolidated comprehensive income (loss), $8.0 million &#32;of make-whole interest related to the Series B Notes exchanged during the year ended December 31, 2014. We paid $43.8 million &#32;of fees associated with these transactions of which $26.7 million &#32;was recorded as unamortized deferred debt costs in &#8220;other assets&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized as interest expense over the term of the Term Loan and ABL Facility and $17.1 million &#32;offset the equity proceeds of our stock purchase agreements. 

On March 14, 2014, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved amending our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 95.0 million &#32;shares and to allow an investor involved in the 2014 Financing Transactions to own more than 19.99% &#32;of outstanding Common Stock. Upon approval of these amendments, each outstanding share of Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into four shares of Common Stock and the Company recorded 18.1 million &#32;related to the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature on preferred stock on the statements of consolidated operations. 

Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 

Our prior amended and restated credit agreement provided for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $307.4 million &#32;and a letter of credit facility of up to $437.0 million . As discussed, we extinguished the Prior Term Loan on February 13, 2014. 

Prior ABL Facility 

Our Prior ABL Facility provided for a $175.0 million &#32;ABL first-out delayed draw term loan facility and a $225.0 million &#32;ABL last-out term loan facility. As discussed, we extinguished the Prior ABL Facility on February 13, 2014. 

Series A Convertible Senior Secured Notes 

On July 22, 2011, we issued $140.0 million &#32;in aggregate principal of our Series A Notes that bore interest at a stated rate of 10% &#32;per year and matured on March 31, 2015. Interest was payable on a semiannual basis in arrears only in-kind through the issuance of additional Series A Notes. As discussed in the &#8220;2014 Financing Transactions &#8221; &#32;section, on February 13, 2014, the Company deposited approximately $89.6 million &#32;(including accrued interest) with the trustee in order to fund the redemption of the remaining Series A Notes, thereby discharging the indenture governing the Series A Notes. The Company used the cash deposited with the trustee to redeem its Series A Notes on August 5, 2014. There were no conversions at any time of our Series A Notes. 

6% Convertible Senior Notes 

On February 11, 2010, we entered into a note purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which such investors agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to purchase up to $70 million &#32;of our 6% Notes. The outstanding 6% Notes were paid at maturity on February 15, 2014. These 6% &#32;Notes bore interest at 6% &#32;which was payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. There were no conversions of our 6% Notes. 

Series B Convertible Senior Secured Notes 

On July 22, 2011, we issued $100.0 million &#32;in aggregate principal of our Series B Notes that bore interest at a stated rate of 10.0% &#32;per year and matured on March 31, 2015. Interest was payable on a semiannual basis in arrears only in-kind through the issuance of additional Series B Notes. 

On March 25, 2015, we entered into an exchange agreement with certain holders of our Series B Notes to exchange their outstanding principal and accrued interest balances totaling $17.9 million &#32;at conversion price of $18.00 &#32;per share for an aggregate 994,689 shares of Common Stock. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded $0.6 million &#32;of additional expense related to the fair value of the incremental shares provide to those holders who exchanged their outstanding balances. At maturity on March 31, 2015, we repaid the holders of the remaining outstanding Series B Notes approximately $0.3 million &#32;of cash. 

As discussed in the &#8220;2014 Financing Transactions &#8221; section, on January 31, 2014, certain holders of our Series B Notes exchanged their outstanding balances as part of an exchange agreement. Not including the exchanges made as part of our 2014 Financing Transactions, during the year ended December 31, 2014, $1.2 million &#32;of aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes converted into 75,900 &#32;shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, we recorded $0.4 million &#32;of additional interest expense representing the $0.2 million &#32;make whole premium and $0.2 million &#32;of accelerated amortization of the discount on Series B Notes converted.

The fair values of the Term Loan, ABL Facility, and Secured and Unsecured A&#38;R CDA (included in &#8220;Other&#8221; above) were estimated based on observable prices (level two inputs for fair value measurements). The fair value of the lease financing obligations is estimated using a publicly traded secured loan with similar characteristics (level three input for fair value measurement). 

Liquidity 

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our ABL Facility and any prospective net cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $173.8 million &#32;and the borrowing base and maximum availability on our ABL Facility were $441.7 million &#32;and $79.7 million , respectively. The maximum availability is calculated in accordance with the terms of the ABL Facility and is derived by reducing the borrowing base by our $362.0 million &#32;of outstanding letters of credit. While our ABL Facility permits us to access maximum availability outside of certain financial covenant restrictions (which restrictions did not limit our availability as of December 31, 2015), the maximum amount we expect to access on our ABL Facility at any time is maximum availability less the lower of 10% of the borrowing base ( $44.2 million &#32;at December 31, 2015) or 10% of the collateral line cap ( $45.0 million &#32;at December 31, 2015). Thus, of the $79.7 million &#32;in maximum availability, our Managed Accessibility was $35.5 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015. As a result, we had cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility of $209.3 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $171.1 million &#32;and the borrowing base and maximum availability on our ABL Facility were $445.5 million &#32;and $71.2 million , respectively. The maximum availability is calculated in accordance with the terms of the ABL Facility and is derived by reducing the borrowing base by our $374.3 million &#32;of outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2014, amounts able to be drawn on our ABL Facility (which were limited by certain financial covenant restrictions) were $27.1 million , for a total of cash and cash equivalents and amounts able to be drawn on our ABL Facility of $198.2 million . 

Outside of funding normal operations, our principal uses of cash include making contributions to our single-employer pension plans and various multi-employer pension funds, and meeting our other cash obligations, including, but not limited to, paying principal and interest on our funded debt, payments on equipment leases and funding capital expenditures. 

Credit Facility Covenants 

The Term Loan Agreement governing our Term Loan has certain financial covenants, as amended in September 2014, that, among other things, restricts certain capital expenditures and requires us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio (defined as Consolidated Total Debt divided by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined below). 

Our total maximum leverage ratio covenants are as follows:

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, defined in our Term Loan Agreement as &#8220;Consolidated EBITDA,&#8221; is a measure that reflects our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, and is further adjusted for, among other things, letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals and certain other items, including restructuring professional fees, expenses associated with certain lump sum payments to our IBT employees and the results of permitted dispositions and discontinued operations. Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in our Term Loan Agreement, is the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Our total leverage ratio for the year ending December 31, 2015 &#32;was 3.25 &#32;to 1.00. Additionally, our ABL Facility credit agreement, among other things, restricts certain capital expenditures. 

Capital Expenditures/Operating Leases 

Our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were $108.0 million &#32;and $69.2 million , respectively. These amounts were principally used to fund the purchase of used tractors and trailers, to refurbish engines for our revenue fleet and for capitalized costs for our service center facilities and technology infrastructure. 

Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2015 , we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment totaling $130.9 million , with such payments to be made over the average lease term of 4 years . The capital value of this revenue equipment, which excludes our recurring leases for sleeper units, totals $131.7 million . During 2014 , we entered into new operating lease commitments for revenue equipment of $65.0 million , with such lease payments to be made over the average lease term of 5 years . The capital value of this equipment totals $72.4 million . As of December 31, 2015 , our operating lease obligations for 2016 are $80.0 million . As of December 31, 2015 , our operating lease obligations through 2025 totaled $269.0 million &#32;and are expected to increase as we lease additional revenue equipment in future years. 

7. Stock Compensation Plans 

We reserved 5.0 million &#32;shares for issuance to key management personnel and directors under the 2011 amended and restated long-term incentive and equity award plan. As of December 31, 2015 , 2.9 million &#32;shares remain available for future issuance under this plan. The plan permits the issuance of restricted stock and stock units, as well as options, stock appreciation rights, and performance stock and performance stock unit awards. Awards under the plan can be satisfied in cash or shares at the discretion of the Board of Directors. According to the plan provisions, the stock units provide the holders the right to receive one share of our Common Stock upon vesting (and distribution) of one stock unit. The plan requires the exercise price of any option granted to equal the closing market price of our Common Stock on the date of grant. 

Stock Options 

On March 1, 2010, we formalized the Second Union Employee Option Plan that provided for a grant of up to 31,000 &#32;options, including the effect of the reverse stock split, to purchase our Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $3,600.00 &#32;per share, of which all have been granted. As a part of the union wage reduction, we agreed to award a certain equity interest to all effected union employees. These options vested immediately, will expire 10 &#32;years from the grant date, and were exercisable upon shareholder approval, which was received on June 29, 2010, at our annual shareholder meeting. There has been no activity in these stock options and these options had no intrinsic value as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 . 

Performance Based Awards 

On March 9, 2015, the Company granted performance stock unit awards (&#8220;2015 Performance Awards&#8221;) to employees under its 2015 long-term incentive plan (&#8220;2015 LTIP&#8221;). The awards provide a target number of stock units that vest equally over three years , with the first vesting occurring in February 2016. In addition to meeting service conditions, the number of performance stock units to be received depends on the attainment of defined Company-wide performance goals for 2015 based on adjusted return on invested capital over a one year &#32;performance period. 

A summary of performance based unvested stock unit activity at target is as follows:

The Company expenses the grant date fair value of the awards earned in the performance period over the respective service periods. The intrinsic value of unvested shares as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was $6.0 million . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company recognized compensation expense of $3.9 million . Unrecognized compensation expense related to performance based awards of $3.7 million &#32;is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.8 years .

Certain of the directors have deferred receipt of the Common Stock underlying some or all of the restricted stock units they have been awarded until each such director ceases to serve on the Board or, under certain circumstances, upon a change of control. Thus, while some of these restricted stock units have vested, the directors have not yet received the underlying Common Stock. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the total number of restricted stock units that are vested but for which the underlying Common Stock has not been distributed was 275,000 , 221,000 , and 175,000 , respectively; these shares are shown as unvested in the above table. 

The intrinsic value of unvested shares as of December 31, 2015 was $10.9 million . The Company records expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , the Company recorded compensation expense for restricted stock awards of $4.8 million , $14.4 million , and $5.8 million , respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards of $4.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 &#32;year.

The fair value of nonvested shares is determined based on the closing trading price of our shares on the grant date. The fair value of shares vested and distributed during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 &#32;was $9.5 million &#32;and $7.2 million , respectively. The fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2013 was not significant. 

The outstanding awards under our stock compensation plans provide dividend participation features and are considered participating securities in our earnings per share calculation. 

8. Income Taxes 

We use the asset and liability method to reflect income taxes on our financial statements, pursuant to ASC 740. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates to the differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and to loss carryforwards. Tax credit carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the change occurs. We assess the validity of deferred tax assets and loss and tax credit carryforwards and provide valuation allowances when we determine it is more likely than not that such assets, losses, or credits will not be realized. We have not recognized deferred taxes relative to foreign subsidiaries&#8217; earnings that are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Any related taxes associated with such earnings are not material.

Deemed ownership changes that occurred in July 2011, in July 2013 and in January 2014 imposed annual and cumulative limits under the Code on the utilization of these carryforwards. These limits are estimated to allow only $465.5 million &#32;of these losses to be used over their carry forward periods. These carryforwards expire between 2028 and 2035 if not used. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company has foreign tax credit and other credit carryforwards of approximately $13.2 million , none of which will likely be utilized due to the Code limitations described above, and which will expire between 2016 and 2018 if not used. 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , a valuation allowance of $470.5 million &#32;and $494.5 million &#32;has been established for deferred tax assets because, based on available sources of future taxable income, it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized.

During 2015 and 2013, the Company recognized $11.7 million &#32;and $41.7 million , respectively, of deferred benefit in the Statement of Consolidated Operations and an equal and offsetting deferred tax expense in other comprehensive income included in the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Loss due to the application of intraperiod tax allocation rules under ASC 740. There was no deferred benefit recognized in 2014, as the intraperiod tax allocation rules did not apply. This allocation has no effect on total tax provision or total valuation allowance. 

YRC Worldwide applies the intraperiod tax allocation rules of ASC 740 to allocate income taxes among continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other comprehensive income (loss), and additional paid-in capital when our situation meets the criteria as prescribed in the rule.

23.1 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , there are $7.6 million &#32;and $11.6 million &#32;of benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We accrued interest of $2.0 million &#32;and $1.1 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 &#32;and reversed $3.3 

million &#32;and $11.2 million &#32;of previously accrued interest on uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 &#32;for a net reduction of $1.3 million &#32;and $10.1 million &#32;for 2015 and 2014. The reversal related primarily to settlements and other favorable resolution of prior uncertain positions. The total amount of interest accrued for uncertain tax positions is $3.1 million &#32;and $4.4 million &#32;as of as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 . During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we paid tax of $1.1 million &#32;and interest of $0.1 million &#32;to settle certain state and foreign audits of tax years 2006 through 2011 for certain of our subsidiaries and we reduced our previously recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly. We have not accrued any penalties relative to uncertain tax positions. We have elected to treat interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as interest expense and other operating expenses, respectively. 

&#160; 

It is reasonably possible that the existing unrecognized tax benefits may decrease over the next twelve months by as much as $3.2 million &#32;as a result of developments in examinations and/or litigation, or from the expiration of statutes of limitation.

9. Business Segments 

We report financial and descriptive information about our reportable operating segments on a basis consistent with that used internally for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to segments. We evaluate performance primarily on operating income and return on invested capital. 

We charge management fees and other corporate services to our segments based upon usage or on an overhead allocation basis. Corporate and other operating losses represent operating expenses of the holding company, including compensation and benefits and professional services for all periods presented. Corporate identifiable assets primarily refer to cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and deferred debt issuance costs as well as our investment in JHJ. Intersegment revenue relates to transportation services between our segments. 

Revenue from foreign sources totaled $116.5 million , $137.5 million , and $139.5 million &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and is mainly derived from Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. Long-lived assets located in foreign countries totaled $6.5 million , $8.7 million &#32;and $12.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 , respectively.

10. Shareholders&#8217; Deficit 

As discussed in the &#8220;Debt and Financing&#8221; footnote, on January 31, 2014, we issued 14,333,334 &#32;shares of our Common Stock and 583,334 &#32;of our Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreements, for an aggregate $250.0 million &#32;in cash. On March 14, 2014, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved amending our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock to 95.0 million &#32;and to allow an investor involved in the 2014 Financing Transactions to own more than 19.99% &#32;of outstanding Common Stock. Upon approval of these amendments, each outstanding share of Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into four shares of Common Stock and the Company recorded $18.1 million &#32;related to the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature on preferred stock on the statements of consolidated comprehensive income (loss). 

In 2011, the Company designated one &#32;of its authorized shares of preferred stock as its Series A Voting Preferred Stock. The Series A Voting Preferred Stock has a $1 &#32;liquidation value and entitles the holder to elect two directors to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. The one &#32;share of Series A Voting Preferred Stock was issued to the IBT on July 22, 2011 in connection with the restructuring. The Series A Voting Preferred Stock was recorded at its liquidation value.

11. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 

We calculate basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing our net earnings (loss) by our weighted-average shares outstanding at the end of the period. The calculation for diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average shares outstanding for our dilutive unvested shares and stock units using the treasury stock method and for our convertible notes using the if-converted method. Our calculations for basic and dilutive earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 &#32;are as follows:

12. Commitments, Contingencies, and Uncertainties 

Financial Matters 

We incur rental expenses under noncancelable lease agreements for certain buildings and operating equipment. Rental expense is charged to &#8220;Operating expense and supplies&#8221; or &#8220;Purchased transportation&#8221; on the accompanying statements of operations. Rental expense was $119.3 million , $98.7 million &#32;and $76.0 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

At December 31, 2015 , we were committed under noncancelable lease agreements requiring minimum annual rentals payable as follows:

We expect in the ordinary course of business that leases will be renewed or replaced as they expire. The leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals and contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index not to exceed certain specified amounts. We record rent expense for our operating leases on a straight-line basis over the base term of the lease agreements. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have $21.2 million &#32;committed for capital expenditures to be completed during 2016. 

Bryant Holdings Securities Litigation 

On February 7, 2011, a putative class action was filed by Bryant Holdings LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between April 24, 2008 and November 2, 2009, inclusive (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;), seeking damages under the federal securities laws for statements and/or omissions allegedly made by us and the individual defendants during the Class Period which plaintiffs claimed to be false and misleading. 

The individual defendants are former officers of our Company. No current officers or directors were named in the lawsuit. The parties participated in voluntary mediation between March 11, 2013 and April 15, 2013. The mediation resulted in the execution of a mutually acceptable settlement agreement by the parties. Plaintiffs&#8217; fourth motion to approve settlement was denied by the district court in October 2015, and the Company continues to consider all options going forward. Substantially all of the payments contemplated by the settlement would be covered by our liability insurance. The self-insured retention on this matter has been accrued. On March 4, 2015, the district court set the case for trial on the individual claims beginning June 6, 2016. 

California Labor Law Change 

In October 2015, California adopted new rules governing the payment of piece-rate compensation. New California Labor Code section 226.2 sets forth requirements for the payment of a separate hourly wage for &#8220;nonproductive&#8221; time worked by piece-rate employees, and separate payment for compensable rest and recovery periods to those employees. The Company continues to assess the impact of this new law and ongoing compliance measures. 

Other Environmental Matters 

Incidental to the Company's business in the ordinary course, our equipment is involved in motor vehicle accidents and experiences damage, mechanical failures and cargo issues. From time to time, these matters result in the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. The Company is sometimes responsible for the clean-up and remediation costs associated with these discharges, depending on local regulations and who is determined to be at fault. In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Company spent approximately $8.1 million , $8.0 million , and $7.9 million , respectively, to comply with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, which included such clean-up and remediation costs. 

Other Legal Matters 

We are involved in other litigation or proceedings that arise in ordinary business activities. When possible, we insure against these risks to the extent we deem prudent, but no assurance can be given that the nature or amount of such insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future legal proceedings. Many of these insurance policies contain self-insured retentions in amounts we deem prudent. Based on our current assessment of information available as of the 

date of these financial statements, we believe that our financial statements include adequate provisions for estimated costs and losses that may be incurred within the litigation and proceedings to which we are a party. 

13. Related Party Transactions 

On February 20, 2013, we entered into an Advisory Agreement with MAEVA Group, LLC (&#8220;MAEVA&#8221;), a company owned and controlled by Harry J. Wilson and of which Mr. Wilson is Chairman and CEO. Mr. Wilson served until March 2, 2014 as a director of the Company appointed by the IBT pursuant to its rights as a holder of the Series A Voting Preferred Stock and was not an independent director of the Company. Under the Advisory Agreement, MAEVA provided advisory, analytical, consulting and other services to us in connection with one or more potential transactions and/or other strategic initiatives. 

We paid MAEVA a $5.5 million &#32;completion fee in January 2014 in connection with the completion of the 2014 Financing Transactions. Additionally in February 2014, we paid MAEVA an incremental fee of $3.5 million &#32;in recognition of its critical role and performance in designing and leading a series of highly complicated, challenging and interdependent transactions that were critical to the Company&#8217;s 2014 Financing Transactions. The term of the Advisory Agreement was extended for the first two months of 2014 in connection with the implementation of the 2014 Financing Transactions. Our entry into the Advisory Agreement and the fees paid to MAEVA in connection with the 2014 Financing Transactions were approved by the independent members of the Board.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of YRC Worldwide Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), YRC Worldwide Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework &#32;(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 18, 2016 &#32;expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 

YRC Worldwide Inc.: 

We have audited YRC Worldwide Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework &#32;(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). YRC Worldwide Inc.&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of the December 31, 2015 annual report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on YRC Worldwide Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In our opinion, YRC Worldwide Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework &#32;(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of YRC Worldwide Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders&#8217; deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 18, 2016 &#32;expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
