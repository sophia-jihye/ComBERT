&#160;

IN GENERAL 

&#160;

We were incorporated on September 12, 2014 in the State of Nevada. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have made significant purchase of assets, namely we purchased our office building in Latvia. We are not a &#8220;blank check company,&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, because we have a specific business plan or purpose. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. We are not a &#8220;shell company&#8221; within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have hard assets and real business operations. 

&#160;

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director, engaging in market research, purchasing our office building in Latvia, entering into supply agreements and generating some revenues. We received our initial funding of $4,000 from our sole officer and director who purchased 4,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share. On September 2, 2015 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $0.04 to 30 independent investors pursuant to an offering on Registration Statement on Form S-1. The Company received proceeds of $40,000.

&#160;

Our financial statements from inception (September 12, 2014) through September 30, 2016 report revenues of $277,474 and net income (loss) of $(36,517). Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.

&#160;

We are a start-up company which is in the business of marketing and distributing Ladies Fashion Handbag products. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations. We completed our offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 which provided funding of $40,000 for the next twelve months. After twelve months period we may need additional financing. Artis Jansons, our President and a Director, has agreed to loan the Company funds, however, he has no firm commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. The Company&#8217;s principal offices are located at 40 Lielais prospekts , Ventspils, LV-3601 Latvia.

&#160;

Our operations to date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include: (i) formation of the Company; (ii) development of our business plan; (iii) market research related to Ladies Fashion Handbag products, and (iv) entering into supply agreements and purchasing our office building in Latvia. We have generated revenues of $277,474 since inception.

OUR PRODUCTS 

&#160;

Brief History of Our Products 

&#160;

A handbag, also purse, pocketbook or pouch in American English, is a handled medium-to-large bag that is often fashionably designed, typically used by women, to hold personal items such as wallet/coins, keys, mobile phone, cosmetics and jewelry, books/e-books, pen and paper, food and beverage such as a water bottle, pepper spray and other items for self-defense, feminine hygiene products, contraceptives, tissues and infant care products, or a hairbrush.

&#160;

The term "purse" originally referred to a small bag for holding coins. In British English, it is still used to refer to a small coin bag. A "handbag" is a larger needed accessory that holds items beyond currency, such as a woman's personal items and emergency survival items. American English typically uses the terms "purse" and "handbag" interchangeably. The term "handbag" began appearing in the early 1900s. Initially, it was most often used to refer to men's hand-luggage. Women's accessory bags grew larger and more complex during that period, and the term was attached to the women's accessory. Handbags are used as fashion accessories as well as functional ones. The verb "handbagging" refers to hitting someone or something with a handbag.

&#160;

Early modern Europeans wore purses for one purpose, to carry coins. Purses were made of soft fabric or leather, and were worn by men as often as ladies; the Scottish sporran is a survival of this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very beautiful handbags. By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape, inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses that would not be bulky or untidy in appearance, so reticules were designed. Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, with wrist straps. Originally popular in France, they crossed over into Britain, where they became known as "indispensables". Men, however, did not adopt the trend. They used purses and pockets, which became popular in men's trousers.

&#160; 

&#160;

According to type of handle, handbags are often categorized as:

&#160;

&#183; Tote: a medium to large bag with two straps and an open top &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Cross-body: one long strap that crosses over the body, with the bag resting at the front by the waist &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Sling bag: one long, wide strap that crosses over the body, with the bag resting on the back &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Shoulder bag: any bag with shoulder-length straps &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Clutch: handleless 

&#160;

Handbags that are designed for specific utilitarian needs include:

&#160;

&#183; Laptop purse: a medium to large bag that contains a padded interior compartment or sleeve for protecting a laptop computer &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Camera bag: for carrying photography equipment &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Gym bag: for carrying toiletry items and the clothing and/or shoes a person intends to use for their workout &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Cosmetic bag: a small bag for holding cosmetics, often made of synthetic waterproof protective material &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Duffle bag: a large cylindrical bag usually used for travel or sports gear, sometimes called a "weekend bag" &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Security bag: protects the carrier from travel theft and includes an invisible stainless steel strap sewn into the fabric and a protectant on the main zipper. 

&#160;

A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of a non-rigid container. The use of bags predates recorded history, with the earliest bags being no more than lengths of animal skin or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material. Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the development of human civilization, as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such as berries or food grains, and to transport more items than could readily by carried in the hands. 

&#160;

In the modern world, bags are ubiquitous, with many people routinely carrying a wide variety of them in the form of cloth or leather briefcases, handbags, and backpacks, and with bags made from more disposable materials such as paper or plastic being used for shopping, and to carry home groceries. A bag may be closable by a zipper, snap fastener, etc., or simply by folding (e.g. in the case of a paper bag). Sometimes a money bag or travel bag has a lock. The bag likely predates the inflexible variant, the basket, and bags usually have the additional advantage over baskets of being fold-able or otherwise compressible to smaller sizes. On the other hand, baskets, being made of more rigid material, may better protect their contents.

&#160;

An empty bag may or may not be very light and foldable to a small size. If it is, this is convenient for carrying it to the place where it is needed, such as a shop, and for storage of empty bags. Bags vary from small ones, like purses, to large ones for use in traveling like a suitcase. The pockets of clothing are also a kind of bag, built into the clothing for the carrying of suitably small objects.

&#160;

Handbag producers are also making environmental breakthroughs. In late 1990s, some of our suppliers began producing handbags made of EEKO, a mainly water-based combination of natural and synthetic rubbers with the look, feel, and colorability of leather. Company management team hopes this new material will eventually replace leather and leather substitutes. Our suppliers also began shipping a new line of handbags made of polypropylene EEKO2, a material that emulates cotton, for products ranging from tote bags to fashion bags.

Current Market 

&#160;

Various industry and market websites have reported that the handbag and purse manufacturing industry has rebounded over the past five years, as world economic conditions have improved and consumers have resumed spending on non-essential items. Additionally, international trade has been a key feature of the industry, as companies that operate in developed economies such as the United States and United Kingdom outsource industry products from emerging economies, such as China, to reduce costs. If the global economic recovery continues it will increase demand on the manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. 

&#160;

The industry is highly fragmented. No single company is expected to make up more than 1.0% of revenue in 2015. The market share concentration in the global handbag and purse manufacturing industry increased slightly in recent years due to mergers and consolidation among industry participants. The very high labor intensity of most of the industry's production lends itself toward many small operations. 

&#160;

There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and wholesale sale companies in our industry. We hope to offer the latest styles and the highest quality handbags to our customers, at the lowest price, so we can succeed in the business. By us ordering directly from multiple suppliers in China, we believe we can offer our customers the best possible prices for the similar or better quality products.

&#160;

We have entered into a supply agreement with Beyond Bags &#38; Cases Co., LTD, Guangzhou Xinde Leather Goods Factory and Guangzhou Xishang Co., Ltd. of China. The material terms of the supply agreement are that we must pay 30% for the purchase of Ladies Fashion Handbag goods before shipment, which is initially planned to be in the United States. Until such time as we accept delivery of the products, all risk of loss of the Ladies Fashion Handbags is on the supplying seller. We, or our customers if the product is shipped directly to the customer, have the right to inspect the goods on arrival and have 3 days to notify the supplying seller of any claim for damages with respect to the condition, grade or quality of the Ladies Fashion Handbag products. We transmit any orders received to our supplier for shipment. Our customers are responsible to cover the shipping costs, whether direct shipped to them or to us. Shipping costs are automatically added to a customer&#8217;s final bill.

&#160;

Some of our suppliers have product representatives and/or pick up locations in the U.S. In the event that the product representative or location is in an area where we have independent salespeople, the products will be picked up by our independent salesperson from supplier locations in the U.S. and delivered to our clients. The client also has the option of picking up the order from the supplier pick up locations or from us. The shipping costs to our U.S. location would be passed on to the client. 

&#160;

MARKETING 

&#160;

We believe that the best way to market our products is through fashion trade shows. There are various fashion trade shows and exhibits that take place every year, such as Stylemax, Atlanta Apparel, Fashion Coterie, Fashion Industry Gallery (FIG) that take place every year&#8211; just to name a few. We also plan to market our products through (i) magazines, such as California Apparel News, LAX Magazine, Chiffon Magazine, Splash Magazine (ii) Internet advertising on websites, such as BagsMagazine.com, and (iii) through our website that we plan to develop as part of our 12-month plan of operation, and (iv) various social networking sites. We believe that we can establish relationships with and Ladies Fashion Handbags product distributors in the United States through these mediums of communication.

&#160; 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

There are many well-established manufacturing, distribution and wholesale sales companies in our industry. We expect to face medium to high level of resistance when we enter the market, where it will be up to our marketing efforts and negotiation skills to acquire new customers. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do and will be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we are. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 

&#160;

We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation.

&#160;

BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS 

&#160;

There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

&#160;

REORGANIZATIONS, PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS 

&#160;

There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

&#160;

COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.

&#160;

We do not believe that any existing or probable government regulation on our business, including any applicable export or import regulation or control imposed by China or the United States will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

&#160;

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS 

&#160;

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. We intend to protect our website with copyright laws. Beyond our trade name, we do not hold any other intellectual property.

&#160;

&#160;

We currently own our physical property in Latvia: our office building. Our current business address is 40 Lielais prospekts, Ventspils, LV-3601 Latvia. Our telephone number is (702) 843-0232. This location serves as our primary office for planning and implementing our business plan. Management believes the current premises arrangements are sufficient for its needs for at least the next 12 months. 

&#160;

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 

&#160;

We have no employees as of the date of this report. Our sole officer and director, Artis Jansons, is an independent contractor to the Company and currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week to company matters. Mr. Jansons will devote as much time to the operation of the Company as he determines is necessary for him to manage the affairs of the Company. As our business and operations increase, we will assess the need for full time management and administrative support personnel.

Reports to Stockholders 

&#160;

We are required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. You may obtain copies of these reports from the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. or on the SEC&#8217;s website, at www.sec.gov. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

&#160;

We will also make these reports available on our website once our website is completed and launched.

&#160;

Jobs Act 

&#160;

Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (&#8220;JOBS&#8221;) Act.

&#160;

We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:

&#160;

1. on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;

&#160;

2. on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;

&#160;

3. on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or

&#160;

4. the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a &#8216;large accelerated filer&#8217;, as defined in section 240.12b&#8211;2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.&#8217;&#8217;

&#160;

A &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:

&#160;

1. it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer's most recently completed second fiscal quarter; 

&#160;

2. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and

&#160;

3. It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.

&#160;

As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:

&#160;

1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; 

&#160;

2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;

&#160;

3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;

&#160;

4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and 

&#160;

5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuer&#8217;s size.

&#160;

Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions .

&#160;

Smaller Reporting Company 

&#160;

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY - THE JOBS ACT 

&#160;

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

&#160;

&#183; 

A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&#38;A;

&#160;

&#183; 

Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company&#8217;s executive compensation arrangements; and

&#160;

&#183; 

No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.

&#160;

We may take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an "emerging growth company." 

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
