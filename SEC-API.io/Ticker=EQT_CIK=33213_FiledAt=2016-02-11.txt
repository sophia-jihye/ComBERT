 Item 1. &#160; &#32; Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

EQT Corporation (EQT or the Company) conducts its business through two &#32;business segments: EQT Production and EQT Midstream. EQT Production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the Appalachian Basin with 10.0 &#32;Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves across approximately 3.4 million &#32;gross acres, including approximately 630,000 &#32;gross acres in the Marcellus play, as of December 31, 2015 . EQT Midstream provides gathering, transmission and storage services for the Company&#8217;s produced gas, as well as for independent third parties across the Appalachian Basin, primarily through its ownership and control of EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) (NYSE: EQM), a publicly traded limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. 

In 2015, the Company formed EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP) (NYSE: EQGP), a Delaware limited partnership, to own the Company's partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights, in EQM. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned the entire non-economic general partner interest and 239,715,000 common units, which represented a 90.1% limited partner interest, in EQGP. As of December 31, 2015 , EQGP owned the following EQM partnership interests, which represent EQGP's only cash-generating assets: 21,811,643 &#32;EQM common units, representing a 27.6% &#32;limited partner interest in EQM; 1,443,015 &#32;EQM general partner units, representing a 1.8% &#32;general partner interest in EQM; and all of EQM's incentive distribution rights, or IDRs, which entitle EQGP to receive up to 48.0% &#32;of all incremental cash distributed in a quarter after $0.5250 &#32;has been distributed in respect of each common unit and general partner unit of EQM for that quarter. The Company is the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM. 

&#160; 

Key Events in 2015 &#32; 

&#160; 

During 2015 , EQT achieved record annual production sales volumes, including a 27% &#32;increase in total sales volumes and a 34% &#32;increase in Marcellus sales volumes. However, the average realized price to EQT Corporation for production sales volumes decreased 36% &#32;from $4.16 &#32;per Mcfe in 2014 &#32;to $2.67 &#32;per Mcfe in 2015 . EQT&#8217;s midstream business delivered record gathered volumes that were 28% &#32;higher than the previous year. During 2015 , EQM reported net income of $393.5 million , $127.0 million &#32;higher than 2014 . The increase was primarily related to higher operating income driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale by EQT and third parties. EQT and its consolidated subsidiaries also completed the following transactions and other events that were instrumental in contributing to a successful 2015 : 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

On February 17, 2015, the 17,339,718 subordinated units of EQM issued to the Company in connection with EQM's 2012 IPO converted into common units representing limited partner interests in EQM on a one-for-one basis as a result of satisfaction of the conditions for termination of the subordination period set forth in EQM's partnership agreement. 

&#8226; 

On March 10, 2015, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a contribution and sale agreement (Contribution Agreement) with EQM and EQM Gathering Opco, LLC (EQM Gathering), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQM. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on March 17, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company contributed the Northern West Virginia Marcellus gathering system to EQM Gathering in exchange for total consideration of $925.7 million, consisting of $873.2 million in cash, 511,973 EQM common units and 178,816 EQM general partner units (the NWV Gathering Transaction). EQM Gathering is consolidated by the Company as it is still controlled by the Company. On April 15, 2015, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Company transferred a preferred interest in EQT Energy Supply, LLC, which at the time was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to EQM in exchange for total consideration of $124.3 million. EQT Energy Supply, LLC generates revenue from services provided to a local distribution company. 

&#8226; 

On March 17, 2015 , EQM completed an underwritten public offering of 8,250,000 &#32;common units. On March 18, 2015 , the underwriters exercised their option to purchase 1,237,500 &#32;additional common units on the same terms as the offering. EQM received net proceeds of $696.6 million &#32;from the offering after deducting the underwriters&#8217; discount and offering expenses of $24.5 million . EQM used the proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the NWV Gathering Transaction. 

&#8226; 

On March 30, 2015, the Company assigned 100% of the membership interests in MVP Holdco, LLC (MVP Holdco), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that as of February 11, 2016 &#32;owned a 45.5% &#32;interest (the MVP Interest) in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP Joint Venture), to EQM for $54.2 million , which represented EQM's reimbursement to the Company for 100% of the capital contributions made by the Company to the MVP Joint Venture as of March 30, 2015. The MVP Joint Venture plans to construct the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), an estimated 300 -mile natural gas interstate pipeline spanning from northern West Virginia to southern Virginia. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 &#32;Bcf per day of 20 -year firm capacity commitments, including a 1.29 &#32;Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by the Company. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP certificate application to the FERC in October 2015 and anticipates receiving the certificate in the fourth quarter of 2016. Subject to FERC approval, construction is scheduled to begin shortly thereafter and the pipeline is expected to be in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. 

&#8226; 

On May 15, 2015, EQGP completed an IPO of 26,450,000 common units, which represented 9.9% of EQGP's outstanding limited partner interests. EQT Gathering Holdings, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as the selling unitholder, sold all of the EQGP common units in the offering, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $674.0 million after deducting the underwriters' discount of approximately $37.5 million and structuring fees of approximately $2.7 million. 

&#8226; 

During the second half of 2015 , EQM entered into an equity distribution agreement that established an "At the Market" (ATM) common unit offering program, pursuant to which a group of managers, acting as EQM's sales agents, may sell EQM common units having an aggregate offering price of up to $750 million &#32;(the $750 million ATM Program). EQM issued 1,162,475 &#32;common units at an average price per unit of $74.92 &#32;during the six months ended December 31, 2015 . EQM received net proceeds of approximately $85.5 million &#32;after deducting commissions of approximately $0.9 million &#32;and other offering expenses of approximately $0.7 million . EQM used the net proceeds from the sales for general partnership purposes. 

&#8226; 

On November 16, 2015, EQM completed an underwritten public offering of 5,650,000 &#32;common units. EQM received net proceeds of $399.9 million &#32;from the offering after deducting the underwriters&#8217; discount and offering expenses of $5.7 million . EQM will use the net proceeds from the offering for general partnership purposes, including to fund a portion of EQM's anticipated 2016 capital expenditures related to transmission and gathering expansion projects and to repay amounts outstanding under EQM's credit facility. 

EQT Production Business Segment 

&#160; 

EQT Production is one of the largest natural gas producers in the Appalachian Basin with 10.0 &#32;Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves across approximately 3.4 million &#32;gross acres, including approximately 630,000 &#32;gross acres in the Marcellus play, as of December 31, 2015 . EQT believes that it is a technology leader in extended lateral horizontal and completion drilling in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology. EQT Production&#8217;s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves. EQT&#8217;s proved reserves decreased 7% &#32;in 2015 , primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices. The Company&#8217;s Marcellus assets constitute approximately 7.8 &#32;Tcfe of the Company's total proved reserves. 

The following illustration depicts EQT&#8217;s acreage position within the Marcellus play as of December 31, 2015: 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company&#8217;s proved reserves were as follows:

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s natural gas wells are generally low-risk, having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis. Assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2015 , the remaining reserve life of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves, as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by calendar year 2015 &#32;produced volumes, is 16 &#32;years. 

The Company invested approximately $1,670 million &#32;on well development during 2015 , with total production sales volumes hitting a record high of 603.1 &#32;Bcfe, an increase of 27% &#32;over the previous year. Capital spending for EQT Production is expected to be approximately $820 million &#32;in 2016 &#32;(excluding business development and land acquisitions), the majority of which will be used to support the drilling of approximately 77 &#32;gross wells, including 72 &#32;Marcellus wells and 5 &#32;deep Utica wells. During the past three years, the Company&#8217;s number of wells drilled (spud) and related capital expenditures for well development were:

EQT Midstream Business Segment 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the current footprint of its midstream assets, which are primarily owned by EQM and span a wide area of the Marcellus and Utica Shales in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, is a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the Company for growth. EQT Midstream is strategically positioned to capitalize on the increasing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in the region, such as the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. 

In January 2012, the Company formed EQM, a publicly traded limited partnership, to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQM provides midstream services to the Company and third parties through its two &#32;primary assets: EQM&#8217;s transmission and storage system and EQM&#8217;s gathering system. 

Due to the Company's ownership and control of EQGP and EQM, the results of EQGP and EQM are both consolidated in the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, discussions of EQT Midstream&#8217;s business, operations and results in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include EQGP's and EQM&#8217;s business, operations and results. The Company records the noncontrolling interests of the public limited partners of EQGP and EQM in its financial statements. 

&#160; 

EQT Midstream&#8217;s gathering system includes approximately 8,250 &#32;miles of gathering lines, including 1,500 &#32;miles of FERC-regulated, low pressure gathering lines owned by EQM and 185 miles of high pressure gathering lines not subject to federal rate regulation owned by EQM. The left-hand map on page 12 depicts the Company&#8217;s gathering lines and compressor stations in relationship to the Marcellus Shale formation. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's Marcellus gathering capacity was approximately 2,000 &#32;MMcf per day, consisting of approximately 1,405 &#32;MMcf per day in Pennsylvania and approximately 595 &#32;MMcf per day in West Virginia. 

EQT Midstream&#8217;s transmission and storage system includes approximately 900 &#32;miles of FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that connects to seven &#32;interstate pipelines and multiple distribution companies. The interstate pipeline system includes approximately 700 &#32;miles of pipe owned by Equitrans, L.P. (Equitrans), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQM. EQT Midstream&#8217;s transmission and storage system also includes an approximately 200 -mile pipeline referred to as the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC), which was acquired by the Company in December 2013 in connection with the Equitable Gas Transaction (as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

&#160; 

The transmission and storage system is supported by eighteen &#32;natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 660 &#32;MMcf per day of peak delivery capability and 47 &#32;Bcf of working gas capacity. Fourteen &#32;of these reservoirs, representing approximately 400 &#32;MMcf per day of peak delivery capability and 32 &#32;Bcf of working gas capacity, are owned by EQM. The storage reservoirs are clustered in two &#32;geographic areas connected to EQM&#8217;s transmission and storage system, with ten &#32;in southwestern Pennsylvania and eight &#32;in northern West Virginia. The AVC facilities, which include four &#32;storage reservoirs, are owned by the Company and operated by EQM under a lease between EQM and an affiliate of the Company. 

&#160; 

The right-hand map on page 12 depicts the Company&#8217;s transmission lines, storage pools and compressor stations in relationship to the Marcellus Shale formation. EQT Midstream's year-end total transmission capacity was approximately 3,550 MMcf per day. EQT Midstream, primarily through EQM, began several multi-year transmission capacity expansion projects in 2015 to support the continued growth of the Marcellus and the developing deep Utica play, including the OVC which is currently under construction. EQM is also evaluating several projects that could total an additional 1.5 Bcf per day of capacity by year-end 2018. The projects may include additional compression, pipeline looping and new header pipelines. 

EQT Midstream also has a gas marketing affiliate, EQT Energy, LLC (EQT Energy), that provides optimization of capacity and storage assets through its NGL and natural gas sales to marketers, utilities and industrial customers within EQT's operational footprint. EQT Energy also provides marketing services and manages approximately 1,740,000 &#32;Dth per day of third-party contractual pipeline capacity for the benefit of EQT Production; and has committed to an additional 520,000 &#32;Dth per day of third-party contractual capacity expected to come online in future periods. EQT Energy currently leases 3.7 &#32;Bcf of storage-related assets from third parties. 

Strategy 

&#160; 

EQT&#8217;s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure, and, despite a reduced capital budget in 2015 that is reflective of the current price environment, profitably developing its undeveloped reserves, and effectively and efficiently utilizing its extensive gathering and transmission assets that are uniquely positioned across the Marcellus and Utica Shales and in close proximity to the northeastern United States markets. 

EQT believes that it is a technology leader in extended-lateral horizontal drilling and completion in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s acreage is held by production or in fee; therefore, EQT Production is able to develop its acreage in the most economical manner through the use of longer laterals and multi-well pads, as opposed to being required to drill less-economical wells in order to retain acreage. The use of multi-well pads, in conjunction with a completion technique known as reduced cluster spacing, has the additional benefit of reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the Company&#8217;s drilling operations. 

&#160; 

EQT also believes that its midstream assets are strategically located in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions &#8211; spanning a large, prolific area of southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia &#8211; providing a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the Company for continued growth. EQT Midstream, primarily through EQM, intends to capitalize on the growing need for gathering and transmission infrastructure in this region, and in particular the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In order to meet this growing need, EQM has been focusing on a number of gathering and transmission projects, including the following: 

&#8226; 

The OVC is a 37 -mile pipeline that will extend EQM's transmission and storage system from northern West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio, at which point it will interconnect with the Rockies Express Pipeline and may interconnect with other pipelines and liquidity points. The OVC will provide approximately 850 BBtu per day of transmission capacity with an aggregate compression of approximately 38,000 horsepower. The Company has entered into a 20-year precedent agreement for a total of 650 BBtu per day of firm transmission capacity on the OVC. EQM received its FERC certificate to construct and operate the OVC on December 30, 2015 and construction began in January 2016. EQM expects the OVC to be in-service by year-end 2016. 

&#8226; 

As of February 11, 2016, EQM owned a 45.5% &#32;interest in the MVP Joint Venture, which was formed to construct the MVP. The proposed pipeline is expected to be approximately 300 miles long, span from EQM's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia and be designed to transport natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions to the growing demand markets in the southeast region of the United States. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP certificate application to the FERC in October 2015 and anticipates receiving the certificate in the fourth quarter of 2016. Subject to FERC approval, construction is scheduled to begin shortly thereafter and the pipeline is expected to be in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. 

&#160; 

The ongoing efforts of EQGP and EQM are an important support mechanism for EQT&#8217;s overall business strategy. Through capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities, attracting additional third-party volumes, and pursuing accretive acquisitions from the Company, EQM is expected to grow profitably and provide an ongoing source of capital to the Company. 

See &#8220;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the Company&#8217;s capital expenditures. 

&#160; 

Markets and Customers 

&#160; 

Natural Gas Sales: &#32;The Company&#8217;s produced natural gas is sold to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located mainly in the Appalachian Basin and the Northeastern United States. The Company&#8217;s current transportation portfolio also enables the Company to reach markets along the Gulf Coast and Midwestern portions of the United States. Natural gas is a commodity and therefore the Company typically receives market-based pricing. The market price for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continues to be lower relative to the price at Henry Hub located in Louisiana (the location for pricing NYMEX natural gas futures) as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the Northeast region. In order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices, the Company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production, most of which is hedged at NYMEX natural gas prices. The Company&#8217;s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth in &#8220;Commodity Risk Management&#8221; in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;, Item 7A, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,&#8221; and in Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company is also helping to build additional demand for natural gas. In mid-2011, EQT opened a public-access natural gas fueling station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and, with the growing demand for compressed natural gas for numerous fleets throughout the region, the station underwent an expansion in 2013, adding two more dispensers. In conjunction with this project, the Company is promoting the use of natural gas with its own fleet vehicles and plans to operate 14% of its light-duty vehicle fleet, more than 175 vehicles, on natural gas by the end of 2016. In addition, all of the Company's contracted drilling rigs and completion crews utilize natural gas. 

NGL Sales: &#160; The Company sells NGLs from its own production through the EQT Production segment and from gas marketed for third parties by EQT Midstream. In its Appalachian operations, the Company contracts with MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (MarkWest), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX LP, to process natural gas in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons (propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline) from the natural gas stream, primarily from EQT Production&#8217;s produced gas. NGLs are recovered at the processing plants and transported to a fractionation plant owned by MarkWest for separation into commercial components. MarkWest markets these components for a fee. The Company also has contractual processing arrangements in its Permian Basin operations whereby the Company sells gas to third-party processors at a weighted average liquids component price. 

The following table presents the average sales price on an average per Mcfe basis to EQT Corporation for sales of produced natural gas, NGLs and oil, with and without cash settled derivatives, for the years ended December 31:

&#160; 

Natural Gas Gathering: &#160; EQT Midstream derives gathering revenues from charges to customers for use of its gathering system in the Appalachian Basin. The gathering system volumes are transported to four major interstate pipelines: Columbia Gas Transmission, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company, Dominion Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company. The gathering system also maintains interconnections with EQM&#8217;s transmission and storage system. 

&#160; 

Gathering system transportation volumes for 2015 &#32;totaled 754.3 &#32;TBtu, of which approximately 89% &#32;related to gathering for EQT Production and other affiliates. Revenues from EQT Production and other affiliates accounted for approximately 92% of 2015 &#32;gathering revenues. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas Transmission and Storage: Natural gas transmission and storage operations are executed using transmission and underground storage facilities owned by the Company. Customers of EQT Midstream&#8217;s gas transmission and storage services are affiliates and third parties primarily in the northeastern United States. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining contract life based on total projected contracted revenues for EQM&#8217;s firm transmission and storage contracts, including contracts on the AVC and contracts associated with expected future capacity from EQM expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which EQM has entered into firm agreements, was approximately 17 years. In 2015 , approximately 61% of transportation volumes and 53% of transmission revenues were from affiliates. 

&#160; 

Natural Gas Marketing: &#32;&#32;EQT Energy provides marketing services and third-party contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of EQT Production. EQT Energy also engages in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of EQT Production, the objective of which is to limit the Company&#8217;s exposure to shifts in market prices. EQT Energy leases third-party storage capacity in order to take advantage of seasonal spreads, where available, through the EQT Midstream segment. 

One &#32;customer within the EQT Production segment accounted for approximately 10% , 12% &#32;and 11% &#32;of EQT Production&#8217;s total operating revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The Company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the Company&#8217;s natural gas are available. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production, transportation and sale of natural gas and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct operations. Competitors include independent oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators. Competition for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates and other commercial terms, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies. Key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines. Key competitors for gathering systems include independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. EQT competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and NGLs. Some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users. 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Company&#8217;s Operations 

&#160; 

EQT Production&#8217;s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations related to the location of wells; the method of drilling, well construction, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing and casing design; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations; surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes; and the gathering of production in certain circumstances. These regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing the Company&#8217;s natural gas resources. 

&#160; 

EQT Production&#8217;s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units; setbacks; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells; drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures; and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties. Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and, for Utica or other deep wells, West Virginia allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate development and exploration. In West Virginia, the Company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for Marcellus and Upper Devonian acreage. In 2013, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation, which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases, and Texas permits similar joint development. In addition, state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and Texas sets production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well. 

&#160; 

EQT Midstream&#8217;s transmission and gathering operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances, including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements; erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects; waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations; various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices; compliance with safety regulations; and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities. These regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of, and the time to develop, new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations. 

&#160; 

The interstate natural gas transmission systems and storage operations of EQT Midstream are regulated by the FERC, and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the FERC. For instance, the FERC approves tariffs that establish EQM&#8217;s rates, cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service to EQM&#8217;s customers. The fees or rates established under EQM&#8217;s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers, including a reasonable return on invested capital. The FERC&#8217;s authority over transmission operations also extends to: storage and related services; certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities; extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities; maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates; terms and conditions of service; depreciation and amortization policies; acquisition and disposition of facilities; the safety of pipelines; and initiation and discontinuation of services. 

In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivative market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), required the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. As of the filing date of this Annual Report, the CFTC had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including the Company, such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations. Other CFTC rules that may be 

relevant to the Company have yet to be finalized. Because significant CFTC rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities are still at the proposal stage, it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the Company&#8217;s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations. The Company has experienced increased, and expects additional, compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment. 

&#160; 

Regulators periodically review or audit the Company&#8217;s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The Company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the U.S. Congress, the states, regulatory agencies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the Company. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 

&#160; 

The business operations of the Company are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the release, emission or discharge of materials into the environment; the generation, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of materials (including solid and hazardous wastes); the safety of employees and the general public; pollution; site remediation; and preservation or protection of human health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. The Company must take into account environmental, health and safety regulations in, among other things, planning, designing, constructing (including drilling), operating and abandoning wells, pipelines and related facilities. 

&#160; 

The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material to the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

&#160; 

Vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations. It is customary in the Company&#8217;s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in formations underground where water, sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation. These deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers. The Company&#8217;s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers. To assess water sources near our drilling locations, the Company conducts baseline and, as appropriate, post-drilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2,500 feet of our drilling pads. Legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing. If passed into law, the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain permits to construct wells. 

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters. 

&#160; 

Climate Change 

&#160; 

Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the Company&#8217;s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or purchase emission allowances. Climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities, or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements. Conversely, legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the Company by increasing demand for natural gas, because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per Btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels, such as coal. The effect on the Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.
