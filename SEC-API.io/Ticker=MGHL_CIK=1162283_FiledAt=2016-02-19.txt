 Item 1. Business. 

Morgan Group Holding Co. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Holding&#148;) was incorporated in November 2001 to serve, among other business purposes, as a holding company for LICT Corporation&#146;s (&#147;LICT&#148;) controlling interest in The Morgan Group, Inc. (&#147;Morgan&#148;). On January 24, 2002, LICT spun off all but 235,294 of its shares in the Company to its stockholders. 

On October 18, 2002, Morgan and two of its operating subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Indiana, South Bend Division. On March 31, 2008, the bankruptcy proceeding was concluded and the bankruptcy court dismissed the proceeding. There was no appeal from the bankruptcy court&#146;s dismissal of the proceeding, and that proceeding is now entirely ended. Morgan received no value for its equity ownership from the bankruptcy proceeding. 

Effective November 1, 2012, Jonathan P. Evans was appointed as the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mario J. Gabelli, who remains Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

We are continuing to evaluate all options available to the Company at this time. Under Mr. Evans, the Company is looking to implement a growth strategy by acquiring businesses based in the United States of an appropriate type and size. The execution of such a strategy will require the Company to obtain significantly more financial resources than it currently possesses. Those resources could take the form of a debt and/or equity offering, or potentially a hybrid instrument. There is no assurance that the Company can obtain adequate financial resources to successfully implement this strategy. 

At present, we have one full time employee.
