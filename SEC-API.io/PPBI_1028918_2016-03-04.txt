Overview 

&#160; 

We are a California-based bank holding company incorporated in 1997 in the State of Delaware and a registered banking holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Premier Bank, is a California state-chartered commercial bank. The Bank was founded in 1983 as a state-chartered thrift and subsequently converted to a federally chartered thrift in 1991. The Bank converted to a California-chartered commercial bank and became a Federal Reserve member in March of 2007. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;), which is a member bank of the FHLB System. The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to the maximum amount currently allowable under federal law. The Bank is currently subject to examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), the California Department of Business Oversight (&#8220;DBO&#8221;) and the FDIC. 

&#160; 

We are a growth company keenly focused on building shareholder value through consistent earnings and creating franchise value. Our growth is derived both organically and through acquisitions of financial institutions and lines of business that complement our business banking strategy. The Bank&#8217;s primary target market is small and middle market businesses. 

&#160; 

We primarily conduct business throughout California from our 16 full-service depository branches in the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego. These depository branches are located in the cities of Corona, Encinitas, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach, Palm Desert, Palm Springs, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Seal Beach and Tustin, California. Our corporate headquarters are located in Irvine, California. 

&#160; 

We provide banking services within our targeted markets in California to businesses, including the owners and employees of those businesses, professionals, real estate investors and non-profit organizations. Additionally, we provide certain banking services nationwide. We provide customized cash management, electronic banking services and credit facilities to Home Owners&#8217; Associations (&#8220;HOA&#8221;) and HOA management companies nationwide. We provide U.S. Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans nationwide, which provide entrepreneurs and small business owners access to loans needed for working capital and continued growth. In addition, we expanded our commercial banking platform as a result of our acquisition of Infinity Franchise Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Infinity Holdings&#8221;) and its primary operating subsidiary, Infinity Franchise Capital (&#8220;IFC&#8221; and together with Infinity Holdings, &#8220;Infinity&#8221;), in January 2014. Infinity was a specialty, nationwide lender to franchisees in the quick service restaurant (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) industry. Following the acquisition of Infinity Holdings, we began offering loans and other services to franchisees in the QSR industry. 

&#160; 

Through our branches and our Internet website at www.ppbi.com, we offer a broad array of deposit products and services, including checking, money market and savings accounts, cash management services, 

electronic banking services, and on-line bill payment. We also offer a wide array of loan products, such as commercial business loans, lines of credit, SBA loans, warehouse credit facilities, commercial real estate loans, residential home loans, construction loans and consumer loans. At December 31, 2015 , we had consolidated total assets of $2.8 billion , net loans of $ 2.2 billion , total deposits of $ 2.2 billion , and consolidated total stockholders&#8217; equity of $ 299 million . At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was considered a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; financial institution for regulatory capital purposes. 

&#160; 

The Corporation's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &#8220;PPBI.&#8221; There are 50.0 million authorized shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock, with approximately 21.6 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , which increased to approximately 27.4 million upon the closing of the acquisition of Security California Bancorp ("SCAF") in January of 2016, as described below under &#8220;Recent Developments.&#8221; The Corporation has an additional 1.0 million authorized shares of preferred stock, none of which have been issued to date.

&#160; 

Recent Developments - Acquisition of Security California Bancorp 

On October 2, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire SCAF, the holding company of Security Bank of California ("Security"), a Riverside, California, based state-chartered bank with six &#32;branches located in Riverside County, San Bernardino County and Orange County. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2016, whereby we acquired $715 million &#32;in total assets, $467 million &#32;in loans and $635 million &#32;in total deposits. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of SCAF common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.9629 &#32;shares of Company common stock. The value of the total deal consideration was approximately $120 million , which includes $788.1 &#32;thousand of aggregate cash consideration to the holders of SCAF stock options (based on the excess of $18.75 per share over the average exercise price of $15.58 per share for 248,459 options). 

&#160; 

Our Strategic Plan 

&#160; 

Our strategic plan is focused on generating organic growth through our high performing sales culture. Additionally, we seek to grow through mergers and acquisitions of California based banks and the acquisition of lines of business that complement our business banking strategy. 

&#160; 

Our two key operating strategies are summarized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Expansion through Organic Growth. Over the past several years, we have developed a high performing sales culture that places a premium on business bankers that have the ability to consistently generate new business. Business unit managers that possess in-depth product knowledge and expertise in their respective lines of business systematically manage the business development efforts through the use of sales and relationship management technology tools. 

&#8226; 

Expansion through Acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is twofold; first we seek to acquire whole banks within the State of California to expand geographically and/or to consolidate in our existing markets, and second we seek to acquire lines of business that will complement our existing business banking strategy. We have completed seven acquisitions since 2010: Canyon National Bank (&#8220;CNB&#8221;) (FDIC-assisted, geographic expansion, closed February 2011), Palm Desert National Bank (&#8220;PDNB&#8221;) (FDIC-assisted, in market consolidation, closed April 2012), First Associations Bank 

(&#8220;FAB&#8221;) (open bank, nationwide HOA line of business, closed March 2013), San Diego Trust Bank (&#8220;SDTB&#8221;) (open bank, geographic expansion, closed June 2013), Infinity (nationwide lender to franchisees in the QSR industry, closed January 2014), Independence Bank ("IDPK") (open bank, geographic expansion, closed January 2015), and SCAF (open bank, geographic expansion, closed January 2016). We will continue to pursue acquisitions of open banks and other non-depository businesses that meet our criteria, though there can be no assurances that we will identify or consummate any such acquisitions, and if we do, that any or all of those acquisitions will produce the intended results. 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

General. &#160; In 2015 , we maintained our commitment to a high level of credit quality in our lending activities. Our core lending business continues to focus on meeting the financial needs of local businesses and their owners. To that end, the Company offers a full complement of flexible and structured loan products tailored to meet the diverse needs of our customers. 

&#160; 

During 2015 , we made or purchased loans to borrowers secured by real property and business assets located principally in California, our primary market area. We made select loans, primarily QSR franchise loans, SBA guaranteed loans and loans to HOAs, throughout the United States. We emphasize relationship lending and focus on generating loans with customers who also maintain full depository relationships with us. These efforts assist us in establishing and expanding depository relationships consistent with the Company&#8217;s strategic direction. We maintain an internal lending limit below our $ 94.1 million &#32;legal lending limit for secured loans and $ 56.5 million &#32;for unsecured loans as of December 31, 2015 . Historically, we have managed loan concentrations by selling certain loans, primarily commercial non-owner occupied CRE and multi-family residential loan production. In recent periods we have also focused on selling the guaranteed portion of SBA loans due to the attractive premiums in the market which gains on sale increase our noninterest income. Other types of loan sales remain a strategic option for us. 

&#160; 

During 2015 , we originated $ 124 million &#32;of commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loans, $ 171 million &#32;of QSR franchise loans, $ 250 million &#32;of construction loans, $ 62.0 million &#32;of non-owner occupied CRE loans, $ 113 million &#32;of SBA loans, $ 94.4 million &#32;of multi-family real estate loans, $ 48.6 million &#32;of owner occupied CRE loans, $ 93.4 million &#32;of warehouse facilities, and $ 20.8 million &#32;of single family real estate loans and other loans; and we purchased $ 376 million &#32;of loans including $ 333 million &#32;acquired from Independence Bank. At December 31, 2015 , we had $ 2.26 billion &#32;in total gross loans outstanding. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Industrial Lending. &#160; We originate C&#38;I loans secured by business assets including inventory, receivables, and machinery and equipment to businesses located in our primary market area. Loan types include revolving lines of credit, term loans, seasonal loans and loans secured by liquid collateral such as cash deposits or marketable securities. HOA credit facilities are included in C&#38;I loans. We also issue letters of credit on behalf of our customers, backed by loans or deposits with the Company. At December 31, 2015 , C&#38;I loans totaled $ 310 million , constituting 13.7% &#32;of our gross loans. At December 31, 2015 , we had commitments to extend additional credit on C&#38;I loans of $ 200 million . 

Franchise Lending. We originate C&#38;I loans to franchises in the QSR industry nationwide including financing for equipment, real estate, new store development, remodeling, refinancing, acquisition and partnership restructuring. At December 31, 2015 , Franchise loans totaled $329 million , constituting 14.5% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

Commercial Owner-Occupied Business Lending. &#160; We originate and purchase loans secured by owner-occupied CRE, such as small office and light industrial buildings, and mixed-use commercial properties located predominantly in California. We also make loans secured by special purpose properties, such as gas stations and churches. Pursuant to our underwriting policies, owner-occupied CRE loans may be made in amounts of up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the collateral property. Loans are generally made for 

terms up to 25 years with amortization periods up to 25 years. At December 31, 2015 , we had $295 million &#32;of owner-occupied CRE secured loans, constituting 13.0% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

SBA Lending. &#160; We are approved to originate loans under the SBA&#8217;s Preferred Lenders Program (&#8220;PLP&#8221;). The PLP lending status affords us a higher level of delegated credit autonomy, translating to a significantly shorter turnaround time from application to funding, which is critical to our marketing efforts. We originate loans nationwide under the SBA&#8217;s 7(a), Express, Patriot Express, International Trade and 504 loan programs, in conformity with SBA underwriting and documentation standards. The guaranteed portion of the 7(a) loans is typically sold on the secondary market. At December 31, 2015 , we had $62.3 million &#32;of SBA loans, constituting 2.8% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

Warehouse Repurchase Facilities. We provide warehouse repurchase facilities for qualified mortgage bankers operating principally in California. These facilities provide short-term funding for one-to-four family mortgage loans via a mechanism whereby the mortgage banker sells us closed loans on an interim basis, to be repurchased in conjunction with the sale of each loan on the secondary market. We carefully underwrite and monitor the financial strength and performance of all counterparties to the transactions, including the mortgage bankers, secondary market participants and closing agents. We generally purchase only conforming/conventional (Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;FNMA&#8221;), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;FHLMC&#8221;)) and government guaranteed (Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;), Veterans Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;)) credits, and only after thorough due diligence including sophisticated fraud checks. At December 31, 2015 , warehouse loans totaled $143 million , constituting 6.3% &#32;of our gross loans. We have notified our borrowers that we will no longer provide funding under the repurchase facilities after March 15, 2016 and will be winding down and exiting the warehouse lending area. 

&#160; 

Commercial Non-Owner Occupied Real Estate Lending. &#160; We originate and purchase loans that are secured by CRE, such as retail centers, small office and light industrial buildings, and mixed-use commercial properties that are not occupied by the borrower and are located predominantly in California. We also make loans secured by special purpose properties, such as hotels and self-storage facilities. Pursuant to our underwriting practices, non-owner occupied CRE loans may be made in amounts up to 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the collateral property. We consider the net operating income of the property and typically require a stabilized debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.20:1, based on the qualifying loan interest rate. Loans are generally made for terms from 10 years up to 25 years with amortization periods up to 25 years. At December 31, 2015 , we had $422 million &#32;of non-owner occupied CRE secured loans, constituting 18.7% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

Multi-family Residential Lending . We originate and purchase loans secured by multi-family residential properties (five units and greater) located predominantly in California. Pursuant to our underwriting practices, multi-family residential loans may be made in an amount up to 75% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the collateral property. In addition, we generally require a stabilized minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.15:1, based on the qualifying loan interest rate. Loans are made for terms of up to 30 years with amortization periods up to 30 years. At December 31, 2015 , we had $429 million &#32;of multi-family real estate secured loans, constituting 19.0% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

One-to-Four Family Real Estate Lending. &#160; Although we do not originate first lien single family mortgages, we occasionally purchase such loans to diversify our portfolio. Our portfolio of one-to-four family loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;totaled $80.1 million , constituting 3.5% &#32;of our gross loans, of which $71.7 million &#32;consists of loans secured by first liens on real estate and $8.4 million &#32;consists of loans secured by second or junior liens on real estate. 

&#160; 

Construction Lending . We originate loans for the construction of 1-4 family and multi-family residences and CRE properties in our market area. We concentrate our efforts on single homes and very small infill projects in established neighborhoods where there is not abundant land available for development. Pursuant to our underwriting practices, construction loans may be made in an amount up to the lesser of 80% of the completed 

value of or 85% of the cost to build the collateral property. Loans are made solely for the term of construction, generally less than 24 months. We require that the owner&#8217;s equity is injected prior to the funding of the loan. At December 31, 2015 , construction loans totaled $170 million , constituting 7.5% &#32;of our gross loans, and had commitments to extend additional construction credit of $155 million . 

&#160; 

Land Loans. We occasionally originate land loans located predominantly in California for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate construction of a home or commercial building. We do not originate loans to facilitate the holding of land for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2015 , land loans totaled $18.3 million , constituting 0.8% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; 

Other Loans. &#160; We originate a limited number of consumer loans, generally for banking customers only, which consist primarily of home equity lines of credit, savings account secured loans and auto loans. Before we make a consumer loan, we assess the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and, if applicable, the value of the collateral securing the loan. At December 31, 2015 , we had $5.1 million &#32;in other loans that represented 0.2% &#32;of our gross loans. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General. Deposits, loan repayments and prepayments, and cash flows generated from operations and borrowings are the primary sources of the Company&#8217;s funds for use in lending, investing and other general purposes. 

&#160; 

Deposits. Deposits represent our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The deposit accounts are offered through our 16 branch network in California and nationwide through our HOA Banking unit. The Company&#8217;s deposits consist of checking accounts, money market accounts, passbook savings, and certificates of deposit. Total deposits at December 31, 2015 &#32;were $2.2 billion , compared to $1.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2015 , certificates of deposit constituted 23.7% &#32;of total deposits, compared to 27.1% &#32;at the year-end 2014 . The terms of the fixed-rate certificates of deposit offered by the Company vary from three months to five years. Specific terms of an individual account vary according to the type of account, the minimum balance required, the time period funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. At December 31, 2015 , we had $400 million &#32;of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in one year or less. 

&#160; 

We primarily rely on customer service, sales and marketing efforts, business development, cross-selling of deposit products to loan customers, and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain local deposits. However, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain deposits. Additionally, from time to time, we will utilize both wholesale and brokered deposits to supplement our generation of deposits from businesses and consumers. At December 31, 2015 , we had $155 million &#32;in brokered deposits that were raised to help lengthen the overall maturity of our liabilities and support our interest rate risk management strategies. The brokered deposits had a weighted average maturity of 15 months &#32;and an all in cost of 66 basis points . 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2014, we had two operating subsidiaries, the Bank, a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary with no subsidiaries of its own, and PPBI Trust I, which is a wholly-owned special purpose entity accounted for using the equity method under which the subsidiaries&#8217; net earnings are recognized in our operations and the investment in the Trust is included in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition. 

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 332 full-time employees and three part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We consider our Bank to be a community bank focused on the commercial banking business, with our primary market encompassing California. To a lesser extent, we also compete in several broader regional and national markets through our HOA Banking, SBA, Warehouse Lending, Franchise Lending and Income Property business units. 

&#160; 

The banking business is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services. The industry continues to consolidate, and unregulated competitors in the banking markets have focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments. Many largely unregulated competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries, and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to nearly all significant banking services and products. 

&#160; 

The banking business is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographical area. These banks have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand. Many of the major banks operating in our primary market area offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions. By virtue of their greater total capitalization, the major banks also have substantially higher lending limits than those we do. 

&#160; 

In addition to other local community banks, our competitors include commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions, such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms and investment banking firms. Increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal financial software. Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products, as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers. Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. 

&#160; 

Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in the financial services market. Such innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products. In addition, many customers now expect a choice of delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mobile phones, mail, home computer, ATMs, self-service branches, and/or in-store branches. The sources of competition in such products include commercial banks, as well as credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, internet-only financial intermediaries and mortgage banking firms. 

&#160; 

We work to anticipate and adapt to competitive conditions whether it is by developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, or providing highly personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, &#32; no assurances can be given that our efforts to compete in our market areas will continue to be successful. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

General . Bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, and banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by federal and state regulators. Various requirements and restrictions under state and federal law affect our operations, including reserves against deposits, ownership of deposit accounts, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices and capital requirements. The following is a summary of certain statutes and rules applicable to us. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute and regulatory provision referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all applicable statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly and annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve may conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. The Corporation is also a bank holding company within the meaning of the California Financial Code (the &#8220;Financial Code&#8221;). As such, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. 

&#160; 

Under changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. In order to fulfill its obligations as a source of strength, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. In addition, the Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve&#8217;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

As a California state-chartered commercial bank, which is a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is subject to supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Reserve. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased to $250,000 per depositor for all insured depository institutions. As a result of this deposit insurance function, the FDIC also has certain supervisory authority and powers over the Bank as well as all other FDIC insured institutions. If, as a result of an examination of the Bank, the regulators should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or our management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the regulators. Such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict growth, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors and ultimately to request the FDIC to terminate the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. As a California-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is also subject to certain provisions of California law. 

&#160; 

Legislative and regulatory initiatives have been, and are likely to continue to be, introduced and implemented, which could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or new regulations will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that new legislation or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies would have on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies can be more aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, which could result in an increased issuance of enforcement actions to financial institutions requiring action to address credit quality, liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy, as well as other safety and soundness concerns. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts, and increased the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, and their non-bank subsidiaries. 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate. 

&#160; 

Activities of Bank Holding Companies . The activities of bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that qualify and register as &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; are also able to engage in certain additional financial activities, such as merchant banking and securities and insurance underwriting, subject to limitations set forth in federal law. We are not at this date a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The BHCA requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) taking any action that causes a bank to become a controlled subsidiary of the bank holding company; (ii) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any bank or bank holding company, if the acquisition results in the acquiring bank holding company having control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of such bank or bank holding company, unless such bank or bank holding company is majority-owned by the acquiring bank holding company before the acquisition; (iii) acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; or (iv) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Permissible Activities of the Bank . Because California permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, the Bank can form subsidiaries to engage in activates &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities and expanded financial activities. However, to form a financial subsidiary, the Bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks. Generally, a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or incidental thereto, even though they are not permissible for the national bank to conduct directly within the bank. The definition of &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; includes, among other items, underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities, including, for example, distributing shares of mutual funds. The subsidiary may not, however, engage as principal in underwriting insurance (other than credit life insurance), issue annuities or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking. 

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation. &#160; Federal banking agencies have issued guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions (generally institutions that have over $1 billion in assets) and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal agencies. These agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a banking organization previously has received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve must apply consolidated capital requirements to depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally requires capital requirements to be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. 

Under federal regulations, bank holding companies and banks must meet certain risk-based capital requirements. Prior to the effectiveness of Basel III, on January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital requirements were as follows: a minimum ratio of 8% of total capital to risk-weighted assets, and a minimum ratio of 4% of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Under federal regulations in effect prior to the effectiveness of Basel III, &#8220;Tier 1 capital&#8221; is defined to include: common stockholders&#8217; equity (including retained earnings), qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (limited to a maximum of 25% of Tier 1 capital), and certain trust preferred securities. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, federal banking regulators required banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. For a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations, the minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 3%. For all banking organizations not rated in the highest category, the minimum leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable federal regulations, banks must have a minimum leverage ratio of 5%. 

Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Basel III final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduces as a new capital measure &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. When fully phased-in by January 1, 2019, Basel III requires banks will be subject to the following risk-based capital requirements: 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.5%; 

&#8226; 

a minimum ratio of Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 10.5%; and 

&#8226; 

a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

The Basel III final framework provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Basel III also includes, as part of the definition of CET1 capital, a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of Additional Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;, which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are not required to be treated as other-than-temporary impairment, net of tax) in calculating regulatory capital. Banking institutions had the option to opt out of including AOCI in CET1 capital if they elected to do in their first regulatory report following January 1, 2015. As permitted by Basel III, the Company and the Bank have elected to exclude AOCI from CET1. 

Basel III also includes the following significant provisions: 

&#8226; 

An additional countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed by applicable national banking regulators periodically at their discretion, with advance notice, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% and 2.5% when fully implemented; 

&#8226; 

Restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses applicable when capital ratios fall within the buffer zone; 

&#8226; 

Deduction from common equity of deferred tax assets that depend on future profitability to be realized; and 

&#8226; 

For capital instruments issued on or after January 13, 2013 (other than common equity), a loss-absorbency requirement that the instrument must be written off or converted to common equity if a triggering event occurs, either pursuant to applicable law or at the direction of the banking regulator. A triggering event is an event that would cause the banking organization to become nonviable without the write off or conversion, or without an injection of capital from the public sector. 

Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on its ability to pay dividends, effect equity repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The Dodd-Frank Act excludes trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, from being included in Tier 1 capital, unless the issuing company is a bank holding company with less than $500 million in total assets. Trust preferred securities issued prior to that date will continue to count as Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, such as the Corporation. The trust preferred securities issued by our unconsolidated subsidiary capital trust qualify as Tier 1 capital up to a maximum limit of 25% of total Tier 1 capital. Any additional portion of our trust preferred securities would qualify as &#8220;Tier 2 capital.&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, the subsidiary trust had $10.3 million in trust preferred securities outstanding, of which $10.0 million qualifies as Tier 1 capital and $60 million in subordinated notes that qualifies as Tier 2 capital. Also, goodwill and most intangible assets are deducted from Tier 1 capital. For purposes of applicable the total risk-based capital regulatory guidelines, Tier 2 capital (sometimes referred to as &#8220;supplementary capital&#8221;) is defined to include, subject to limitations: perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, intermediate-term preferred stock and any related surplus, certain hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, allowances for loan and lease losses, and intermediate-term subordinated debt instruments. The maximum amount of qualifying Tier 2 capital is 100% of qualifying Tier 1 capital. For purposes of determining total capital under federal guidelines, total capital equals Tier 1 capital, plus qualifying Tier 2 capital, minus investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, reciprocal holdings of bank holding company capital securities, and deferred tax assets and other deductions. 

Basel III changes the manner of calculating risk weighted assets. New methodologies for determining risk weighted assets in the general capital rules are included, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, including a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors. They also include risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components. In particular, loans categorized as &#8220;high-volatility commercial real estate&#8221; loans (&#8220;HVCRE loans&#8221;) are required to be assigned a 150% risk weighting, and require additional capital support. HVCRE loans are defined to include any credit facility that finances or has financed the acquisition, development or construction of real property, unless it finances: 1-4 family residential properties; certain community development investments; agricultural land used or usable for, and whose value is based on, agricultural use; or commercial real estate projects in which: (i) the loan to value is less than the applicable maximum supervisory loan to value ratio established by the bank regulatory agencies; (ii) the borrower has contributed cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets, or has paid development expenses out of pocket, equal to at least 15% of the appraised &#8220;as completed&#8221; value; (iii) the borrower contributes its 15% before the bank advances any funds; and (iv) the capital contributed by the borrower, and any funds internally generated by the project, is contractually required to remain in the project until the facility is converted to permanent financing, sold or paid in full. 

In addition to the uniform risk-based capital guidelines and regulatory capital ratios that apply across the industry, the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios. Future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy. Such a change could affect our ability to grow and could restrict the amount of profits, if any, available for the payment of dividends. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to adopt capital requirements that address the risks that the activities of an institution poses to the institution and the public and private stakeholders, including risks arising from certain enumerated activities. The federal banking agencies will likely change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act or other regulatory or supervisory changes. We will be assessing the impact on us of these new regulations, as they are proposed and implemented. 

Basel III became applicable to the Corporation and the Bank on January 1, 2015. Overall, the Corporation believes that implementation of the Basel III Rule will not have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#8217;s or the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios, earnings, shareholder&#8217;s equity, or its ability to pay dividends, effect stock repurchases or pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. &#32;&#32;The federal banking regulators are required to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Federal banking regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Under regulations effective through December 31, 2014, the Bank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, which means it had a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and was not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

&#160; 

As noted above, Basel III integrates the new capital requirements into the prompt corrective action category definitions. As of January 1, 2015, the following capital requirements apply to the Corporation for purposes of Section 38 of the FDIA.

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; according to the guidelines as generally discussed below. As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had a consolidated ratio of 14.46% of total capital to risk-weighted assets and a consolidated ratio of 10.30% of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and the Bank had a ratio of 13.45% of total capital to risk-weighted assets and a ratio of 12.72% of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. 

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An institution&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the institution&#8217;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

In the event an institution becomes &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary&#8217;s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution&#8217;s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes &#8220;significantly&#8221; or &#8220;critically&#8221; undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, bank regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. 

As an institution&#8217;s capital decreases, the regulators&#8217; enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management, and other restrictions. A regulator has limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator. 

&#32;Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital. 

&#32;In addition to the federal regulatory capital requirements described above, the DBO has authority to take possession of the business and properties of a bank in the event that the tangible stockholders&#8217; equity of a bank is less than the greater of (i) 4% of the bank&#8217;s total assets or (ii) $1.0 million. 

&#160; 

Dividends . It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to the Corporation is subject to restrictions set forth in the Financial Code. The Financial Code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of a bank&#8217;s (1) retained earnings; or (2) net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority-owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period. However, a bank may, with the approval of the DBO, make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (a) its retained earnings; (b) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (c) its net income for its current fiscal year. In the event that bank regulators determine that the stockholders' equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound, the regulators may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Under these provisions, the amount available for distribution from the Bank to the Corporation was approximately $ 58.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Approval of the Federal Reserve is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve, such as the Bank, if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits without regulatory and stockholder approval. The Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

It is our policy to retain earnings, if any, to provide funds for use in our business. We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance of Certain Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank is an FDIC insured financial institution whereby the FDIC provides deposit insurance for a certain maximum dollar amount per customer. The Bank, as is the case with all FDIC insured banks, is subject to deposit insurance assessments as determined by the FDIC. The amount of the deposit insurance assessment for institutions with less than $10.0 billion in assets, which includes the Bank, is based on its risk category, with certain adjustments for any unsecured debt or brokered deposits held by the insured bank. Institutions assigned to higher risk categories (that is, institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to the DIF) pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. An institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based on a combination of its financial ratios and supervisory ratings, reflecting, among other things, its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that the institution poses to the regulators. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. Deposit insurance assessments fund the DIF. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act changes the way that deposit insurance premiums are calculated. The assessment base is no longer the institution&#8217;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act also increases the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits by 2020, eliminates the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year, and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository 

institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. Continued action by the FDIC to replenish the DIF, as well as the changes contained in the Dodd Frank Act, may result in higher assessment rates, which could reduce our profitability or otherwise negatively impact our operations. Based on the current FDIC insurance assessment methodology and including our participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program, our FDIC insurance premium expense was $ 1.4 million &#32;for 2015 , $ 1.0 million &#32;for 2014 &#32;and $ 749,000 &#32;in 2013 . 

&#160; 

Transactions with Related Parties. Depository institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in the Federal Reserve Act (the &#8220;FRA&#8221;) with respect to loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders. Under the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers and stockholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution&#8217;s loans-to-one-borrower limit as discussed in the above section. Federal regulations also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers, and stockholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any &#8220;interested&#8221; director may not participate in the voting. The prescribed loan amount, which includes all other outstanding loans to such person, as to which such prior board of director approval is required, is the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus up to $500,000. The Federal Reserve also requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to non-executive employees of the bank and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There are additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer. 

&#160; 

Transactions between a bank and its &#8220;affiliates&#8221; are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA. Section 23A restricts the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the financial institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the institution&#8217;s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Section 23A and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates are generally prohibited. Section 23B generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates, including loans and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. The Federal Reserve has promulgated Regulation W, which codifies prior interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and provides interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, a bank&#8217;s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. We are considered to be an affiliate of the Bank.

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the FRA, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution's board of directors.

Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) asset growth; (v) earnings; and (vi) compensation, fees and benefits. 

&#160; 

In addition, the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. These guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system 

to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an insured depository institution should (i) conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets; (ii) estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses; (iii) compare problem asset totals to capital; (iv) take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets; (v) consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations; and (vi) provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.

Loans-to-One Borrower. Under California law, our ability to make aggregate secured and unsecured loans-to-one-borrower is limited to 25% and 15%, respectively, of unimpaired capital and surplus. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s limit on aggregate secured loans-to-one-borrower was $ 94.1 million &#32;and unsecured loans-to-one borrower was $ 56.5 million . The Bank has established internal loan limits which are lower than the legal lending limits for a California bank. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws. The Bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and CRA activities. The CRA generally requires the federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and CRA into account when regulating and supervising other activities. A bank&#8217;s compliance with its CRA obligations is based on a performance-based evaluation system which bases CRA ratings on an institution&#8217;s lending service and investment performance, resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulator of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; Based on its last CRA examination, the Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating.

Bank Secrecy Act and Money Laundering Control Act. In 1970, Congress passed the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, otherwise known as the Bank Secrecy Act (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;), which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions. The BSA was designed to help identify the source, volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the U.S. in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking, terrorism and other criminal activities. The primary tool used to implement BSA requirements is the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports. Today, the BSA requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance, designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the "USA Patriot Act" or the "Patriot Act," financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The costs or other effects of the compliance burdens imposed by the Patriot Act or future anti-terrorist, homeland security or anti-money laundering legislation or regulation cannot be predicted with certainty. 

&#160; 

Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws include, among others, Truth in Lending Act; Truth in Savings Act; Electronic Funds Transfer Act; Expedited Funds Availability Act; Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; Fair Housing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act; Fair Debt 

Collection Act; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and usury laws. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general, and civil or criminal liability. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has broad authority to regulate and supervise the retail consumer financial products and services activities of banks and various non-bank providers. The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, guidance and policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions with regard to consumer financial products and services. In general, however, banks with assets of $10.0 billion or less, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for consumer compliance by their primary federal banking regulator. The creation of the CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has lead to, and is likely to continue to lead to, enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws. 

&#160; 

In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. 

&#160; 

Federal and State Taxation 

&#160; 

The Corporation and the Bank report their income on a consolidated basis using the accrual method of accounting, and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions. The Company has not been audited by the IRS. For its 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;tax years, the Company was subject to a maximum tax rate of 35.00% and California state income tax rate of 10.84%.
