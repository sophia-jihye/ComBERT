 Item 1. Business &#32; 

Overview 

Travelzoo Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Travelzoo&#8221;) is a global media commerce company. We inform over 28 million &#32;members in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America, as well as millions of website users, about the best travel, entertainment and local deals available from thousands of companies. Our deal experts source, research and test-book offers, recommending only those that meet Travelzoo's rigorous quality standards. We provide travel, entertainment, and local businesses with a fast, flexible, and cost effective way to reach millions of consumers. Our revenues are generated primarily from advertising fees. 

We attract a high-quality audience of travel and leisure enthusiasts across multiple digital platforms, including e-mail, web, social media and mobile applications. Our e-mail newsletters are published in 11 countries worldwide. Travelzoo&#8217;s website is visited by 8.4 million unique visitors each month. We reach an audience of over 60 million Internet users each month via the Travelzoo Network, a network of websites that syndicate our deal content, including The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. We have over 3.2 million followers on Facebook and Twitter. Our mobile applications have been downloaded 4.7 million times. 

Our publications and products include the Travelzoo websites (travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de, travelzoo.es, travelzoo.fr, cn.travelzoo.com, travelzoo.co.jp, travelzoo.com.au, travelzoo.com.hk, travelzoo.com.tw, among others), the Travelzoo &#32;iPhone and Android applications, the Travelzoo Top 20 e-mail newsletter, and the Newsflash e-mail alert service. We operate SuperSearch , a pay-per-click travel search tool, and the Travelzoo Network , a network of third-party websites that list deals published by Travelzoo. Our Travelzoo &#32;websites include Local Deals and &#32;Getaway &#32;listings that allow our members to purchase vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants. We receive a percentage of the face value of the voucher from the local businesses. We also operate Fly.com , a travel search engine that allows users to quickly and easily find the best prices on flights from hundreds of airlines and online travel agencies. 

On August 20, 2015 we acquired the Travelzoo Asia Pacific business (&#8220;Asia Pacific&#8221;), which includes the Travelzoo businesses in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. This business was independently operated by Azzurro Capital Inc. ("Azzurro") under a licensing agreement with Travelzoo Inc. Azzurro was the majority stockholder of the Travelzoo Asia Pacific business. Travelzoo Inc. accounted for the acquisition as a common control transaction and change in reporting entity. The financial results for Travelzoo Inc. have been retrospectively adjusted to include the financial results of Asia Pacific in the current and prior periods as though the transaction occurred at the beginning of each period presented. The Asia Pacific assets and liabilities have been combined with Travelzoo Inc. at their carrying values as though the transaction occurred at the beginning of each period presented. The Asia Pacific transaction proceeds were reflected as an equity transaction, included in retained earnings, during the period the transaction occurred, which was in the year ended December 31, 2015 . See Note 13 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition of Asia Pacific. 

More than 2,000 companies use our services, including Air New Zealand, Apple Vacations, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Expedia, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Hawaiian Airlines, InterContinental Hotels Group, Interstate Hotels &#38; Resorts, Lufthansa, Key Tours International, Liberty Travel, Princess Cruises, Singapore Airlines, Solar Tours, Starwood Hotels &#38; Resorts Worldwide, Travelocity, United Airlines, Vacation Express and Virgin America. 

Our revenues are advertising revenues, consisting primarily of listing fees paid by travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers on Travelzoo's media properties. Listing fees are based on audience reach, placement, number of listings, number of impressions, number of click-throughs, number of referrals, or percentage of the face value of vouchers sold. Insertion orders are typically for periods between one month and twelve months and are not automatically renewed. Merchant agreements for Local Deals and &#32;Getaway advertisers are typically for twelve months and are not automatically renewed. 

We have three operating segments based on geographic regions: Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. Asia Pacific consists of our operations in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Europe consists of our operations in France, Germany, Spain, and the U.K. North America consists of our operations in Canada and the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , Asia Pacific operations were 8% &#32;of revenues and European operations were 30% &#32;of revenues. Financial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Our principal business office is located at 590 Madison Avenue, 37th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 

Ralph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo and who is a Director of the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro Capital Inc. ("Azzurro"). As of December 31, 2015 , Azzurro is the Company's largest stockholder, holding approximately 51.2% &#32;of the Company's outstanding shares. 

As of December 31, 2015 , there were 14,518,655 &#32;shares of common stock outstanding. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Travelzoo is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;TZOO.&#8221; 

Our Industry 

Our mission is to provide our audience with the highest quality information about the best travel, entertainment and local deals. We believe there is a sizable travel and entertainment industry that we participate in that provides an opportunity to find high quality deals for our members and users. Direct spending on leisure travel in the United States by domestic and international travelers is expected to rise by 4.3% per year to $1,027 billion in 2025 and 78% of the domestic trips were taken for leisure purposes, according to the U.S. Travel Association. Travel &#38; Tourism produced $7.6 trillion in value (10% of global GDP) for the global economy in 2014. Visitors from emerging economies now represent a 46% share of these international arrivals (up from 38% in 2000), according to the World Travel &#38; Tourism Council. In addition, we believe that we are well positioned with our operations in Asia, Europe and North America to capture high quality deals for our members and users. 

While our mission is to provide our audience with the highest quality information about the best travel, entertainment and local deals, our revenues are generated from advertising fees. According to the Kelsey Group's (BIA/Kelsey) new U.S. Local Media Forecast 2016, BIA/Kelsey forecasts total local media revenues to reach $146.6 billion in 2016. Online/digital will grow to $42.6 billion or 29.1% of total local media revenues in 2016. We believe that traditional media outlets such as newspapers, television and radio continue to be another medium for travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers, though the percentage spent on advertising in these traditional media outlets is decreasing. In addition, the continued rise in smart phones has changed the business rules for online marketing, with the consumption of online advertising rapidly moving to mobile devices. BIA/Kelsey anticipates that location-targeted mobile advertising revenues will grow from $8.5 billion in 2015 to $11.3 billion in 2016 and local social media revenues will grow from $2.4 billion in 2015 to $3.3 billion in 2016. 

We believe that several factors are causing and will continue to cause travel, entertainment and local businesses to increase their spending on Internet and mobile advertising of offers: 

The Internet Is Consumers' Preferred Information Source. Market research shows that the Internet has become consumers' preferred information source for travel. 

Benefits of Internet Advertising vs. Print, TV and Radio Advertising. Internet advertising provides advertisers advantages compared to traditional advertising. These advantages include real-time listings, real-time updates, and performance tracking. See &#8220;Benefits to Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses&#8221; below. 

New Advertising Opportunities. The Internet allows advertisers to advertise their sales and specials in a fast, flexible, and cost-effective manner that has not been possible before. 

Suppliers Selling Directly. We believe that many travel suppliers prefer to sell directly to consumers through suppliers' websites versus selling through travel agents. Internet advertising attracts consumers to suppliers' websites. 

Mobile advertising extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. Mobile advertising is still in its early stage, though mobile devices are quickly becoming the world's newest gateway for information. We are focused on developing easy-to-use mobile applications to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our advertisers, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go. We continue to invest in improving users' access to our services through such devices. 

Problems Travel, Entertainment and Local Businesses Face and Limitations of Newspaper, TV and Radio Advertising 

We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses often face the challenge of being able to effectively and quickly market and sell their excess inventory (i.e. airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise cabins, theater seats, spa appointments or restaurant seats that are likely to be unfilled). The success of marketing excess inventory can have a substantial impact on a company's profitability. Almost all costs of these services are fixed. That is, the costs do not vary significantly with sales. A relatively small amount of unsold inventory can have a significant impact on the profitability of a company. 

We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses need a fast, flexible, and cost-effective solution for marketing excess inventory. The solution must be fast, because services are a quickly expiring commodity. The period between the time when a company realizes that there is excess inventory and the time when the service has become worthless is very short. The solution must be flexible, because the demand for excess inventory is difficult to forecast. It is difficult for travel, entertainment and local businesses to price excess inventory and to forecast the marketing effort needed to sell excess inventory. The marketing must be cost-effective, because excess inventory is often sold at highly discounted prices, which lowers margins. 

We believe that newspaper, TV and radio advertising, with respect to advertising excess inventory, suffers from a number of limitations which do not apply to the Internet: 

&#8226; 

typically, ads must be submitted 2 to 5 days prior to the publication or airing date, which makes it difficult to advertise last-minute inventory; 

&#8226; 

once an ad is published, it cannot be updated or deleted when an offer is sold out; 

&#8226; 

once an ad is published, the company cannot change a price or offer; 

&#8226; 

in many markets, the small number of newspapers, television companies, radio stations and other print media reduces competition, resulting in high rates for traditional advertising; 

&#8226; 

offline advertising does not allow for detailed performance tracking; and 

&#8226; 

creative content can be very expensive to develop.

&#8226; 

Building a travel and lifestyle brand with a large, high-quality user base. We believe that it is essential to establish a strong brand with a large, high-quality user base within the travel, entertainment and local industries we serve. We currently utilize online marketing and direct marketing to promote our brand to consumers. We utilize sponsorships at industry conferences and public relations to promote our brand. We believe that high-quality content attracts a high-quality user base. 

&#8226; 

Offering products that keep pace with consumer preference and technology. We believe it is important to grow engagement of our user base, by offering products that deliver high-quality deals with exceptional value and expanding our product offering over time to address frequent travel and leisure needs, including the desire to access our content via mobile devices and to search and book hotels via a hotel booking platform.

As discussed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we did not have any advertisers that accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . The agreements with certain advertisers are in the form of multiple insertion orders and merchant agreements from groups of entities under common control. It is possible that we may have an advertiser or advertisers that account for 10% or more of our total revenues in future years because management believes there is a high concentration in the online travel agency industry. 

In 2015 , 8% &#32;of our total revenues were generated from our Asia Pacific operations, 30% &#32;of our total revenues were generated from our European operations and 62% &#32;of our total revenues were generated from our North America operations. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Sales and Marketing 

As of December 31, 2015 , our advertising sales force and sales support staff consisted of 168 employees worldwide. We intend to grow our advertiser base by expanding over time the size of our sales force. 

We currently utilize online marketing and direct marketing to promote our brand to consumers. In addition, we utilize an online marketing program to acquire new members for our e-mail publications. We believe that we build brand awareness by product excellence that is promoted by word-of-mouth. We utilize sponsorships at industry conferences and public relations to promote our brands. 

Technology 

We have designed our technology to serve a large volume of Web traffic and send a large volume of e-mails in an efficient and scalable manner. 

We co-locate our production servers with Equinix, Inc. (&#8220;Equinix&#8221;), a global provider of hosting, network, and application services. Equinix's facilities include features such as power redundancy, multiple egress and peering to other ISPs, fire suppression and access to our own separate physical space. We believe our arrangements with Equinix will allow us to grow without being limited by our own physical and technological capacity, and will also provide us with sufficient bandwidth for our anticipated needs. Because of the design of our websites, our users are not required to download or upload large files from or to our websites, which allows us to continue increasing the number of our visitors and page views without adversely affecting our performance or requiring us to make significant additional capital expenditures. 

Competition 

We compete for advertising dollars with large Internet portal sites such as MSN and Yahoo! that offer listings or other advertising opportunities to travel, entertainment and local businesses. We compete with search engines like Google and Bing that offer pay-per-click listings. We compete with travel meta-search engines like Kayak and online travel and entertainment deal publishers. We compete with large online travel agencies like Expedia, Priceline and TripAdvisor that also offer advertising placements, airline travel comparisons, hotel booking and capture consumer interest. We compete with companies like Groupon, Amazon, Gilt City and LivingSocial that sell vouchers for deals from local businesses such as spas, hotels, restaurants and activity companies. We expect to face increased competition from other Internet and technology-based businesses such as Google and Amazon, each of which has launched initiatives which are directly competitive to our Local Deals &#32;and Getaway &#32;products. In addition, we compete with newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that operate websites which provide advertising opportunities. We expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies, including print media companies, enter our market. We believe that the primary competitive factors are price, performance and audience quality. 

Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger advertiser bases than we do. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive solutions. 

New technologies could increase the competitive pressures that we face. The development of competing technologies by market participants or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position. Competition could result in reduced margins on our services, loss of market share or less use of our products by our advertisers and consumers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

Government Regulation and Legal Uncertainties 

There are increasing numbers of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet, including laws and regulations relating to user privacy, liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online content regulation, and domain name registration. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and developing. 

Privacy Concerns. We are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions. Complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant penalties. We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, and increase our costs and adversely affect our business. 

Anti-Spam Legislation. The CAN-SPAM Act, a federal anti-spam law, pre-empts various state anti-spam laws and establishes a single standard for e-mail marketing and customer communications. We believe that this law, on an overall basis, benefits our business as we do not use spam techniques or practices and may benefit now that others are prohibited from doing so. 

Domain Names . Domain names are the user's Internet &#8220;addresses.&#8221; The current system for registering, allocating and managing domain names has been the subject of litigation and of proposed regulatory reform. We have registered travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.jp, travelzoo.com.au, travelzoo.com.tw, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de, travelzoo.fr, weekend.com, and weekends.com, among other domain names, and have registered &#8220;Travelzoo&#8221; as a trademark in the United States, Canada, and the European Union. In January 2009, we purchased the domain name Fly.com . Because of these protections, it is unlikely, yet possible, that third parties may bring claims for infringement against us for the use of our domain name and trademark. In the event such claims are successful, we could lose the ability to use our domain names. There can be no assurance that our domain names will not lose their value, or that we will not have to obtain entirely new domain names in addition to or in lieu of our current domain names if changes in overall Internet domain name rules result in a restructuring in the current system of using domain names which include &#8220;.com,&#8221; &#8220;.net,&#8221; &#8220;.gov,&#8221; &#8220;.edu&#8221; and other extensions. 

Jurisdictions. Due to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our transmissions over the Internet originate primarily in California, the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate our business activities. In addition, because our service is available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, these jurisdictions may require us to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries, which could subject us to additional taxes and other regulations. &#32; 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our brand names, including Travelzoo and Top 20. If we were unable to protect the Travelzoo and Top 20 &#32;brand names, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely upon a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We have registered the Travelzoo and Top 20 trademarks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered the Travelzoo and Travelzoo Top 20 trademarks with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market of the European Community. We have registered the Travelzoo &#32;trademark in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights, however, may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information. 

We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving. The laws of other countries in which we may market our services in the future are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 473 employees in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. None of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
