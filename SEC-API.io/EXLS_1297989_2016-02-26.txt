 ITEM 1. Business 

ExlService Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;EXL&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us", "our" or the "Company"), incorporated in Delaware in 2002, is a leading Operations Management and Analytics company that helps businesses enhance growth and profitability. Using our proprietary platforms, methodologies and tools we look deeper to help companies improve global operations, enhance data-driven insights, increase customer satisfaction, and manage risk and compliance. We serve the insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services, utilities and travel, transportation and logistics industries, among others. Headquartered in New York, we have more than 24,000 professionals in locations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia (primarily India and the Philippines), Latin America, Australia and South Africa. 

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that align our products and services with how we manage our business, approach our key markets and interact with our clients. Effective for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, we merged two of our operating segments (Operations Consulting and Finance Transformation, previously part of the Analytics and Business Transformation reportable segment) into the Consulting operating segment to reflect recent organizational changes. We have also revised our reportable segments to reflect management&#8217;s focus on the Analytics operating segment. All our other operating segments have been aggregated into the Operations Management reportable segment. The March 2015 acquisition of RPM Direct LLC and RPM Data Solutions, LLC (together &#8220;RPM&#8221;) is included in the Analytics operating segment. 

&#32;Our new reportable segments are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Operations Management, and 

&#8226; 

Analytics. 

We have restated the segment information for all prior years presented herein to conform to the current presentation. This change in segment presentation does not affect our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows.We do not allocate assets by operating segment, although our operating segments do manage and control certain assets. For further descriptions of our operating segments, including financial information regarding revenues and cost of revenues, see Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report. 

Operations Management 

Our Operations Management solutions typically involve the transfer to EXL of select business operations of a client such as claims processing, clinical operations, or financial transaction processing, after which we administer and manage those operations for our client on an ongoing basis. We use a focused industry vertical approach to provide a suite of integrated solutions to organizations in the insurance, healthcare, banking and financial services, utilities, and travel, transportation and logistics industries in addition to providing finance and accounting and consulting solutions across multiple industries. Our Operations Management solutions represented 80.6% of EXL&#8217;s revenues in 2015. 

The key differentiators and salient features of our Operations Management solutions include our agile operating and delivery model utilizing domain expertise and process excellence, the Business EXLerator Framework TM , our ability to deploy a Business Process-as-a-Service (&#8220;BPaaS&#8221;) delivery model, business process automation (including robotics), consulting-driven transformation and our industry vertical focused approach. 

The Business EXLerator Framework TM &#32;is our integrated approach to operations management which enables us to drive better customer outcomes by using advanced automation (such as robotics), workflow management, data visualization and embedded analytics. Inbuilt analytics provides superior decision-making and prioritization to facilitate input optimization and better business outcomes. The Business EXLerator Framework TM &#32;correlates data from multiple sources to create actionable insights for front-line operations and customer service executives and makes use of embedded technology tools, applications and platforms in our clients&#8217; operations. We develop and adopt industry-specific best practices and operational benchmarks to allow us to measure and compare our operation management services to these benchmarks. 

While the majority of our Operations Management services are provided to clients using client-owned or licensed technology platforms, we increasingly deliver our solutions using a BPaaS &#32; delivery model. The BPaaS delivery model includes the provision of a technology platform along with process management services. The service offering typically requires lower capital outlay, is faster to implement and is priced based on the number of transactions or usage by the client. These solutions may use standardized and shared technology and operational delivery infrastructure enabling us to leverage technology and infrastructure investments across multiple clients. 

Insurance: &#32;We are a leader in servicing the insurance industry and currently serve property and casualty (&#8220;P&#38;C&#8221;) insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, annuity and retirement services companies. We have expertise in the areas of claims processing, subrogation, premium and benefit administration, agency management, account reconciliation, policy research, underwriting support, new business processing, policy servicing, premium audit, surveys, billing and collection, commercial and residential survey, and customer service. In 2015, the research firm Everest Group ranked EXL as a &#8220;Leader&#8221; in the both U.S. &#8220;Property &#38; Casualty Insurance BPO PEAK Matrix&#8482; Assessment 2015&#8221;and the U.S. "Life and Pensions Insurance BPO market". 

We have intensified our use of proprietary technology tools and platforms to provide increasingly complex services to the insurance industry. Research group HfS placed us in the Winner&#8217;s Circle in the domain of providing Insurance-As-a-Service in 2015. Additionally, we were awarded the &#8220;XCelent Award for Customer Base&#8221; in Celent&#8217;s &#8220;North American Policy Administration Systems 2015: Life, Annuities, Pension, and Health ABCD Vendor View&#8221;. &#32; We have invested in creating BPaaS solutions for the insurance industry through several of the acquisitions we have made and by building in-house technology platforms. In 2015, we continued to develop and deploy new platforms that provide distinctive services to our clients. In support of our claims management offering, we introduced a medical bill review capability that, used in conjunction with our medical record summarization product, provides a comprehensive view of medical claims. Bills are evaluated for relevancy and accuracy.

Business Strategy 

We are a leading operations management and analytics company that help businesses enhance growth and profitability. Specific elements of our strategy include: 

Deploying our Business EXLerator Framework TM &#32;in Operations Management 

In servicing our Operations Management clients, we differentiate ourselves by using our proprietary and award-winning Business EXLerator Framework TM , which is a proprietary delivery model that incorporates industry benchmarks, advanced automation, Lean Six Sigma methodologies, BluePrint methodology, analytics and technology to provide significantly improved business outcomes. Where we have successfully deployed the Business EXLerator Framework TM , we have experienced significant increases in the efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of client operations while simultaneously mitigating risk, creating value and generating business impact. Business EXLerator has helped EXL win new clients as well as increase satisfaction with existing clients. Advanced automation is another key element where we leverage proprietary and partner technologies to drive eliminate work and provide a step-change in the degrees of automation (such as robotics) embedded within the process. 

Developing Business Process as a Service (&#8220;BPaaS&#8221;) Solutions 

We have increased our investment and focus in developing BPaaS and technology-enabled product solutions. We believe we are well-positioned to shift part of our servicing model in niche Operations Management services, from our current model to a BPaaS servicing model that offers an integrated technology platform with operations management services. BPaaS services are typically delivered using a transaction-based or outcome-based pricing model and can minimize a client&#8217;s initial capital investment on technology. In addition to proprietary solutions, we intend to enter into additional partnerships to develop and take-to-market new BPaaS solutions. 

Building Additional Analytics Capabilities and Solution Offerings 

We continue to invest in our Analytics capabilities by expanding our solution offerings, enhancing the skill sets and training of our team, and developing reusable intellectual property that can be incorporated into our analytics solutions. We intend to further increase our investment in our proprietary methodology solutions and algorithms that help us improve our ability to predict outcomes for our clients to help them capture data signals in a more efficient manner. In order to optimize the way in which we deliver analytics solutions to clients and source the highest quality global talent, we intend to further expand our multi-shore delivery capabilities by adding to our team of professionals in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, India, Singapore and the Philippines. In addition to hiring directly from educational institutions, we expect to hire additional experienced senior team members in order to deepen our industry expertise and thought leadership. 

Extending Our Industry Expertise 

We intend to further extend our knowledge and capabilities in the industry verticals we serve in order to enhance our reputation as a leading provider of business process solutions. By focusing on transitioning and managing more complex and value-enhancing services we can enhance our capability to serve our clients. In order to market our base of experience externally, we intend to produce additional primary research and opinion pieces in order to enhance our reputation as industry thought leaders. 

Recruiting, Training, and Retaining the Most Talented Professionals 

We have instituted an integrated talent management framework through active collaboration between our recruitment, capability development and business HR functions. We deploy innovative methods to recruit, train and retain our skilled employees. We intend to focus on recruiting the right talent and develop them further on relevant competencies through our learning academies, rigorous promotion standards, industry-specific training and competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation. We supplement our scope of operations experience with several industry-specific domain academies to enhance the specialization quotient of our employees. 

Cultivating Long-term Relationships and Expanding our Client Base 

We continue to maintain our focus on cultivating long-term client relationships as well as attracting new clients. We believe there are significant opportunities for additional growth within our existing clients, and we seek to expand these relationships by: 

&#8226; 

Increasing the depth and breadth of the services we provide across new client business, functions and geographies 

&#8226; 

Offering the full suite of EXL services that includes operations management, analytics, consulting and technology 

&#8226; 

Supporting our clients&#8217; geographic expansion leveraging our global footprint 

We intend to build a portfolio of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies in our focus industries that have the most complex and diverse processes and, accordingly, stand to benefit significantly from our services. We also intend to initiate long-term relationships with medium-sized companies in our focus industries leveraging our BPaaS and technology offerings. 

Expanding our Global Delivery Footprint and Operational Infrastructure 

We intend to further expand and invest in our network of delivery centers to service our clients. In 2015, we opened new operations centers in Gurgaon, India, Bogota, Colombia and Cape Town, South Africa and a sales office in Sydney, Australia. In 2015, the acquisition of RPM added an office in Lambertville, New Jersey. 

Pursuing Strategic Relationships and Acquisitions 

We intend to continue making selective acquisitions in our focus industry verticals as well as to add to our capabilities. We intend to selectively consider strategic relationships with industry leaders that add new long-term client relationships, enhance the depth and breadth of our services and complement our business strategy. We also intend to selectively consider partnerships, alliances or investments that will expand the scope and effectiveness of our services by adding proprietary technology assets and intellectual property, adding new clients or allowing us to enter new geographic markets. 

Our Industry 

Operations Management 

Business Process Management (&#8220;BPM&#8221;) service providers work with clients to transfer their key business processes to reduce costs, improve process quality, handle increased transaction volumes and reduce redundancy. BPM providers can enable organizations to enhance profitability and increase efficiency and reliability, permitting them to concentrate on their core areas of competence. BPM is a long-term strategic commitment for a company that, once implemented, is generally not subject to cyclical spending or information technology budget fluctuations. Increased global demand, cost improvements in international communications and the automation of many business services have created a significant opportunity for BPM providers with offshore delivery capabilities, and many companies are moving select office processes to providers with the capacity to perform these functions from overseas locations. We believe the demand for BPM services will be primarily led by industries that are transaction-driven and that require significant customer interactions. 

According to India&#8217;s National Association of Software and Service Companies (&#8220;NASSCOM&#8221;), an industry trade organization, exports from India in the information technology and BPM industry are expected to grow at 12.3% year-over-year in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 and expects 10%-12% growth in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. According to International Data Corporation, (&#8220;IDC&#8221;), an industry market intelligence advisory firm, BPM should grow at over 14% from 2015-2018. 

Companies are increasingly looking to BPM service providers to provide a suite of analytics services including statistical tools, models and techniques to clean, organize and examine structured and unstructured corporate data. This data is then used by companies to generate specific business-related analysis and insights into their business and prospects. The enhanced generation of business data across multiple formats, substantial reduction in data storage costs, growing enterprise demand for data-driven and real-time decision making and availability of sophisticated analytics tools have enabled companies to overcome a local shortage of specialized analytics talent and benefit from global labor markets. BPM service providers who can develop industry-specific analytics expertise are especially well poised to benefit from this global trend. 

Analytics 

We believe the demand for Analytics solutions in many of our key verticals, including banking and financial services, insurance and healthcare, is growing strongly and will continue to do so for the next several years. According to NASSCOM, Analytics services outsourcing growth is expected to be 14.3% from a $42 billion market in 2012 to $71 billion in 2016. India has emerged as a leading delivery location for analytics, driven by a large quantitatively-trained workforce and attractive cost efficiencies, as compared to other locations. 

Sales, Marketing and Client Management 

We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting and EXL consulting. Our sales and client management teams operate from the U.S., Europe and Australia and are supported by our business development team. 

Our sales, marketing and business development teams are responsible for new client acquisitions, public relations, relations with outsourcing advisory companies, analyst relations and rankings, lead generation, knowledge management, content development, campaign management, digital/web presence, brand awareness and participation in industry forums and conferences. As of December 31, 2015, we employed nearly 100 sales, marketing, business development and client management professionals with the majority of them based in either the U.S. or Europe. Our professionals generally have significant experience in business process solutions, technology, operations, analytics and consulting. 

Clients 

EXL generated revenues from over 700 clients in 2015 and over 600 clients in 2014. 

Our top three, five and ten clients generated 17.3%, 25.0% and 40.5% of our revenues, respectively, in 2015. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 20.5%, 29.4% and 47.4% of our revenues, respectively, in 2014. No client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2015 or 2014. While we have reduced our revenue concentration with our top clients and are developing relationships with new clients to diversify our client base, we believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We have a limited number of clients and provide services to a few industries.&#8221; 

Our long-term relationships with our clients typically evolve from providing a single, discrete solution or process into providing a series of complex, integrated processes across multiple business lines. For Operations Management services, we enter into long-term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms of between three and five years. Agreements for Analytics services are either project based or having shorter initial terms, which are typically between one to three years. Each agreement is individually negotiated with the client. 

Competition 

Competition in the BPM services industry is intense and growing. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We face significant competition from U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based BPM and information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) companies and from our clients, who may build shared services centers to perform these services themselves, either in-house, in the U.S. or through offshore groups or other arrangements.&#8221; Many companies, including certain of our clients, choose to perform some or all of their customer-facing and back-office processes internally, utilizing their own employees to provide these services as part of their regular business operations. Some companies have moved portions of their in-house customer management functions offshore, including to offshore affiliates. We believe our key advantage over in-house business processes management is that we provide companies the opportunity to focus on their core products and markets while we focus on service delivery and operational excellence. We compete primarily against: 

&#8226; 

BPM service companies with delivery capability in offshore locations, particularly India, such as Genpact Limited and WNS (Holdings) Limited; 

&#8226; 

BPM divisions of large global IT service companies, such as Accenture, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services; 

&#8226; 

Niche providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area such as analytics or healthcare; and 

&#8226; 

Leading accounting and management consulting firms. 

We compete against these entities by working to establish ourselves as a service provider with deep industry expertise, strong client relationships, leading industry talent, superior operational and process capabilities, differentiated technology and BPaaS solutions, and sophisticated analytic and consulting capabilities, which enable us to respond rapidly to market trends and the evolving needs of our clients. 

Intellectual Property 

Our principal intellectual property consists of, proprietary and licensed platforms, trade secrets, know-how of our management and employees, trademarks, copyrighted software and other materials, patents and pending patent applications. We have several registered trademarks and logos and pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and certain foreign jurisdictions. We consider our business processes and implementation methodologies to be trade secrets or confidential proprietary information. Clients and business partners sign nondisclosure agreements requiring confidential treatment of our information. Our employees are required to sign work-for-hire and confidentiality covenants as a condition to their employment. 

In addition to our own proprietary and licensed software, tools and methodologies, to provide our services we use software licensed by us from third parties, as well as software licensed by our clients from third parties and available on their systems. We customarily enter into licensing and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and third parties with respect to the use of their software systems and platforms. 

Our contracts usually specify that EXL will use or develop proprietary tools during a client engagement that will be owned by EXL, or may provide that intellectual property created during an engagement for a client will be considered to be &#8220;work for hire&#8221; for the client, but we typically retain a license or future rights with respect to such work product. 

Information Security and Data Privacy 

We have a strong focus on information security, data privacy and the protection of our clients&#8217; and their customers&#8217; confidential information. We have made significant investments to strengthen our information security posture and protocols to ensure compliance with the established confidentiality policies and the laws and regulations governing our activities. These investments involve ensuring we have the appropriate people, processes and technology in place to protect information throughout its life cycle. 

We seek to protect our clients&#8217; information and adhere to information security and data privacy standards. In 2015, EXL received an award for excellence in information security by industry association NASSCOM and the Data Security Council of India (&#8220;DSCI&#8221;). This award recognized EXL as an &#8220;industry leader&#8221; in the BPM category for our industry initiatives in information security. 

According to the needs of our clients as well as the regulatory requirements of the geographies in which we operate, most of our delivery centers are certified in regard to quality, information security and employee safety, such as the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management system, the ISO 27001:2013 standard for our information security management system and the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard for our occupational health and safety management system. Some of our centers in the Philippines and certain client processes in other operation centers in India are certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 3 (PCI-DSS) requirements. Our South Africa delivery center is also certified to latest PCI-DSS v3.1 requirements. We engage independent firms to conduct General Controls and business process specific SSAE 16 (SOC I - Type II) assessments. 

&#32;EXL offers managed hosting environments for our BPaaS solutions in the insurance and healthcare verticals. Clients who adopt our BPaaS solutions on a managed hosted basis are offered a highly reliable, scalable, and secure hosting environment. The technology applications are hosted in ISO 27001certified, SSAE16 SOC1 Compliant Tier 4 data centers that are proactively monitored and managed 24 hours a day to meet the client&#8217;s business requirements. 

We have a robust, wide area network and international telecommunications capacity to support our global business operations. Our infrastructure is built to industry standards, leveraging leading technology providers and partners. Our business continuity management includes plans to mitigate and manage operational risks by building resilience and redundancy in our telecommunications and network infrastructure, applications and IT infrastructure, utilities and power, and trained talent across our service delivery locations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a headcount of approximately 24,100 employees, with approximately 17,200 employees based in India and approximately 4,400 employees in the Philippines. We have approximately 1,700 employees in the U.S, 100 employees in the U.K., and 700 employees in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania and other geographies. None of our employees are unionized. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe that we enjoy good employee relations. 

Hiring and Recruiting 

Our employees are critical to the success of our business. Accordingly, we focus on recruiting, training and retaining our professionals. We have developed effective strategies that enable an efficient recruitment process. We have approximately 100 employees dedicated to recruitment. Some of the strategies we have adopted to increase efficiency in our hiring practices include the utilization of online voice assessments and a centralized hiring center. Our hiring policies focus on identifying high quality employees who demonstrate a propensity for learning, contribution to client services and growth. Candidates must undergo numerous tests and interviews before we extend offers for employment. We also conduct background checks on candidates, including criminal background checks, where permitted and as required by clients or on a sample basis. In addition, where permitted and required for client services, we perform random drug testing on the workforce on a regular basis. 

We offer our employees competitive compensation packages that include incentive-based compensation and offer a variety of benefits that vary by facility, including free transport to and from home in certain circumstances, subsidized meals and free access to recreational facilities that are located within some of our operations centers. Our attrition rate for employees who had been with EXL for more than 180 days was 33.3% and 32.3% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As competition in our industry increases, our turnover rate could increase. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations, as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates.&#8221; 

Capability Development and Training 

We have a strong focus on the capability development and training of our employees. We have built up a world class global learning capability, which we believe acts as a crucial differentiator for us in the marketplace and amongst our employees. Our learning and development teams partner with business units and corporate functions to create an integrated talent development process focusing on skill development, the needs of our clients and industry certification. This creates thought leaders with high industry acumen who are better able to address our clients&#8217; requirements. We also provide a career linked learning path to our employees from new hires to tenured employees to senior levels of leadership. We have created several proprietary academies to enhance our domain expertise in our employees and to build specialization, across our verticals including our Insurance Academy, Travel Academy, Finance and Accounting Academy, Healthcare Academy and our Analytics Academy. Our training includes behavioral and functional components to enhance and ensure job readiness as well as also boosting ongoing productivity and effectiveness. We have a global presence catering to the specific learning requirements of each geography. We provide learning through our blended learning methodology comprising of classroom, on the job coaching and technology led learning. 

Regulation 

Because of the diverse and highly complex nature of our service offerings, our operations are subject to a variety of rules, regulations and statutes in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services. Several U.S. and foreign federal and state agencies regulate aspects of our business. In addition, our clients may contractually require that we comply with certain rules and regulations that are applicable to their specific industry. Failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

We are one of the few service providers that can provide third-party administrator insurance services from India and the Philippines and are currently able to provide such services for 45 states and 16 states, respectively. Additionally, we are licensed or otherwise eligible to provide third-party administrator services in all states within the U.S. Certain of our debt collection, utilization review, workers compensation utilization review and telemarketing services require us to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions or require certain categories of our professionals to be individually licensed. Our facility in Manila, Philippines, is accredited by Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (&#8220;URAC&#8221;), a leading healthcare and education accreditation organization. We continue to obtain licenses required from time to time by our business operations. 

Our operations are also subject to compliance with a variety of other laws, including the U.S. federal and state regulations that apply to certain portions of our business such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economics and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation rules and regulations. We must also comply with applicable regulations relating to health and other personal information that we process as part of our services. Additionally, our client contracts may specify other regulatory requirements we must meet in connection with the services we provide. We provide our employees with training for applicable laws and regulations. 

We benefit from tax relief provided by laws and regulations in India and the Philippines. Regulation of our business by the Indian government affects us in several ways. During the last several years, we either established or acquired new centers that are eligible for tax benefits under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (the &#8220;SEZ Act&#8221;). The SEZ Act introduced a 15-year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones (&#8220;SEZs&#8221;). Under the SEZ Act, qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to (i) 100% of their export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations; (ii) 50% of such export profits for the next five years; and (iii) 50% of the export profits for a further five years, subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements. The SEZ Act provides, among other restrictions, that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment (beyond a prescribed limit) to new SEZ locations. We anticipate establishing additional operations centers in SEZs or other tax advantaged locations in the future. See &#8220;Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks related to the International nature of our business - Our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments introduce new legislation, reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry or if we are not eligible for these benefits.&#8221; 

We also benefit from a corporate tax holiday in the Philippines for our operations centers established there over the last several years. The Company registered with the Philippines Economic Zone Authority (&#8220;PEZA&#8221;) and is inter-alia, eligible for income tax exemption for four years. This exemption incentive may be extended in certain instances upon fulfillment of certain conditions. Following the expiry of the tax exemption, income generated from centers in Philippines will be taxed at the prevailing annual tax rate, which is currently 5.0% on the gross income.
