 Item 1. Business

Business Overview

Geospace Technologies Corporation reincorporated as a Texas corporation effective April 16, 2015. We originally incorporated as a Delaware corporation on September 27, 1994. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Geospace Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. We design and manufacture instruments and equipment used in the oil and gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate, characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs. We also design and manufacture non-seismic products, including industrial products, offshore cables and imaging equipment. We report and categorize our customers and products into two different segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic.

We have engaged in the seismic instrument and equipment business since 1980 and market our products primarily to the oil and gas industry. Demand for our products has been, and will likely continue to be, vulnerable to downturns in the economy and the oil and gas industry in general. For more information, please refer to the risks discussed under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

Products and Product Development

Seismic Products

Our seismic business segment has historically accounted for the majority of our revenue. Geoscientists use seismic data primarily in connection with the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves to map potential and known hydrocarbon bearing formations and the geologic structures that surround them. Our seismic product lines currently consist of land and marine nodal data acquisition systems, permanent land and seabed reservoir monitoring products and services, geophones and geophone strings, hydrophones, leader wire, connectors, telemetry cables, marine streamer retrieval and steering devices and various other products. Our seismic products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use. We believe that our seismic products are among the most technologically advanced instruments and equipment available for seismic data acquisition.

Traditional Products

An energy source and a data recording system are combined to acquire seismic data. We provide many of the components of seismic data recording systems, including geophones, hydrophones, multi-component sensors, leader wire, geophone strings, connectors, seismic telemetry cables and other seismic related products. On land, our customers use geophones, leader wire, cables and connectors to receive and measure seismic reflections resulting from an energy source into data recording units, which store the seismic information for subsequent processing and analysis. In the marine environment, large ocean-going vessels tow long seismic cables known as &#8220;streamers&#8221; containing hydrophones which are used to detect pressure changes. Hydrophones transmit electrical impulses back to the vessel&#8217;s data recording unit where the seismic data is stored for subsequent processing and analysis. Our marine seismic products also help steer streamers while being towed and help recover streamers if they become disconnected from the vessel.

Our seismic sensor, cable and connector products are compatible with most major competitive seismic data acquisition systems currently in use. Revenue from these products results primarily from seismic contractors purchasing our products as components of new seismic data acquisition systems or to repair and replace components of seismic data acquisition systems already in use.

Our products used in marine seismic data acquisition include our seismic streamer retrieval devices (&#8220;SRDs&#8221;). Occasionally, streamer cables are severed and become disconnected from the vessel as a result of obstacles, inclement weather, vessel traffic or human error. Our SRDs, which are attached to the streamer cables, contain air bags which are designed to inflate automatically at a given water depth, bringing the severed streamer cables to the surface. These SRDs save the seismic contractors significant time and money compared to the alternative of losing the streamer cable. We also produce seismic streamer steering devices, or &#8220;birds,&#8221; which are fin-like devices that attach to the streamer cable. These birds help maintain the streamer cable at a certain desired depth as it is being towed through the water.

&#160;

Wireless Products 

We have developed a land-based wireless (or nodal) seismic data acquisition system called the GSX. Rather than utilizing interconnecting cables as required by most traditional land data acquisition systems, each GSX station operates as an independent data collection system, allowing our GSX stations to be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations. As a result, our GSX system requires less maintenance, which we believe allows our customers to operate more effectively and efficiently because of its reduced environmental impact, lower weight and ease of operation. Our GSX system is designed into configurations ranging from one to four channels per station. Since its introduction in 2008 and through September 30, 2016, we have sold 336,000 GSX channels and we have 127,000 GSX channels in our rental fleet. We do not expect to expand our GSX rental fleet in the foreseeable future.

We have also developed a marine-based wireless seismic data acquisition system called the OBX. Similar to our GSX land-based wireless system, the marine OBX system can be deployed in virtually unlimited channel configurations and does not require interconnecting cables between each station. Our deep water versions of the OBX system can be deployed in depths of up to 3,450 meters. Through September 30, 2016, we have sold 460 OBX stations and we have 5,700 OBX stations in our rental fleet. In the absence of additional customer orders for OBX systems, we do not expect to make to make any cash investments into our OBX rental fleet during fiscal year 2017.

Reservoir Products

Seismic surveys repeated over selected time intervals show dynamic changes within the reservoir and can be used to monitor the effects of oil and gas production. In this regard, we have developed permanently installed high-definition reservoir monitoring systems for land and ocean-bottom applications in producing oil and gas fields. We also produce a retrievable version of our ocean-bottom system for use on fields where permanently installed systems are not appropriate or economical. Utilizing these tools, producers can enhance the recovery of oil and gas deposits over the life of a reservoir.

Our high-definition reservoir monitoring products include the HDSeis&#8482; product line and a suite of borehole and reservoir monitoring products and services. Our HDSeis&#8482; system is a high-definition seismic data acquisition system with flexible architecture that allows it to be configured as a borehole seismic system or as a subsurface system for both land and marine reservoir-monitoring projects. The scalable architecture of the HDSeis&#8482; system enables custom designed system configuration for applications ranging from low-channel engineering and environmental-scale surveys requiring a minimum number of recording channels to high-channel surveys required to efficiently conduct permanent reservoir imaging and monitoring. Modular architecture allows virtually unlimited channel expansion. In addition, multi-system synchronization features make the HDSeis&#8482; system well suited for multi-well or multi-site acquisition, simultaneous surface and downhole acquisition and continuous reservoir monitoring projects.

Reservoir monitoring requires special purpose or custom designed systems in which portability becomes less critical and functional reliability assumes greater importance. This reliability factor helps assure successful operations in inaccessible locations over a considerable period of time. Additionally, reservoirs located in deep water or harsh environments require special instrumentation and new techniques to maximize recovery. Reservoir monitoring also requires high-bandwidth, high-resolution seismic data for engineering project planning and reservoir management. We believe our HDSeis&#8482; System and tools, designed for cost-effective deployment and lifetime performance, will make borehole and seabed seismic acquisition a cost-effective and reliable process for the challenges of reservoir monitoring. Our multi-component seismic product developments include an omni-directional geophone for use in reservoir monitoring, a compact marine three-component or four-component gimbaled sensor and special-purpose connectors, connector arrays and cases.

In November 2012, we received an order from Statoil (the &#8220;Statoil Order&#8221;) for $171.7 million, including amendments, to instrument two reservoirs in the North Sea. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $109.6 million and $62.1 million, respectively, from the Statoil Order using the percentage of completion revenue recognition method. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, we also delivered a $5.0 million permanent land reservoir monitoring system for use in Saudi Arabia and a $4.4 million system to enlarge BP&#8217;s existing Valhall field system. We did not deliver nor did we receive orders for any permanent reservoir monitoring systems during fiscal year 2015 and 2016.

In addition, we produce seismic borehole acquisition systems which employ a fiber optic augmented wireline capable of very high data transmission rates. These systems are used for several reservoir monitoring applications, including an application pioneered by us allowing operators and service companies to monitor and measure the results of fracturing operations.

&#160;

Non-Seismic Products 

Our non-seismic businesses leverage upon our existing manufacturing facilities and engineering capabilities. We have found that many of our seismic products, with little or no modification, have direct application to industries beyond those involved in oil and gas exploration and development. For example, our customers utilize our borehole tools to monitor subsurface carbon dioxide injections and for mine safety applications.

Our non-seismic products include electronic pre-press products that employ direct thermal imaging and digital inkjet printing technologies targeted at the commercial graphics, industrial graphics, textile and flexographic printing industries. These industrial products include (i) sensors and tools for vibration monitoring, mine safety application and earthquake detection, (ii) cables for power and communication for the offshore oil and gas and offshore construction industries, (iii) water meter cables and connectors, and (iv) other specialty industrial cable and connector products.

Business Strategy

Our business strategy is focused on continued investment in research and development, expansion of our manufacturing and engineering capacity, expansion of our seismic equipment rental business, selective acquisitions, reinvestment of profits and minimizing debt obligations.

&#160;

&#8226; 

Continue Investment in Research and Development &#8211; Historically, our growth has been driven through our internal development of new products targeted at the seismic industry. In past years, our seismic product innovations included the introduction of borehole seismology tools, seabed permanent reservoir monitoring systems and wireless data acquisition systems for both land and marine applications. These innovative technologies are the result of our continuous investment in research and development initiatives, even during difficult industry cycles when we experience a significant decline in customer demand for our products. We believe our past growth is a direct result of this strategy and we intend to continue such research and development investments. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Attract and Retain Engineering Staff &#8211; Our engineering staff has been key to our success; we intend to continue our tradition of retaining and attracting engineering staff and providing appropriate compensation and benefits. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Expand Manufacturing and Engineering Capacity to Accommodate Future Growth &#8211; Our new product innovations led to significant revenue growth in previous years. Since our initial public offering in 1997, and through fiscal year 2016, we have expanded our manufacturing, warehousing, engineering and office space from 99,000 square feet to 610,000 square feet. Early in fiscal year 2013, we received the Statoil Order which required us to design and manufacture two seabed permanent reservoir monitoring systems. This order required substantially all of our manufacturing capacity and capabilities for a period of approximately 18 months, requiring us to outsource many of our routine manufacturing activities and to turn away potential customer orders for other products. Furthermore, we had no spare manufacturing capacity to accommodate any other large order for a permanent reservoir monitoring system, should one have occurred. We believe we are the world leader in the design and manufacture of these systems. As such, we expect to receive future orders for large-scale reservoir monitoring systems which may exceed the magnitude of the Statoil Order, although the timing and frequency of such orders, if any, is unknown. We are currently experiencing depressed industry conditions as a result of lower crude oil prices and their impact upon capital spending in the oil and gas industry worldwide. The resulting significant decline in seismic product orders and, in particular, the lack of any orders for permanent reservoir monitoring systems, have required us to defer our plans to expand our manufacturing and engineering facilities until product demand, including demand for large permanent reservoir monitoring systems, and factory capacity utilization return to levels comparable to those we experienced during fiscal year 2013. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Pursue the Seismic Equipment Rental Business &#8211; We have offered seismic equipment to our customers on a rental basis for many years, originally through our subsidiary in Canada. Following our introduction of new wireless data acquisition technology in 2008, we began offering our newly introduced GSX systems for rent in 2009. At September 30, 2016, our rental fleet contained 127,000 GSX channels which are warehoused in North and South America. Many current owners of our GSX channels were initially introduced to the product through a rental. We believe this rental strategy has contributed to the sale of 336,000 GSX channels since its introduction in 2008. We have also expanded this rental strategy to our marine OBX wireless system. At September 30, 2016, our rental fleet contained 5,700 OBX stations. Since demand has declined substantially for the rental of our GSX equipment due to the significant underutilization of customer-owned land data acquisition systems, we have no expectation of increasing our GSX rental fleet in the foreseeable future. However, in light of on-going discussions with customers and existing quotations outstanding for OBX systems, we believe our OBX rental revenue could increase in fiscal year 2017, although we can offer no assurances of such an increase due to the lack of executed firm rental contracts. In order to meet this potential demand, we could be required to place additional OBX stations into our rental fleet. We believe our rental business creates opportunities for us to demonstrate the qualities and benefits of new products like the GSX and OBX to potential customers without requiring the customer to make a large upfront capital investment. As a result, we will continue adding new product technologies to our rental fleet to meet customer demand. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; 

Selectively Pursue Acquisitions of Businesses with Technological and Engineering Overlap &#8211; The seismic industry periodically experiences volatile b usiness cycles requiring us to rapidly increase and decrease our business activities to meet the industry&#8217;s demand for our products. The seismic industry generally offers equipment manufacturers like us limited visibility into new orders creating challeng es for us to manage our manufacturing capacity, workforce and working capital. While our primary growth initiative is to expand our seismic product offerings, we may also seek out other non-seismic business opportunities which complement our existing prod ucts, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and company-wide culture. While we routinely evaluate both seismic and non-seismic business acquisition opportunities, we may direct these efforts toward non-seismic businesses in order to diversify our re venue base and expose us to different markets with different business cycles. 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Reinvest Profits and Minimize Debt Obligations &#8211; Our growth over the years has resulted from the reinvestment of our cash profits back into engineering projects, plant additions, rental fleet development and expansion, small niche acquisitions and working capital expansion. While we are not opposed to moderate amounts of short-term debt during favorable business cycles, we choose to minimize our exposure to long-term debt obligations which, in our view, restrict our ability to operate during periodic difficult business cycles in the seismic industry similar to the current business environment. We believe this strategy has allowed us to achieve higher revenue and profit growth than our peers, many of whom have significant long-term debt burdens. We also believe that the value of our common shares outstanding will be best served in the long-term by reinvesting our cash profits back into the business. In this regard, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, nor do we expect to initiate a buy-back program to repurchase our common stock. 

Segment and Geographic Information

We report and categorize our revenue and products into two business segments: Seismic and Non-Seismic. Our Seismic product segments currently include traditional exploration products, wireless exploration products and reservoir products. Our Non-Seismic product segments include imaging and industrial products. Frequently, we receive a minor amount of Seismic product revenue from our Non-Seismic customers. For a discussion of financial information by segment and geographic area, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

Seismic Products

We are one of the world&#8217;s largest designers and manufacturers of seismic related products. The principal competitors for many of our traditional seismic products are Sercel (a division of CGG), ION Geophysical (&#8220;ION&#8221;) and INOVA (a joint venture formed in 2009 between ION and Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company). Furthermore, entities in China affiliated with Sercel as well as other Chinese manufacturers produce low-cost geophones meeting current industry standards. Geophones are generally price sensitive, so the ability to manufacture these products at a low cost is essential to maintain market share. We believe our primary competitor in the manufacture of our marine products is Sercel.

The primary competitors for our land wireless data acquisition systems are Sercel, FairfieldNodal, INOVA, Wireless Seismic and numerous smaller entities. We believe the primary competitors for our marine nodal data acquisition systems are marine seismic data acquisition service providers like FairfieldNodal, Seabed Geosolutions (a joint venture formed between Fugro and CGG), and Magseis ASA, each of whom utilizes their own proprietary nodal technology. For land and marine wireless data acquisition systems, while price is an important factor in a customer&#8217;s decision to purchase the product, we believe customers also place a high value on a product&#8217;s historical performance and the ongoing engineering and field support provided by the product&#8217;s manufacturer.

Our primary competitors for rental of our traditional and wireless seismic equipment are Mitcham Industries, Inc. and Seismic Equipment Solutions.

Our primary competitors for our seabed permanent reservoir monitoring systems are Alcatel-Lucent and Petroleum Geo-Services ASA. We believe our primary competitors for high-definition borehole seismic data acquisition systems are Avalon Sciences Ltd and Sercel. A product&#8217;s historical performance, field support and engineering capabilities are important factors for receiving orders for our seismic reservoir products.

The principal keys for success in the seismic instruments and equipment market are technological superiority, product durability, reliability, and customer support. Price and product delivery are always important considerations for our customers. In general, most customers prefer to standardize data acquisition systems, geophones and hydrophones, particularly if they are used by seismic companies that have multiple crews which are able to support each other. This standardization makes it difficult for competitive manufacturers to gain market share from other manufacturers with existing customer relationships.

&#160;

As mentioned above, a key factor for seismic instruments and equipment manufacturers i s durability under harsh field conditions. Seismic instruments and equipment must meet not only rigorous technical specifications regarding signal integrity and sensitivity, but must also be extremely rugged and durable to withstand the rigors of field us e, often in harsh environments. 

Non-Seismic Products

There are numerous competitors and competitive technologies including other direct thermal printer manufacturers and manufacturers of direct-to-screen and inkjet solutions. Our non-seismic industrial products face competition from numerous domestic and international specialty product manufacturers.

Suppliers

We purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers located in various countries. We typically have multiple suppliers for our critical materials. We purchase all of our thermal film from a single supplier. Except for the film sold to us by this supplier, we know of no other source for thermal firm that performs as well in our thermal imaging equipment. In addition, certain models of our marine wireless products use a timing device manufactured by a single supplier. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other source for this device. For a discussion of the risks related to our reliance on these suppliers, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; We Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products.&#8221;

We do not currently experience any significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials from our suppliers for the production of our seismic or non-seismic products.

Product Manufacturing and Assembly

Our manufacturing and product assembly operations consist of machining, molding or cabling the necessary component parts, configuring these parts along with components received from various vendors and assembling a final product. We manufacture seismic equipment to the specifications of our customers. For example, we can armor cables for applications such as deep water uses. We assemble geophone strings and seismic telemetry cables based on a number of customer choices such as length, gauge, tolerance and color of molded parts. Upon completion of our manufacturing and assembly operations, we test our final products to the functional and, in the case of seismic equipment, environmental extremes of product specifications and inspect the products for quality assurance. Consistent with industry practice, we normally manufacture and ship our products based on customer orders and, therefore, typically do not maintain significant inventories of finished goods held for sale, although we do stock significant amounts of finished good sub-assemblies in anticipation of future customer orders.

Markets and Customers

Our principal customers for our traditional and wireless seismic products are seismic contractors and, to a lesser extent, major independent and government-owned oil and gas companies that either operate their own seismic crews or specify seismic instrument and equipment preferences to contractors. For our deep water permanent reservoir monitoring products, our customers are generally large international oil and gas companies that operate long-term offshore oil and gas producing properties. Our graphics imaging customers primarily consist of direct users of our equipment as well as specialized resellers that focus on the screenprinting and flexographic printing industries. Our industrial product customers consist of specialty manufacturers, research institutions and industrial product distributors. One customer comprised 18.5% of our revenue during fiscal year 2016. No customer comprised 10% of our revenue during fiscal year 2015. Revenue recognition for the Statoil Order comprised 26.2% of our revenue during fiscal year 2014. The following table describes our revenue by customer type (in thousands):

Intellectual Property 

We seek to protect our intellectual property by means of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other measures. We hold patents on geophones, micro-geophones, seismic data acquisition, in-line retrieval devices and water meter connectors, and we have pending applications on related technology. We do not consider any single patent essential to our success. Our patents are scheduled to expire at various dates through 2034. At this time we are not able to predict the effect of any patent expiration. We protect our proprietary rights to our technology through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.

Research and Development

We expect to incur significant future research and development expenditures aimed at the development of additional seismic and non-seismic products. We have incurred company-sponsored research and development expenses of $13.9 million, $14.7 million and $16.5 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Employees

As of September 30, 2016, we employed 785 people predominantly on a full-time basis, of which 490 were employed in the United States, 256 in the Russian Federation and the remainder in the United Kingdom, Canada, China and Colombia. A majority of our employees in the Russian Federation belong to a regional union for machine manufacturers. Our remaining employees are not unionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
