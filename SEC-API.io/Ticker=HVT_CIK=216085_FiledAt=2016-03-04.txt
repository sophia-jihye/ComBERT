 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms "Havertys," "we," "our," or "us" when referring to the consolidated operations of Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc.

Overview

Havertys is a specialty retailer of residential furniture and accessories. Our founder, J.J. Haverty began the business in 1885 in Atlanta, Georgia with one store and made deliveries using horse-drawn wagons. The Company grew to 18 stores and accessed additional capital for growth through its initial public offering in October 1929.

Havertys has grown to 121 stores in 16 states in the Southern and Midwest regions. All of our retail locations are operated using the Havertys name and we do not franchise our stores. Our customers are generally college educated women in middle to upper-middle income households. Our brand recognition is very high in the markets we serve and consumer surveys indicate Havertys is associated with a high level of quality, fashion, value and service.

Merchandise and Revenues

We develop our merchandise selection with the tastes of the diverse "on trend" consumer in mind. A wide range of styles from traditional to contemporary are in our core assortment and most of the furniture merchandise we carry bears the Havertys brand. We also tailor our product offerings to the needs and tastes of the local markets we serve emphasizing more "coastal," "western" or "urban" looks as appropriate. Our custom upholstery programs and eclectic looks are an important part of our product mix and allow the on trend consumer more self-expression.

We have avoided offering lower quality, promotional price-driven merchandise favored by many regional and national chains, which we believe would devalue the Havertys brand with the consumer. We carry nationally well-known mattress product lines such as Sealy&#174;, Serta&#174;, Stearns &#38; Foster&#174;, and

Tempur-Pedic&#174;.

Our customers use varying methods to purchase or finance their sales. As an added convenience to our customers, we offer financing by a third-party finance company or through an internal revolving charge credit plan. Sales financed by the third-party provider are not Havertys' receivables; accordingly, we do not have any credit risk or servicing responsibility for these accounts, and there is no credit or collection recourse to Havertys. The most popular programs offered through the third-party provider for 2015 were no interest offers requiring monthly payments over periods of 18 to 36 months. The fees we pay to the third-party are included in SG&#38;A expense. We also maintain a small in-house financing program for our customers with the offer most frequently chosen carrying no interest for 12 months and requiring equal monthly payments. This program generates very minor credit revenue and is for credit worthy customers who prefer financing with the retailer directly or who are not able to quickly establish sufficient credit with other providers on comparable terms.

The following summarizes the different purchasing methods used as a percent of amount due from customers including sales tax:

Stores

As of December 31, 2015, we operated 121 stores serving 82 cities in 16 states with approximately 4.4 million retail square feet. Our stores range in size from 19,000 to 66,000 selling square feet with the average being approximately 35,000 square feet. We strive to have our stores reflect the distinctive style and comfort consumers expect to find when purchasing their home furnishings. The store's curb appeal is important to the type of middle to upper-middle income consumer that we target and our use of classical facades and attractive landscaping complements the quality and style of our merchandise. Interior details are also important for a pleasant and inviting shopping experience. We are very intentional in having open shopping spaces and our disciplined merchandise display ensures uniformity of presentations in-store, online and in our advertising.

We currently are looking within our distribution footprint for available "empty boxes" and new construction opportunities in existing or new markets where our target customers shop. We are also evaluating certain existing stores for expansion, relocation or closure. We expect a net increase of approximately 1.4% in our retail square footage in 2016.

Internet

We know that most consumers use the internet to pre-shop and we strive for havertys.com to be an extension of our stores and brand. Our website features a variety of helpful tools including suggested accessories, upholstery customizations and 3D room planners. We also provide information on which showroom has an item and delivery availability. A large number of product reviews written by our customers is also provided which some consumers find important in the decision making process. Our site allows consumers to develop "wish lists," and to place orders online and set delivery of their purchases. We limit online sales of our furniture to within our delivery network, and accessories to the continental United States. Sales placed through our website are approximately at the level of a single large store and sales increased 5.8% in 2015 compared to 2014 . 

Our sales associates also use havertys.com in the store as a tool to further engage the customer while she is in the store and extend her shopping experience when she returns home. Our site underwent changes in 2015 to have responsive sizing when accessed using mobile devices and provide more interactive opportunities with the customer. We believe that a direct-to-customer business complements our retail store operations by building brand awareness.

Suppliers

We buy our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest ten of which accounted for approximately 56.4 % of our product purchases during 2015. Most of our wood products, or "case goods," are imported from Asia. Upholstered items are largely produced domestically, with the exception of our leather products which are primarily imported from Asia or Mexico.

We purchase our furniture merchandise produced in Asia through sourcing companies and also buy direct from manufacturers. We have developed a growing direct import program which works with industry designers and manufacturers in some of the best factories throughout Asia. We have dedicated quality control specialists on-site during production to ensure the items meet our specifications. Approximately 27.0% of our case goods sales in 2015 were generated by our direct imports.

Supply Chain and Distribution

The longer lead times required for deliveries from overseas factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for Havertys makes it imperative for us to have both warehousing capabilities and effective supply chain control. Our merchandising team provides input to the ordering process in an effort to maintain overall inventory levels within an appropriate range and reduce the amount of written sales awaiting product delivery. We use real-time information to closely follow our import orders from the manufacturing plant through each stage of transit and using this data can more accurately set customer delivery dates prior to receipt of product.

Our distribution system currently uses a combination of three distribution centers (DCs), four home delivery centers (HDCs), and two local market cross-docks. In addition to receiving both domestic product and containers of imported merchandise, the DCs are designed to shuttle prepped merchandise up to 250 miles for next day home deliveries, and serve HDCs and cross-docks within a 500-mile radius. The HDCs provide service to markets within an additional 200 miles. A warehousing management system using radio frequency scanners tracks each piece of inventory in real time and allows for random storage in the warehouse and efficient scheduling and changing of the workflow. Operating standards in our warehouse and delivery functions provide measurements for determining staffing needs and increasing productivity. We use Havertys employees for executing home delivery, and branded this service "Top Drawer Delivery," an important function serving as the last contact with our customers in the purchase process. We believe that our distribution and delivery system is the best in the retail furniture industry and provides us with a significant competitive advantage.

&#160;

Competition

The retail sale of home furnishings is a highly fragmented and competitive business. The degree and sources of competition vary by geographic area. We compete with numerous individual retail furniture stores as well as chains and certain department stores. Department stores benefit competitively from more established name recognition in specific markets, a larger customer base due to their non-furnishings product lines and proprietary credit cards. Mass merchants and some electronics and appliance retailers also have limited furniture product offerings. Furniture manufacturers have also opened their own dedicated retail stores in an effort to control and protect the distribution prospects of their branded merchandise.

We believe Havertys is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, with a targeted mix of merchandise that appeals to customers who are somewhat more affluent than those of competitive price-oriented furniture store chains. Our ability to make prompt delivery of orders through maintenance of inventory, the expansion of our custom order capabilities and the tailoring of merchandise to customers' desires on a local market basis are we believe significant competitive advantages. We believe our online presence provides a seamless omni-channel approach that many of our competitors do not have or can not replicate. We also consider our experienced sales personnel and the addition of in-home designers as important factors in our competitive success.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,596 employees: 2,152 in individual retail store operations, 192 in our corporate and credit operations, 62 in our customer-service call centers, and 1,190 in our warehouse and delivery points. None of our employees is a party to any union contract.

Trademarks and Domain Names

We have registered our various logos, trademarks and service marks. We believe that our trademark position is adequately protected in all markets in which we do business. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names including "havertys.com." Collectively, the trademarks, service marks and domain names that we hold are of material importance to us.
