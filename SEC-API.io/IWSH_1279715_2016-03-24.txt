General Development of Business 

Wright Investors&#8217; Service Holdings, Inc. (formerly National Patent Development Corporation) (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Wright Holdings&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated on March 10, 1998 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GP Strategies Corporation (&#8220;GP Strategies&#8221;) and in November 2004, the Company&#8217;s common stock was spun-off to holders of record of GP Strategies common stock and GP Strategies Class B capital stock. The Company&#8217;s common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and is traded under the symbol &#8220;WISH&#8221;. 

Historically, the Company owned a home improvement distribution business through its then wholly-owned subsidiary Five Star Products, Inc. (&#8220;Five Star Products&#8221;). The Company with a substantial portion of its assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents, also owned, and continues to own, certain non-strategic assets, primarily consisting of certain real estate. (each as described herein). 

On January 15, 2010, we completed the sale (the &#8220;Five Star Sale&#8221;) to The Merit Group, Inc. (&#8220;Merit&#8221;) of all of the issued and outstanding stock (the &#8220;Five Star Stock&#8221;) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Five Star Products, the holding company and sole stockholder of Five Star Group, Inc. (&#8220;Five Star Group&#8221;), for cash pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement between the Company and Merit, dated as of November 24, 2009 (the &#8220;Five Star Stock Purchase Agreement&#8221;). As used herein, references to &#8220;Five Star&#8221; refer to Five Star Products or Five Star Group, or both, as the context requires. 

&#160; 

&#160; Nature of Our Business Following the Five Star Sale 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors is considering strategic uses for the Five Star Sale proceeds including, without limitation, using such funds, together with other funds of the Company, to develop or acquire interests in one or more operating businesses. While we have focused our development or acquisition efforts on sectors in which our management has expertise, we do not wish to limit ourselves to, or to foreclose any opportunities in, any particular industry or sector. 

On December 19, 2012, (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8217;) the Company, completed the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;MergerSub&#8221;) with and into The Winthrop Corporation, a Connecticut corporation (&#8220;Winthrop&#8221;), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) dated June 18, 2012. As more fully described below, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s business operations are carried out through Winthrop and its subsidiaries, the Wright Companies. 

&#160; 

Prior to this use, the Five Star Sale proceeds have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, invested in high-grade, short-term investments (such as cash and cash equivalents) consistent with the preservation of principal, maintenance of liquidity and avoidance of speculation, until such time as we need to utilize such funds, or any portion thereof, for the purposes described above. We have not distributed, and do not anticipate distributing, the proceeds of the Five Star Sale to our stockholders.

Overview 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s assets currently consist of its 100% ownership interest in Winthrop and cash and cash equivalents, which were $8,493,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company intends to use its remaining cash and cash equivalents to acquire interests in one or more operating businesses in the asset management space that it believes will be synergistic with Winthrop and to fund the Company&#8217;s general and administrative expenses. 

&#160; 

On the Closing Date of the Merger, 881,206 shares of Company Common Stock were issued by the Company as Merger Consideration to those holders of Winthrop Common Stock who elected to receive Company Common Stock as Merger Consideration and the Company paid cash totaling $4,852,000 to those holders of Winthrop Common Stock who elected to receive cash as Merger Consideration. Winthrop received and provided to the Company the required consents to Advisory Contracts representing sufficient Winthrop revenues so that no purchase price adjustment occurred in accordance with the Merger Agreement. 

In accordance with the Merger Agreement, on or before July 18, 2012, shareholders of Winthrop holding at least 92% of the outstanding voting power of Winthrop immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the &#8220;Support Agreement Securityholders&#8221;) entered into the Support Agreement pursuant to which such Support Agreement Securityholders agreed to, among other things, indemnify the Company, in proportion to the percentage of the total Merger Consideration received by them, against all losses incurred with respect to or in connection with (i) the failure of any representation or warranty of Winthrop in the Merger Agreement or in other documents delivered pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (collectively, the &#8220;Transaction Documents&#8221;) to be true and correct; (ii) any failure by Winthrop to fully perform, fulfill or comply with any covenant of Winthrop set forth in the Transaction Documents; and (iii) the payment of certain pre-closing taxes.

In addition, the Support Agreement Securityholders are not required to indemnify the Company unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable losses suffered by the Company exceeds $20,000, at which time the Company will be entitled to indemnification for the amount of losses that exceeds such amount. 

&#160; 

As of the Closing Date, the Company entered into the Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement with Peter M. Donovan, Theodore S. Roman, Amit S. Khandwala, and M.

The Investors&#8217; Rights Agreement provides that shares of Company Common Stock received as Merger Consideration will be subject to a three year transfer restriction and, for any such shares held by an employee of the Company who terminates such employment without &#8220;good reason&#8221; prior to the third anniversary of the Closing (December 19, 2015), a call right in favor of the Company at a purchase price per share equal to the fair market value of Company Common Stock as of the date of the notice of the exercise of the call right.

On June 22, 2012, the Board of Trustees of each Winthrop-sponsored mutual fund approved the Management Change for each such fund and on September 13, 2012, the shareholders of each such Winthrop-sponsored mutual fund approved the Management Change for each such fund. In addition, prior to the closing date Winthrop received all other required regulatory approvals, including approval by the Financial Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) relating to the change of control of Winthrop&#8217;s broker-dealer subsidiary. 

The Company owned and continues to own certain non-strategic assets, interests in land and flowage rights in undeveloped property in Killingly, Connecticut. The Company had a 19.9% interest in MXL carried at its cost of $275,000 On February 3, 2014 MXL exercised its right to purchase the Company&#8217;s 19.9% interest. The Company received $994,000 for its 19.9% interest on March 26, 2014, resulting in a gain of $719,000. 

The Company monitors these investments for impairment by considering current factors, including the economic environment, market conditions, operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment, and records impairments in carrying values when necessary.

The Winthrop Business 

Overview 

Winthrop, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Wright Investors&#8217; Service, Inc. (&#8220;Wright&#8221;), Wright Investors&#8217; Service Distributors, Inc. (&#8220;WISDI&#8221;) and Wright&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Wright Private Asset Management, LLC (&#8220;WPAM&#8221;) (collectively, the &#8220;Wright Companies&#8221;), offers investment management services, financial advisory services and investment research to large and small investors, both taxable and tax exempt. For more than 50 years, the Wright Companies have assisted institutions, plan sponsors, bank trust departments, trust companies and individual investors in achieving their financial objectives. The management approach is to invest assets prudently by balancing risk and return. 

Investment Management Services 

At the center of the Wright Companies&#8217; investment process is the Wright Investment Committee. The Committee consists of a select group of senior investment professionals who are supported by an experienced staff. This staff provides multilevel analyses of the economy and investment environments. Their analysis includes a report and projection of corporate earnings and interest rates and an assessment of the impact of the economic forecasts on market sectors, individual securities and client portfolios. 

Wright markets its investment management products and services to plan sponsors, trade unions, endowments, corporations, state and local governments, municipalities and foundations. The Wright products include equity, fixed income and balanced portfolios for various plan types, including defined benefit, annuity, self-directed and 401(k), health and welfare and education and training plans. In addition, Wright helps bank trust departments and trust companies satisfy part or all of their investment management functions. Wright delivers fiduciary level investment management services to these institutions&#8217; clients by providing active oversight of each account's asset allocation and security selection. Its offerings include investment management solutions utilizing individual securities or mutual funds. Mutual fund models developed by Wright utilize a combination of Wright Mutual Funds as well as mutual funds from other investment managers. 

WPAM offers programs to support high net worth investors and other individual investors. WPAM manages a variety of accounts including: discretionary investment accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401k plans and accounts for non-corporate fiduciaries, such as trustees, executors, guardians, personal representatives, attorneys and other professionals who are responsible for the assets of others and must manage those assets in accordance with the Prudent Investor Act. This investment process, developed and monitored by the Wright Investment Committee, and related investment strategies, are utilized to address the objectives of WPAM clients. 

Wright-Managed Mutual Funds 

Wright, through its WISDI affiliate, offers a diversified family of mutual funds. Wright Mutual Funds are utilized by the Wright Companies and others to build or supplement managed investment portfolios designed to address clients&#8217; financial objectives. In December 2014, Wright closed its Total Return Bond Fund. Following is a brief description of the four Wright-managed mutual funds. 

Wright Major Blue Chip Fund (WQCEX ). The fund invests primarily in larger companies on the Approved Wright Investment List (&#8220;AWIL&#8221;) which meet or exceed the fundamental standards of investment quality established by Wright, or are leaders in their industry, and which have a superior investment outlook. The fund&#8217;s investment objective is long-term total return consisting of price appreciation plus income. The fund&#8217;s benchmark is the S&#38;P 500 index.

&#160;

Wright Selected Blue Chip Fund (WSBEX). The fund invests primarily in mid-cap companies on AWIL which meet or exceed the fundamental standards of investment quality established by Wright, or are leaders in their industry, and which have a superior investment outlook. The fund&#8217;s investment objective is long-term total return consisting of price appreciation plus income. The fund&#8217;s benchmark is the S&#38;P 400 index. 

Wright International Blue Chip Equities Fund (WIBCX). The fund invests in well-established non-U.S. companies that meet strict quality standards. The fund may purchase equity securities traded on foreign exchanges or traded in the U.S. through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). The fund&#8217;s investment objective is long-term total return consisting of price appreciation plus income. The fund&#8217;s benchmark is the MSCI Developed World ex-U.S. Index. 

Wright Current Income Fund (WCIFX). The fund invests in mortgage pass-through securities of the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and may invest in other debt obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies. The fund&#8217;s investment objective is a high level of current income consistent with moderate fluctuations of principle. The fund&#8217;s benchmark is the Barclay&#8217;s GNMA index.

Competition 

The investment advisory, investment management and investment research industries are highly competitive. There are few barriers to entry for new firms, and consolidation within the industry continues to alter the competitive landscape. We continuously encounter competitors in the marketplace who offer similar investment strategies and services. Although no one company dominates the asset management industry, many companies are larger, better known and have greater resources than we do. We compete with a large number of global and U.S. investment advisers, commercial banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors offer more investment strategies and services than we do and have substantially greater assets under management. 

We compete primarily on the basis of investment philosophy, investment performance, range of investment strategies and features, reputation, quality of client service, fees charged, the level and type of compensation offered to key employees, and the manner in which investment strategies are marketed. We believe that our investment style, investment strategies, and distribution channels enable us to compete effectively in our industry. While we believe we will continue to be successful in growing our assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;), it may be necessary to expend additional resources to compete effectively. Our competitive success will depend upon our ability to develop and market investment strategies, adopt or develop new technologies, and continue to expand our relationships with existing clients and attract new clients. Our ability to compete also depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees while managing our compensation and other costs. 

Customers 

Our investment advisory client base consists of a large number of geographically diverse clients across many industries. We provide investment management services to a broad range of clients, including mutual funds, retirement plans, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, financial institutions and high net worth individuals. We strive to expand our client base by attracting new clients and earning additional business from our existing clients. As of December 31, 2015, no single client&#8217;s assets managed by us represented more than 10% of our AUM. 

Our client base for research services consists of individuals and companies who access our reports through various distributors or through our own website, www.corporateinformation.com. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 75% of our research revenue has been derived from Thomson Reuters. 

&#160; Intellectual Property 

We maintain a number of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Our trademarks relate to our company names and certain products we provide and expire at various dates ranging from 2016 to 2020. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single trademark, copyright, trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to our business as a whole. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

Our business is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event the adviser fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. 

Each of Winthrop, Wright and WPAM is registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). As SEC registered investment advisers, Winthrop, Wright and WPAM are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;), the SEC&#8217;s regulations thereunder, and examination by the SEC. Requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, engaging in transactions with clients, disclosure obligations, record keeping and reporting obligations, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Moreover, in Wright&#8217;s role as the investment advisor to mutual funds, Wright is subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), the SEC&#8217;s regulations thereunder, and examination by the SEC. The Investment Company Act regulates the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser and imposes obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both the funds and their advisers, which are in addition to those imposed by the Investment Advisers Act. Additionally, an investment adviser&#8217;s advisory agreement with a registered fund may be terminated by the fund on not more than 60 days&#8217; notice, and is subject to renewal annually by the fund&#8217;s board after an initial two-year term. 

Under the Investment Advisers Act, investment advisory agreements may not be assigned without the client&#8217;s consent. Under the Investment Company Act, investment advisory agreements with registered funds, such as the funds that Wright advises, terminate automatically upon assignment. The term &#8220;assignment&#8221; is broadly defined and includes direct assignment as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a controlling interest in Wright. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. The failure of the Wright Companies, or the registered funds for which Wright serves as the investment adviser, to comply with the requirements of the SEC could have a material adverse effect on us. 

To the extent that any of the Wright Companies is a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under the Employment Retirement Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) with respect to benefit plan clients, it is subject to the requirements of ERISA, and to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor thereunder. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221;), impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our subsidiary, WISDI is registered as a broker/dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. As a registered broker/dealer, WISDI is subject to the regulation by the SEC. However, much of the regulation of broker/dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, primarily FINRA. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern their members and conduct periodic examinations of member firms&#8217; operations. Broker/dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered. 

Our trading activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of trading requirements (e.g., volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and abroad. 

&#160; 

The preceding descriptions of the regulatory and statutory provisions applicable to us are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to their respective statutory or regulatory provisions.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Regulatory Reform 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;DFA&#8221;) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The ultimate adoption of these regulations and decisions will determine the impact of the DFA on us. It is difficult to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon our business and results of operations. The DFA and its regulations, other new laws or regulations, changes in rules promulgated by either the SEC or federal and state regulatory authorities or self-regulatory bodies, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability or our business. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, Winthrop employed 28 full-time employees, including 10 investment management, research and trading professionals, 11 marketing and client service professionals and 7 operations and business management professionals. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. 

The Company employed a total of 4 employees at the corporate level as of December 31, 2015, of which all were full-time employees. 

MXL Operations 

The Company operated a molder and precision coater of optical plastics business through its wholly-owned subsidiary MXL Industries until June 19, 2008, when MXL Industries disposed of substantially all of its assets and transferred certain liabilities and on the same date the Company purchased an interest of 19.9% in the business that was sold. The disposed operations specialize in manufacturing polycarbonate parts requiring adherence to strict optical quality specifications, and in the application of abrasion and fog resistant coatings to those parts. 

On February 3, 2014 MXL exercised its right to purchase the Company&#8217;s 19.9% interest. The Company received $994,000 for its 19.9% interest on March 26, 2014, resulting in a gain of $719,000. 

Connecticut Property 

The Company has interests in land and certain flowage rights in undeveloped property in Killingly, Connecticut with a carrying value of approximately $355,000 which is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and, which management believes is less than fair value.
