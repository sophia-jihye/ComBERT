General 

&#160; 

Natural Grocers is an expanding specialty retailer of natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements. We focus on providing high-quality products at affordable prices, exceptional customer service, nutrition education and community outreach. We strive to generate long-term relationships with our customers based on transparency and trust by: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

selling only natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements that meet our strict quality guidelines - we do not approve for sale grocery products that are known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

utilizing an efficient and flexible smaller-store format to offer affordable prices and a shopper-friendly retail environment; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

enhancing our customers&#8217; shopping experience by providing free science-based nutrition education to help our customers make well-informed health and nutrition choices. 

&#160; 

Our History and Founding Principles 

&#160; 

Our founders, Margaret and Philip Isely, were early proponents of the connection between health and the use of natural and organic products and dietary supplements. In the mid-1950&#8217;s, Margaret transformed her health and the health of her family by applying concepts and principles she learned from books on nutrition. This inspired the Iselys to provide the same type of nutrition education to their community. The Iselys started by lending books on nutrition and providing samples of whole grain bread door-to-door in Golden, Colorado and subsequently concluded they could develop a viable business that would also improve their customers&#8217; well-being. Over time, they fostered relationships through nutrition education and began taking orders for dietary supplements, whole grain bread and unprocessed foods. As their customers gained more knowledge about nutrition, they were empowered to make changes to their diets with the objective of supporting their health. Using this model as the foundation for their business, the Iselys opened their first store in 1958, which they later moved to a modest cottage. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We are committed to maintaining the following founding principles, which have helped foster our growth: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Nutrition Education. We provide nutrition education in the communities we serve. Empowering our customers and our employees to take charge of their lives and their health is the foundation upon which our business is built. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Quality. Every product on our shelves must go through a rigorous screening and approval process. Our mission includes providing the highest quality groceries and supplements, Natural Grocers branded products and only United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic, fresh produce at the best prices in the industry. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

EDAP - Every Day Affordable Price &#174; . We work hard to secure the best possible prices on all of our customers&#8217; favorite natural and organic foods and supplements. We believe everyone should be able to afford to help take care of their health by buying high quality competitively priced natural and organic products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Community. From free nutrition education lectures, to bag-free checkouts, to sourcing local products, to our donation program, we work hard to serve the communities that help shape our world. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Employees. Our employees make our company great. We work hard to ensure that our employees are able to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle. We support them with free nutrition education programs, good pay and excellent benefits. 

&#160; 

In 1998, the second generation of the Isely family, including Kemper Isely, Zephyr Isely, Heather Isely and Elizabeth Isely, purchased our predecessor and the Vitamin Cottage &#174; trademark and assumed control of the business. Since then, we have grown our store count from 11 stores in Colorado to 126 stores in 19 states as of September 30, 2016. We have also implemented numerous organizational and operational improvements that have enhanced our ability to scale our operations. We believe that by staying true to our founding principles, we have been able to continue to attract new customers, extend our geographic reach and further solidify our competitive position. 

&#160; 

Our Markets 

&#160; 

We operate within the natural products retail industry, which is a subset of the United States grocery industry and the dietary supplement business. This industry includes conventional supermarkets, natural, gourmet and specialty food markets, mass and discount retailers, warehouse clubs, independent health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers&#8217; markets, food co-ops, online retailers and multi-level marketers. Industry-wide sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements have experienced meaningful growth over the past several years, and we believe that growth will continue for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods and dietary supplements continues to be driven by numerous factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

greater consumer focus on high-quality nutritional products; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

an increased awareness of the importance of good nutrition to long-term wellness; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

an aging United States population seeking to support healthy aging; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

heightened consumer awareness about the importance of food quality and a desire to avoid pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and genetically engineered ingredients in foods; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

growing consumer concerns over the use of harmful chemical additives in body care and household cleaning supplies; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

well-established natural and organic brands, which generate additional industry awareness and credibility with consumers; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the growth in the number of consumers with unique dietary requirements as a result of allergies, chemical sensitivities, auto-immune disorders and other conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on favorable natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industry dynamics as a result of the following competitive strengths: 

&#160; 

Strict focus on high-quality natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. We offer high-quality products and brands, including an extensive selection of widely-recognized natural and organic food, dietary supplements, body care products, pet care products and books. We offer our customers an average of approximately 21,100 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) of natural and organic products per comparable store (stores open for 13 months or longer), including an average of approximately 6,500 SKUs of dietary supplements. We believe our broad product offering enables our customers to shop our stores for substantially all of their grocery and dietary supplement purchases. In our grocery departments, we only sell USDA certified organic produce and do not approve for sale grocery products that are known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. In addition, we only sell pasture-raised, non-confinement dairy products and free-range eggs. Consistent with this strategy, our product selection does not include items that do not meet our strict quality guidelines. Our store managers enhance our robust product offering by customizing their stores&#8217; selections to address the preferences of local customers. All products undergo a stringent review process to ensure the products we sell meet our strict quality guidelines, which we believe helps us generate long-term relationships with our customers based on transparency and trust. 

&#160; 

Engaging customer service experience based on education and empowerment. We strive to offer consistently exceptional customer service in a shopper-friendly environment, which we believe creates a differentiated shopping experience, enhances customer loyalty and generates repeat visits from our clientele. A key aspect of our customer service model is to provide free nutrition education to our customers. We believe this focus provides an engaging retail experience while also empowering our customers to make informed decisions about their health. We offer our science-based nutrition education through our trained employees, our Health Hotline &#174; newsletter and sales flyer, community out-reach programs, one-on-one nutrition health coaching, nutrition classes, cooking demonstrations, and our website. Our commitment to nutrition education and customer empowerment is emphasized throughout our entire organization, from executive management to store employees. Every store also maintains a Nutritional Health Coach, or NHC, position. The NHC is responsible for training our store employees and educating our customers about nutrition in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Each NHC must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition, and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. Substantially all of our NHCs are full-time employees. We believe our NHC position represents a key element of our customer service model. 

&#160; 

Scalable operations and replicable, cost-effective store model. We believe our scalable operating structure, attractive new store model, flexible real estate strategy and disciplined approach to new store development allow us to maximize store performance and continue to grow our store base. Our store model has been successful in highly competitive markets and has supported significant growth outside of our original Colorado geography. We believe our supply chain and infrastructure are scalable and will accommodate significant growth based on the ability of our primary distribution relationships to effectively service our planned store locations. Our investments in overhead and information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems, support this growth. We also have a comprehensive human resources information and learning management system (HRIS) to further support the scalability of our operations. In addition, we have established effective site selection guidelines, as well as scalable procedures, to enable us to open a new store within approximately nine months from the time of lease execution. The smaller-store footprint made possible by our limited offering of prepared foods reduces real estate costs, labor costs and perishable inventory shrink and allows us to leverage our new store opening costs. 

&#160; 

Experienced and committed management team with proven track record. Our executive management team has an average of 38 years of experience in the natural grocery industry, while our entire management team has an average of over 30 years of relevant experience. Since the second generation of the Isely family assumed control of the business in 1998, we have grown our store count from 11 stores to 126 stores as of September 30, 2016 by remaining dedicated to our founding principles. Over their tenure, members of our executive management team have been instrumental in establishing a successful, scalable operating model, generating consistently strong financial results and developing an effective site selection and store opening process. The depth of our management experience extends beyond our home office. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 48.0% of our store managers at comparable stores had tenures of over four years with us, and our store and department managers at these stores had average tenures of over three years with us. In addition, we have a track record of promoting store management personnel from within. We believe our management&#8217;s experience at all levels will allow us to continue to grow our store base while maintaining operational excellence by driving efficiencies in store and back room operations, managing inventory levels and focusing on exceptional customer service. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

We are pursuing several strategies to continue our profitable growth, including: 

&#160; 

Expand our store base. We intend to continue expanding our store base through new store openings in existing markets, as well as penetrating new markets, by leveraging our core competencies of site selection and efficient store openings. Based upon our operating experience and research conducted for us by The Buxton Company, a customer analytics firm, we believe the entire United States market can support over 1,100 Natural Grocers stores, including approximately 200 additional Natural Grocers stores in the 19 states in which we currently operate or have signed leases. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we opened 23 and 16 new stores, respectively, and we plan to open 15 to 20 new stores in fiscal year 2017, of which three opened during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 prior to the filing of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Current store locations , signed lease s and new store location s. 

&#160; &#160;

*Includes signed leases for stores to be opened subsequent to fiscal year 2016. Between September 30, 2016 and the date of this Form 10-K, we opened three new stores. Additionally, we have 18 signed leases for stores planned to open in fiscal year 2017 and 2018. 

&#160; 

Increase sales from existing customers. We have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for over 57 consecutive quarters. In order to increase our average ticket and the number of customer transactions, we plan to continue offering an engaging customer experience by providing science-based nutrition education and a differentiated merchandising strategy that delivers affordable, high-quality natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. We also plan to continue to utilize targeted marketing efforts to reach our existing customers, which we anticipate will drive customer transactions and convert occasional, single-category customers into core, multi-category customers. 

&#160; 

Grow our customer base. We plan to continue building our brand awareness, which we anticipate will grow our customer base. During fiscal year 2016, we implemented several measures aimed at enhancing our brand awareness, including: (i) increasing the Company&#8217;s presence on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms; (ii) organizing special monthly promotions and events, such as Earth Day in April, on the anniversary of the Company&#8217;s founding in August and during the entire month of September to coincide with National Organic Harvest Month; (iii) conducting outdoor advertising campaigns in select markets; (iv) entering into sponsorship arrangements with a US speed skater and a health and fitness expert; (v) teaming with a Grammy Music Educator Award-nominated musician to produce original Natural Grocers organic-themed songs and music videos; (vi) extending home delivery services to select additional markets; and (vii) developing new collateral marketing materials. We believe offering nutrition education has historically been one of our most effective marketing strategies for reaching new customers and increasing the demand for natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in our markets. To maximize the impact of our Nutritional Health Coaches, we have increased their focus on relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers, including promotions and additional educational cooking events, lectures and classes in our stores. Additionally, we seek to attract new customers by enhancing their nutrition knowledge through printed and digital versions of our broad range of educational resources, including the distribution of our Health Hotline newsletter and sales flyer, and via the internet and social media. In addition to offering nutrition education, our strategy is to attract new customers with our EDAP - Every Day Affordable Price and to build community awareness through our support of local vendors and charities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Improve operating margins. We expect to continue our focus on improving our operating margins as we benefit from investments we have made or are making in fixed overhead and information technology. We anticipate these investments will support our long-term growth strategy with only a modest amount of additional capital. We expect to achieve greater economies of scale through sourcing and distribution as we add more stores. In addition, to achieve additional operating margin expansion, we intend to further optimize performance, maintain appropriate store labor levels, reduce inventory shrink and effectively manage product selection and pricing. 

&#160; 

Our Stores 

&#160; 

Our stores offer a comprehensive selection of natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in a smaller-store format that aims to provide a convenient, easily shopped and relaxed environment for our customers. Our store design emphasizes a clutter-free, organized feel, a quiet ambience accented with warm lighting and the absence of aromas from meat and seafood counters present in many of our competitors&#8217; stores. We believe our core customers consider us a destination stop for their nutritional education and information, natural and organic products and dietary supplements. 

&#160; 

Our Store Format. Our stores range from approximately 5,000 to 16,000 selling square feet, and average approximately 11,000 selling square feet. In fiscal year 2016, our 23 new stores averaged approximately 11,000 selling square feet. Approximately one quarter of our stores&#8217; selling square footage is dedicated to dietary supplements. Some of our stores also include a dedicated community room available for public gatherings, a demonstration kitchen for cooking education and/or lecture space. Our comparable stores sell an average of approximately 21,100 SKUs of natural and organic products per store, including an average of approximately 6,500 SKUs of dietary supplements. 

&#160; 

The following diagram depicts a typical new store layout: 

&#160;

Site Selection. Our real estate strategy is adaptable to a variety of market conditions. When selecting locations for new stores, we use analytical models, based on research provided by The Buxton Company and Forum Analytics, LLC and our extensive experience, to identify promising store locations. We typically locate new stores in prime locations which offer easy customer access and high visibility. Many of our stores are near other supermarkets or gourmet food retailers, and we complement their conventional product offerings with high-quality, affordable natural and organic groceries and dietary supplements in an efficient and convenient retail setting. Our model for selecting viable new store locations incorporates factors such as target demographics, community characteristics, nearby retail activity and other measures and is based on first-hand observation of the community&#8217;s characteristics surrounding each site. We have teams of employees dedicated to opening new stores efficiently and quickly, typically within approximately nine months from the time of lease execution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Store - Level Economics. Since January 1, 2005, opening new stores has required an average upfront capital investment of approximately $2.1 million. We anticipate that our fiscal year 2017 new stores will require an average upfront capital investment of approximately $2.2 million, consisting of capital expenditures of approximately $1.6 million, net of tenant allowances, initial inventory of approximately $0.3 million, net of payables, and pre-opening expenses of approximately $0.3 million. We target approximately four years to recoup our initial net cash investments and approximately 30% cash-on-cash returns by the end of the fifth year following the opening. 

&#160; 

Individual new store investment levels and the performance of new store locations may differ widely from originally targeted levels and from store-to-store due to competitive considerations and a variety of other factors, and these differences may be material. In particular, investments in individual stores, store-level sales, profit margins, payback periods and cash-on-cash return levels are impacted by a range of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including those described under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our Focus on Nutrition Education 

&#160; 

Nutrition education is one of our founding principles and is a primary focus for all employees. We believe our emphasis on science-based nutrition education differentiates us from our competitors and creates a unique shopping experience for our customers. 

&#160; 

Our Nutritional Health Coaches, or NHCs, are a core element of our nutrition education program. Every store has a full-time NHC position to educate customers and train employees on nutrition. NHCs must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition, and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. To educate and empower customers to make informed nutrition choices, our NHCs are available for complimentary one-on-one nutrition health coaching sessions. Each NHC is also responsible for various relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers, including educational activities such as nutrition classes, lectures, seminars, health fairs and store tours. To maximize the impact of our NHCs, we have increased their focus on hosting cooking events (at our stores with demonstration kitchens) and have increased the number of in-store educational events they conduct. We believe that our NHCs&#8217; focus on relationship-building opportunities in our communities and with our customers helps to enhance our marketing and branding initiatives. Additionally, our NHCs are an onsite resource for nutrition training and education for our employees. Each NHC trains our employees to use a compliant educational approach to customer service without attempting to diagnose or treat specific conditions or ailments. We believe our NHC position is a competitive differentiator and represents a key element of our customer service model. 

&#160; 

Our training and education programs are supplemented by outside experts, online materials and printed handouts. We also use our Health Hotline to educate our customers. The Health Hotline is a newsletter and sales flyer which was published ten times in fiscal year 2016. Each issue of the Health Hotline includes in-depth articles on health and nutrition, along with a selection of sale items. The Health Hotline is also distributed via the internet and social media. Consistent with our strategy to shift a greater portion of our marketing efforts from print to digital, the printed Health Hotline newsletter is scheduled to be published seven times in fiscal year 2017. During fiscal year 2015, we redesigned the www.naturalgrocers.com website to enhance functionality and create a more engaging user experience, including readily accessible additional nutritional education information and resources. 

&#160; 

Our Products&#160; 

&#160; 

Product Selection Guidelines. We have a set of strict quality guidelines covering all products we sell. For example: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

we do not approve for sale food known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils, regardless of the proportion of its natural or organic ingredients; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

we only sell USDA certified organic produce; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

we only sell pasture-raised, non-confinement dairy products and free-range eggs; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

we only sell meats naturally raised without hormones, antibiotics or treatments and that were not fed animal by-products; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

we do not sell wine, beer, liquor or tobacco. 

&#160; 

Our product review team analyzes all new products and approves them for sale based on ingredients, price and uniqueness within the current product set. We actively research new products in the marketplace through our product vendors, private label manufacturers, scientific findings, customer requests and general trends in popular media. Our stores are able to fully merchandise all departments by providing an extensive assortment of natural and organic products. We do not believe we need to sell conventional products to fill our selection, increase our margins or attract more customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

What We Sell. We operate both a full-service natural and organic grocery store and a dietary supplement store within a single retail location. The following is a breakdown of our sales mix for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

The products in our stores include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Grocery. We offer a broad selection of natural and organic grocery products with an emphasis on minimally processed and single ingredient products that are not known to contain artificial colors, flavors, preservatives or sweeteners or partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils. Additionally, we carry a wide variety of products associated with special diets such as gluten free, vegetarian and non-dairy. Our grocery products include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; Produce. We sell only USDA certified organic produce and source from local, organic producers whenever feasible. Our selection varies based on seasonal availability, and we strive to offer a variety of organic produce offerings that are not typically found at conventional food retailers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Bulk Food and Private Label Products. We sell a wide selection of private label repackaged bulk and other products, including nuts, water, pasta, canned seafood, dried fruits, grains, granolas, honey, eggs, herbs, spices and teas. We also sell peanut and almond butters, freshly ground in-store under the Natural Grocers brand. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Dry, Frozen and Canned Groceries. We offer a wide variety of natural and organic dry, frozen and canned groceries, including cereals, soups, baby foods, frozen entrees and snack items. We offer a broad selection of natural chocolate bars and energy, protein and food bars. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Meats and Seafood. We only offer naturally-raised or organic meat products. The meat products we offer come from animals that are not known to have been treated with antibiotics or hormones or fed animal by-products. Additionally, we only buy from companies we believe employ humane animal-raising practices. Our seafood items are generally frozen at the time of processing and sold from our freezer section, thereby ensuring freshness and reducing food spoilage and safety issues. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Dairy Products , Dairy Substitutes and Eggs . We offer a broad selection of natural and organic dairy products such as milk, cheeses, yogurts and beverages, as well as eggs and non-dairy substitutes made from almonds, coconuts, rice and soy. During fiscal year 2015, we began to sell only pasture-raised, non-confinement dairy products at all our stores. During fiscal year 2016, we began to sell only free-range eggs (from chickens that are not only cage-free but also provided with sufficient space to move) at all our stores. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Prepared Foods. Our stores have a convenient selection of refrigerated prepared fresh food items, including salads, sandwiches, salsa, humus and wraps. The size of this offering varies by location. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Bread and Baked Goods. We receive regular deliveries of a wide selection of bakery products for our bakery section, which includes an extensive selection of gluten-free items. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Beverages. We offer a wide variety of beverages containing natural and organic ingredients. We also offer low-cost, self-serve filtered drinking water that is dispensed into one-gallon or larger containers provided by our customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Dietary Supplements. Our dietary supplement department primarily sells name-brand supplements, as well as a line of private label dietary supplements. The department is carefully organized to help both employees and customers find products efficiently. We generally offer several different formulations and potencies for each type of product in order to meet our customers&#8217; varying needs. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Other. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Body Care. We offer a full range of cosmetics, skin care, hair care, fragrance and personal care products containing natural and organic ingredients. Our body care offerings range from bargain-priced basics to high-end formulations. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Pet Care. We offer a full line of natural pet care and food products that comply with our human food guidelines. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Household and General Merchandise. Our offerings include sustainable, hypo-allergenic and fragrance-free household products, including cleaning supplies, paper products, dish and laundry soap and other common household products, including diapers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Books and Handouts. We stock approximately 400 titles in each store&#8217;s book department. Titles cover various approaches to diet, lifestyle and health. Additionally, we offer hundreds of handouts on various health topics and dietary supplements to our customers free of charge. 

&#160; 

Quality Assurance. We endeavor to ensure the quality of the products we sell. We work with reputable suppliers we believe are compliant with established regulatory and industry guidelines. Our purchasing department requires a complete supplier and product profile as part of the approval process. Our dietary supplement suppliers must follow Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current good manufacturing practices supported by quality assurance testing for both the base ingredients and the finished product. We expect our suppliers to comply with industry best practices for food safety. 

&#160; 

Many of our suppliers are inspected and certified under the USDA National Organic Program, voluntary industry associations, and other third party auditing programs with regard to additional ingredients, manufacturing and handling standards. Each Natural Grocers store is certified as an organic handler and processor by an accredited USDA certifier in the calendar year after it opens, and annually thereafter. We operate all our stores in compliance with the National Organic Program standards, which restricts the use of certain substances for cleaning and pest control and requires rigorous recordkeeping, among other requirements. 

&#160; 

Our Pricing Strategy 

&#160; 

We have an EDAP - Every Day Affordable Price designation on many products, while also providing special sale pricing on hundreds of additional items. We believe our pricing strategy allows our customers to shop our stores on a regular basis for their groceries and dietary supplements. 

&#160; 

The key elements of our pricing strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

EDAP - Every Day Affordable Price throughout our stores; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

heavily advertised Health Hotline deals supported by manufacturer participation; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

in-store specials generally lasting for one month and not advertised outside the store; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

managers&#8217; specials, such as clearance, overstock, short-dated or promotional incentives; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

specials on seasonally harvested produce. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As we continue to expand our store base, we believe there are opportunities for increased leverage in fixed costs, such as administrative expenses, as well as increased economies of scale in sourcing products. We strive to keep our product, operating and general and administrative costs low, which allows us to continue to offer attractive pricing for our customers. 

&#160; 

Our Store Operations 

&#160; 

Store Hours. Our stores typically are open from 8:00 a.m. to 9:04 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and from 8:00 a.m. to 7:35 p.m. on Sunday. 

&#160; 

Store Management and Staffing. Our typical store staffing includes a manager and assistant manager, with department managers in each of the dietary supplement, grocery, dairy and frozen, produce, body care and receiving departments, as well as several non-management employees. Each store manager is responsible for monthly store profit and loss, including labor, merchandising and inventory costs. We also employ regional managers to oversee all store operations for regions consisting of approximately 13 to 15 stores. Each regional manager reports to, and is supported by, a director of store operations. 

&#160; 

To ensure a high level of service, all employees receive training and guidance on customer service skills, product attributes and nutrition education. Employees are carefully trained and evaluated based on a requirement that they present nutrition information in an appropriate and legally compliant educational context while interacting with customers. Additionally, store employees are cross-trained in various functions, including cashier duties, stocking and receiving product. 

&#160; 

Every store also maintains a Nutritional Health Coach, or NHC, position. The NHC is responsible for training our store employees and educating our customers in accordance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. Each NHC must have earned a degree or certificate in nutrition or a related field from an accredited school, complete continuing education in nutrition and be thoroughly committed to fulfilling our mission. Substantially all of our NHCs are full-time employees. The NHCs are overseen by Regional Nutritional Health Coach Managers. 

&#160; 

Bulk Food Repackaging Facility and Distribution Center. We lease a 150,000 square foot bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center located in Golden, Colorado. That facility also houses a training center and certain administrative support functions. 

&#160; 

Inventory. We use a robust merchandise management and perpetual inventory system that values goods at moving average cost. We manage shelf stock based on weeks-on-hand relative to sales, resupply time and minimum economic order quantity. 

&#160; 

Sourcing and Vendors. We source from approximately 1,200 suppliers, and offer over 3,100 brands. These suppliers range from small independent businesses to multi-national conglomerates. As of September 30, 2016, we purchased approximately 80% of the goods we sell from our top 20 suppliers. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, approximately 59% of our total purchases were from United Natural Foods Inc. and its subsidiaries (UNFI). In fiscal year 2016, we extended our long-term relationship with UNFI as our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products through May 31, 2021. We maintain good relations with UNFI and believe we have adequate alternative supply methods, including self-distribution. 

&#160; 

We contract with third-party manufacturers to produce groceries and dietary supplements under our private labels, which include the Natural Grocers and Vitamin Cottage brands. We have longstanding relationships with our suppliers, and we require disclosure from them regarding quality, freshness, potency and safety data information. Our bulk food private label products are packaged by us in pre-packed sealed bags to help prevent contamination while in transit and in our stores. Unlike most of our competitors, most of our private label nuts, trail mix and flours are refrigerated in our warehouse and stores to maintain freshness. 

&#160; 

Our Employees 

&#160; 

Commitment to our employees is one of our five founding principles. Employees are eligible for health, long-term disability, vision and dental insurance coverage, as well as Company paid short-term disability and life insurance benefits, after they meet eligibility requirements. Additionally, our employees are offered a 401(k) retirement savings plan with discretionary contribution matching opportunities. We believe we pay above average retail wages, and all employees earn an additional $1.00 per hour, up to $40 per week, in &#8220;Vitamin Bucks&#8221; which can be used to purchase products in our stores. It is important to us that our employees live a healthy, balanced lifestyle, and we believe the Vitamin Bucks incentive provides an additional resource for our employees to purchase natural and organic products. This further offers our employees the opportunity to become more familiar with the products we sell, which we believe improves the customer service our employees are able to provide. We believe these and other factors result in higher retention rates and encourage our employees to appreciate our culture, which helps them better promote our brand. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

All employees are eligible to participate in our discretionary pay-for-performance incentive compensation plan after meeting certain length of service requirements. The pay-for-performance incentive compensation plan sets certain Company-level financial goals that must be met before it can be funded. If the financial goals are achieved, additional criteria for store-level incentive compensation include meeting sales projections, sales to labor hour goals and cost of goods sold metrics. We believe these criteria help align all store employees with both corporate and store-level financial goals. We have an established set of standard operating procedures, including hiring and human resource policies, training practices and operational instruction manuals. This allows each store to operate with strict accountability and still maintain independence to respond to its unique circumstances. 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016, we employed 2,651 full-time and 423 part-time (less than 30 hours per week) employees, including a total of 278 employees at our home office and our bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

The growth in the natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement industries and growing consumer interest in health and nutrition have led to an increase in our core customer base. We believe the demands for affordable, nutritious food and dietary supplements are shared attributes of our core customers, regardless of their socio-economic status. Additionally, we believe our core customers prefer a retail store environment that offers carefully selected natural and organic products and dietary supplements. Our customers tend to be interested in health and nutrition, and expect our store employees to be highly knowledgeable about these topics and related products. 

&#160; 

An analysis of our Health Hotline subscriber list indicates that our customers come from broad geographic segments, including urban, suburban and rural areas, which reflects the varied characteristics and portability of our store locations. 

&#160; 

Our Communities 

&#160; 

One of our founding principles is to be an active member and steward of the communities we serve. As a commitment to this principle, we: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

provide extensive free educational services to customers in the form of lectures, classes, printed resources, online resources, publications and one-on-one nutrition coaching; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

manage the waste stream services at all of our stores in order to optimize our diversion of waste to recycling and compost and increase the environmental sustainability of our operations; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our marketing efforts is focused on educating our customers on the benefits of natural and organic grocery products and dietary supplements. Our customer outreach programs provide practical general nutrition knowledge to a variety of groups and individuals, schools, businesses, families and seniors. These educational efforts fulfill one of our founding principles and also offer us the opportunity to build relationships with customers and community influencers. 

&#160; 

Health Hotline. Our Health Hotline is a 20-page newsletter and sales flyer which contains a mix of in-depth health and nutrition articles, along with a selection of popular sale items. The articles aim to be relevant, science-based and written to reflect the most recent research findings. In fiscal year 2016, the full version of the Health Hotline was published ten times and mailed to subscribers and distributed in our stores. In fiscal year 2016, a condensed version of the Health Hotline , which typically emphasizes only one article or topic, was inserted into the newspaper in many of our communities approximately 34 times. In addition, an electronic version of the condensed Health Hotline was distributed to subscribers in fiscal year 2016. Consistent with our strategy to shift a greater portion of our marketing efforts from print to digital, we expect to publish the printed Health Hotline newsletter seven times and the condensed Health Hotline 17 times in fiscal year 2017. Generally, we negotiate with our suppliers for significantly lower costs on Health Hotline sale items, which in turn allows us to offer low sale prices to our customers. Focused staff training at all locations occurs concurrently with the release of each Health Hotline to ensure that store staff are familiar with the content in each issue. 

&#160; 

Web Sites and Social Media. We maintain www.naturalgrocers.com as our official company website to host store information, sales flyers, educational materials, product information, policies and contact forms, advocacy and news items and e-commerce activities. We redesigned our website in fiscal year 2015 to enhance functionality, create a more engaging user experience and increase its reach and effectiveness. The website redesign was intended to be part of an overall enhanced branding strategy to more effectively communicate our brand&#8217;s unique and compelling attributes, including our founding principles. We believe the continued growth of site visitors, page views and other metrics of our website activity indicates that our content is timely and informative to the communities we serve. Our website is interlinked with other online and social media outlets, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube. During fiscal year 2016, we created an individual Facebook page for each of our stores. We expect to increase such digital engagement activities during fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

{N} P ower &#174; Customer Appreciation Program. During fiscal year 2015, we completed the introduction of the {N}Power customer appreciation program at all our stores. We believe {N}Power has enhanced customer loyalty and increased customer engagement levels. Registered users of {N}Power receive digital coupons, personalized offers and other rewards, all by providing their phone number at the time of checkout. 

&#160; 

Special Promotions. During fiscal year 2016, we organized special monthly promotions and events, such as Earth Day in April, on the anniversary of the Company&#8217;s founding in August and during the entire month of September to coincide with National Organic Harvest Month. Promotions included contests in connection with &#8220;good4u&#8221; nutrition challenges and nutrition education classes. We expect to continue offering similar promotions and special events in the future. 

&#160; 

Sponsorships. During fiscal year 2016, we entered into sponsorship arrangements with a US speed skater and a health and fitness expert. Under these arrangements, the sponsored individuals attend &#8220;meet and greet&#8221; events at our stores, contribute articles to the Health Hotline newsletter and sales flyer, share recipes and fitness tips on our website and participate in social media and other promotional activities on our behalf. 

&#160; 

Original Music. During fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement with a Grammy Music Educator Award-nominated musician to produce original organic-themed songs and music videos for us. Under this agreement, the musician also performed at new store openings and participated in social media and other promotional activities during fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

Home Delivery Services . We offer home delivery services in select markets in partnership with a third party. We currently provide home delivery services in the Portland, Oregon and Denver and Boulder, Colorado markets. 

&#160; 

Other Marketing Activities. During fiscal year 2016, we implemented an outdoor advertising campaign in five markets. In addition, we occasionally use television and radio advertising as part of our marketing activities. 

&#160; 

New Store Openings . We use various targeted marketing efforts to support the successful introduction of our new stores in their individual markets. In addition to the distribution of our Health Hotline newsletter and Internet and social media efforts targeted to the region, we utilize direct mail distribution of a series of introductory postcards promoting our brand and providing discounts and other incentives for new customers. We also focus on community relationship-building activities, including a series of lectures and cooking and other demonstrations in each new store&#8217;s community room and/or demonstration kitchen. Other new store promotional activities include gift card giveaways, musical performances, appearances by our sponsorship partners and participation by local community leaders and organizations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The grocery and dietary supplement retail business is a large, fragmented and highly competitive industry, with few barriers to entry. Our competition varies by market and includes conventional supermarkets such as Kroger and Safeway, mass or discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, natural and gourmet markets such as Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, specialty food retailers such as Sprouts and Trader Joe&#8217;s, warehouse clubs such as Sam&#8217;s Club and Costco, independent health food stores, dietary supplement retailers, drug stores, farmers&#8217; markets, food co-ops, online retailers and multi-level marketers. These businesses compete with us for customers on the basis of price, selection, quality, customer service, shopping experience or any combination of these or other factors. They also compete with us for products and locations. In addition, some of our competitors are expanding to offer a greater range of natural and organic foods. We believe our commitment to carrying only carefully vetted, affordably priced and high-quality natural and organic products and dietary supplements, as well as our focus on providing nutritional education, differentiate us in the industry and provide a competitive advantage. In addition, we face internally generated competition when we open new stores in markets we already serve. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is active throughout the calendar year and does not experience significant fluctuation caused by seasonal changes in consumer purchasing. 

&#160; 

Insurance and Risk Management&#160; 

&#160; 

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to cover workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, product liability, director and officers&#8217; liability, employment practices liability, employee healthcare benefits and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements and providers on an ongoing basis. 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe that our intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We have received the registration of trademarks not only for Vitamin Cottage and Health Hotline but also for our logo, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage &#174; and Vitamin Cottage Natural Grocers &#174; for appropriate categories of trade. In addition, we have received the registration of service marks for EDAP &#8211; Every Day Affordable Price and {N} Power and the registration of a trademark for These Came First &#174; . We do not own or license for use any patents, franchises or concessions that are material to our business. Our trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained. 

&#160; 

Information Technology Systems 

&#160; 

We have made significant investments in overhead and information technology infrastructure, including purchasing, receiving, inventory, point of sale, warehousing, distribution, accounting, reporting and financial systems. We use an ERP system with integrated merchandise management, reporting and accounting system at all of our stores, as well as at our bulk food repackaging facility and distribution center and for corporate functions including accounting, reporting and purchasing. Our ERP system application support and hardware functions are outsourced, which allows us to focus on our core business. We also have an enterprise-wide HRIS, which has enabled us to more efficiently and effectively onboard and train our employees at all locations. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Compliance 

&#160; 

The safety, formulation, manufacturing, processing, packaging, importation, labeling, promotion, advertising and distribution of products we sell in our stores, including private label products, are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), the USDA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency and various agencies of the states and localities. Pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates the safety, formulation, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labeling, importation and distribution of food and dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbs). In addition, the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate the promotion and advertising of these products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Dietary Supplements. The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, in particular by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). DSHEA established a framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements, defined &#8220;dietary supplement&#8221; and &#8220;new dietary ingredient&#8221; (NDI) and established new statutory criteria for evaluating the safety of substances meeting the respective definitions. In the process, DSHEA removed dietary supplements and NDIs from pre-market approval requirements that apply to food additives and pharmaceuticals and established a combination of &#8220;notification&#8221; and &#8220;post marketing controls&#8221; for regulating product safety. Notwithstanding, non-dietary ingredients in a dietary supplement remain subject to the FDA&#8217;s food additive authorities. The FDA does not require notification to market a dietary supplement if it contains only dietary ingredients that were present in the United States food supply prior to DSHEA&#8217;s enactment on October 15, 1994. However, for a dietary ingredient not present in the food supply prior to this date, or NDIs, the manufacturer must provide the FDA with information supporting the conclusion that the ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe at least 75 days before introducing a new dietary ingredient into interstate commerce. As required by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), the FDA issued draft guidance in July 2011 and August 2016, which attempted to clarify when an ingredient would be considered an NDI, the evidence needed to document the safety of an NDI and appropriate methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance has not been finalized. If finalized, the draft guidance may cause dietary supplement products available in the market before DSHEA to be classified to include an NDI if the dietary supplement product was produced using manufacturing processes different from those used in 1994. 

&#160; 

In certain circumstances, the FDA&#8217;s guidance regarding applications for approval of Investigational New Drugs (INDs) applies to the food and dietary supplement industry. The FDA&#8217;s guidance states that certain dietary supplements should not be marketed if they contain a substance that is undergoing substantial clinical investigations intended to evaluate the dietary supplement&#8217;s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease when such investigations are public knowledge, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement before the IND application became effective and before any such investigations began. Although the boundaries of the FDA&#8217;s enforcement activities regarding alleged violations of its guidance are not clear at this time, some dietary supplements might have to be immediately withdrawn from the market even if they were marketed as a dietary supplement before initiation of substantial clinical investigations, the existence of which has been made public. The potential need for withdrawal could negatively affect the supply chain for certain products. 

&#160; 

DSHEA empowered the FDA to establish good manufacturing practice regulations governing key aspects of the production of dietary supplements, including quality control, packaging and labeling. DSHEA also expressly permits dietary supplements to bear statements describing how a product affects the structure, function and general well-being of the body, if accompanied by a required disclaimer. Currently, although manufacturers must be able to substantiate any such statement, no pre-market approval authorization is required for such statements and manufacturers need only notify FDA that they are employing a given claim within 30 days of first marketing the product. No statement may expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. DSHEA does, however, authorize supplement sellers to provide &#8220;third-party literature,&#8221; (e.g., a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits) in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers. This provision is an exception to the FDA&#8217;s broad powers over the promotion of regulated products. Accordingly, the authorization is limited and applies only if the publication is printed in its entirety, is not false or misleading, presents a balanced view of the available scientific information and does not &#8220;promote&#8221; a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement and is displayed in an area physically separate from the dietary supplements. 

&#160; 

Food. The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients, other than dietary supplements. Food additives and food contact substances are subject to pre-market approvals or notification requirements. The FDA&#8217;s overall food safety authority was dramatically enhanced in 2011 with the passage of FSMA. FSMA required the FDA to issue regulations mandating that risk-based preventive controls be observed by the majority of food producers. Regulations and rules issued under FSMA are in varying degrees of finalization and implementation. Regardless, the FDA&#8217;s authority under FSMA applies to all domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to all foreign facilities that supply us with food products. In addition, FSMA required the FDA to establish science-based minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of produce, identify &#8220;high risk&#8221; foods and &#8220;high risk&#8221; facilities, set goals for the frequency of FDA inspections of such high risk facilities as well as non-high risk facilities and foreign facilities from which food is imported into the United States. With respect to both foods and dietary supplements, FSMA meaningfully augmented the FDA&#8217;s ability to access both producers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; records, as well as added new records that must be created and maintained. This increased access could cause the FDA to identify areas of concern it had not previously considered to be problematic for our suppliers and contract manufacturers. FSMA also gives the FDA authority to require food producers, distributors and sellers to recall adulterated or misbranded food if the FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the food will cause serious adverse health consequences to persons or animals. Additionally, FSMA increases the FDA&#8217;s authority for administrative detentions of adulterated and misbranded foods. FSMA also could cause enhanced tracking and tracing of food requirements and, as a result, added recordkeeping burdens upon our suppliers and contract manufacturers. 

&#160; 

The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company&#8217;s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to product identification, net quantity/weight, nutritional facts, ingredients, manufacturer and the identity of certain allergens (if present). The FDA administers a pre-market authorization program applicable to foods and supplements alike regarding the use of &#8220;nutrient content&#8221; claims (e.g., &#8220;high in antioxidants,&#8221; &#8220;low in fat,&#8221; etc.), &#8220;health&#8221; claims (claims describing the relationship between a food substance and a health or disease condition) and &#8220;natural and &#8220;all natural&#8221; claims. &#8220;Organic&#8221; claims, however, are primarily regulated by the USDA. In addition, the FDA has authority over products falsely or misleadingly labeled &#8220;organic.&#8221; Products labeled &#8220;organic&#8221; must be certified by an accredited agent as compliant with USDA-established standards. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

FDA Enforcement. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, transport and promotion of foods and dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, institute an administrative detention of food, request or order a recall of illegal products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the United States courts. Pursuant to FSMA, the FDA also has the power to refuse the import of any food or dietary supplement from a foreign supplier that is not appropriately verified as in compliance with all FDA laws and regulations. Moreover, the FDA has the authority to administratively suspend the registration of any facility producing food, including supplements, deemed to present a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences. 

&#160; 

Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising. The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of &#8220;consent decrees&#8221; and penalties that can severely limit a company&#8217;s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. In addition, private parties are increasingly initiating legal action against dietary supplement manufacturers for false or misleading labeling and/or advertising. 

&#160; 

The FTC and FDA have authority to regulate the marketing and label claims of foods, functional foods, dietary supplements, probiotic preparations and homeopathic remedies. The agencies have suggested in published comments and court filings that health claims for these products should be based on two Random Controlled Trials (RTCs) or similar investigational research methods. It is not clear that RTCs designed to measure the effects and side effects of a medical drug on a human population suffering a disease are appropriate for measuring the efficacy of foods, functional foods, dietary supplements, probiotic preparations and homeopathic remedies to help maintain an individual&#8217;s healthy non-diseased state. If the FTC and FDA final guidance do not reflect these concerns, and if RTCs or similar methods are required in the future, the high cost and delays of RTCs or other investigational methods may disrupt the supply chain for these products or cause their removal from the market. 

&#160; 

Compliance. As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification and insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate certifications, representations and warranties, insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in the products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our stores. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, to ensure compliant practices, our employees working in our stores are trained regularly on how to provide customer service using an educational approach that is ethical, honest, accurate and does not cross over into a scope of practice reserved for licensed healthcare professionals. For instance, we do not allow discussion of any &#8220;disease&#8221; or &#8220;cure.&#8221; Instead, we focus on how the structure and function of the body is affected by lifestyle choices and the different nutritional components of an individual&#8217;s diet, including those contained in dietary supplements. Our customers are encouraged to make informed decisions about their diet, lifestyle, and possible need for supplementation. We also conduct internal compliance reviews on all free nutrition literature that we make available to our customers upon request with the goal of ensuring that these materials only reference relevant dietary supplement ingredients and not any particular brands or products. One responsibility of the Nutritional Health Coach is to oversee our FDA and FTC compliance measures. We believe that our nutrition education practices are in compliance with federal and state requirements, but a finding to the contrary could pose significant issues with respect to our business and reputation among our customers or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

New or revised government laws and regulations affecting our business or our industry, such as those relating to genetically modified foods, could result in additional compliance costs and civil remedies. The risks associated with these laws and regulations are further described under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;
