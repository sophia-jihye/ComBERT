 ITEM 1. 

Business 

Introduction 

Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust is a statutory trust formed in June 2011 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to an initial trust agreement by and among Chesapeake, as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), and The Corporation Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the &#8220;Delaware Trustee&#8221;). The Trust maintains its offices at the office of the Trustee, which is located at 919 Congress Avenue, Suite 500, Austin, Texas 78701, and the telephone number of the Trustee is (512) 236-6555. 

The Trustee maintains a website for filings by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Electronic filings by the Trust with the SEC are available free of charge through the Trust's website at www.chkgranitewashtrust.com &#32;or through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . The Trust will also provide electronic and paper copies of its recent filings free of charge upon request to the Trustee. Documents and information on the Trust's website are not incorporated by reference herein. 

General 

The Trust was created to own the Royalty Interests for the benefit of Trust unitholders pursuant to a trust agreement dated as of June 29, 2011 and subsequently amended and restated as of November 16, 2011 by and among Chesapeake, Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (the &#8220;Trust Agreement&#8221;). The Royalty Interests are derived from Chesapeake's interests in specified oil and natural gas properties located in the Colony Granite Wash play in Washita County in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma (the &#8220;Underlying Properties&#8221;). Chesapeake conveyed the Royalty Interests to the Trust from Chesapeake's interests in the Producing Wells and the Development Wells. 

The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. The Trust Agreement limits the Trust's business activities generally to owning the Royalty Interests and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests and derivative contracts between the Trust and its counterparty . &#32;The royalty interests in the Producing Wells (the &#8220;PDP Royalty Interest&#8221;) entitle the Trust to receive 90% of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Chesapeake's net revenue interest in the Producing Wells. The royalty interests in the Development Wells (the &#8220;Development Royalty Interest&#8221;) entitle the Trust to receive 50% of the proceeds (exclusive of any production or development costs but after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes) from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Chesapeake's net revenue interest in the Development Wells. 

Through an initial public offering in November 2011, the Trust sold to the public 23,000,000 common units, representing beneficial interests in the Trust, for cash proceeds of approximately $409.7 million, net of offering costs. The Trust delivered the net proceeds of the initial public offering, along with 12,062,500 common units and 11,687,500 subordinated units, to certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Chesapeake in exchange for the conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the Trust. Upon completion of these transactions, there were 46,750,000 Trust units issued and outstanding, consisting of 35,062,500 common units and 11,687,500 subordinated units. The common units and subordinated units have identical rights and privileges, except with respect to their voting rights and rights to receive distributions as described below under Target Distributions and Subordination and Incentive Thresholds. 

The subordinated units are entitled to receive pro rata distributions from the Trust each quarter if and to the extent there is sufficient cash to provide a cash distribution on the common units that is no less than 80% of the target distribution set forth in the Trust Agreement for the corresponding quarter (the &#8220;subordination threshold&#8221;). If there is not sufficient cash to fund such a distribution on all of the Trust units, the distribution to be made with respect to the subordinated units will be reduced or eliminated for such quarter in order to make a distribution, to the extent possible, of up to the subordination threshold amount on the common units. In exchange for agreeing to subordinate a portion of its Trust units, and in order to provide additional financial incentive to Chesapeake to satisfy its drilling obligation and perform operations on the Underlying Properties in an efficient and cost-effective manner, Chesapeake is entitled to receive incentive distributions equal to 50% of the amount by which the cash available for distribution on all of the Trust units in any quarter is 20% greater than the target distribution for such quarter (the &#8220;incentive threshold&#8221;). The remaining 50% of cash available for distribution in excess of the applicable incentive threshold will be paid to Trust unitholders, including Chesapeake, on a pro rata basis. 

Neither the Trust nor the Trustee is responsible for , &#32;or has any control over , &#32;any costs related to the drilling of the Development Wells or any other operating or capital costs of the Underlying Properties. The Trust's cash receipts with respect to the Royalty Interests in the Underlying Properties are determined after deducting certain post-production expenses and any applicable taxes associated with the Royalty Interests. Post-production expenses generally consist of costs incurred to gather , &#32;store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market the oil, natural gas and NGL produced. However , &#32;the Trust is not responsible for costs of marketing services provided by affiliates of Chesapeake. Cash distributions to unitholders will be increased or decreased by the effect of the Trust's derivative contracts and reduced by the Trust's general and administrative expenses. See Derivative Contracts below . 

The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on June 30, 2031, or earlier upon certain events (the &#8220;Termination Date&#8221;), and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. At the Termination Date, (a) 50% of the total Royalty Interests conveyed by Chesapeake (the &#8220;Term Royalties&#8221;) will revert automatically to Chesapeake and (b) 50% of the total Royalty Interests conveyed by Chesapeake (the &#8220;Perpetual Royalties&#8221;) will be retained by the Trust and thereafter sold. The net proceeds of the sale of the Perpetual Royalties, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, will be distributed to the unitholders on a pro rata basis. Chesapeake will have a right of first refusal to purchase the Perpetual Royalties retained by the Trust at the Termination Date. 

Target Distributions and Subordination and Incentive Thresholds 

The Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its quarterly cash receipts, after deducting the Trust's administrative expenses, on or about 60 days following the completion of each quarter through (and including) the quarter ending June 30, 2031. Quarterly distributions to Trust unitholders will generally include royalty income attributable to sales of oil, natural gas and NGL for three months, including the first two months of the quarter just ended and the last month of the quarter prior to that one. The first quarterly distribution was made on December 28, 2011 to record unitholders as of December 15, 2011. 

In connection with the initial public offering of the Trust, Chesapeake established quarterly target levels of cash distributions to unitholders for the life of the Trust. These target distributions were used to calculate the subordination and incentive thresholds described in more detail below and do not represent estimates of the actual distributions that may be received by Trust unitholders. Actual cash distributions to the Trust unitholders will fluctuate quarterly based on the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL sold from the Underlying Properties, the prices received for such sales, the timing of Chesapeake's receipt of payment for such sales, payments or receipts under the Trust's derivative contracts, the Trust's expenses and other factors. While target distributions initially increase as Chesapeake completes its drilling obligation and production increases, target distributions will decline over time as a result of the depletion of the reserves in the Underlying Properties. 

Subordination Threshold. In order to provide support for cash distributions on the common units, Chesapeake agreed to subordinate 11,687,500 of the Trust units retained following the initial public offering of common units, which constitute 25% of the outstanding Trust units. The subordinated units are entitled to receive pro rata distributions from the Trust each quarter if and to the extent there is sufficient cash to pay a cash distribution on the common units that is no less than 80% of the target distribution for the corresponding quarter. If there is not sufficient cash to fund such a distribution on all of the common units, the distribution to be made with respect to the subordinated units will be reduced or eliminated for such quarter in order to make a distribution, to the extent possible, of up to the subordination threshold amount on all the common units, including the common units held by Chesapeake. 

Incentive Threshold. In exchange for agreeing to subordinate a portion of its Trust units, and in order to provide additional financial incentive to Chesapeake to satisfy its drilling obligation and perform operations on the Underlying Properties in an efficient and cost-effective manner, Chesapeake is entitled to receive incentive distributions equal to 50% of the amount by which the cash available for distribution on all of the Trust units in any quarter is 20% greater than the target distribution for such quarter. The remaining 50% of cash available for distribution in excess of the applicable incentive threshold will be paid to the Trust unitholders, including Chesapeake, on a pro rata basis. 

At the end of the fourth full calendar quarter following Chesapeake&#8217;s satisfaction of its drilling obligation with respect to the Development Wells, the subordinated units will automatically convert into common units on a one-for-one basis and Chesapeake&#8217;s right to receive incentive distributions for any subsequent quarter will terminate. With respect to distributions for quarters following the fourth full quarter after Chesapeake's satisfaction of its Development Well drilling obligation, the common units will no longer have the protection of the subordination threshold, and all Trust 

unitholders will share on a pro rata basis in the Trust&#8217;s distributions. The period during which the subordinated units are outstanding is referred to as the subordination period. 

The following table sets forth the subordination threshold and the incentive threshold for each calendar quarter through the second quarter of 2017, as established in the Trust Agreement:

For each quarter, the subordination threshold equals 80% of the target distribution and the incentive threshold equals 120% of the target distribution. The subordination and incentive thresholds terminate after the distribution is made for the fourth full calendar quarter following Chesapeake's completion of its drilling obligation.

A distribution of $0.2195 per common unit was paid on March 1, 2016 &#32;to common unitholders of record, other than Chesapeake, as of February 19, 2016 . Chesapeake received $0.0369 per common unit and waived its right to receive the higher distribution on its units with respect to the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The Trust's distributable income for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1567 per common unit. As the distributable income per common unit was below the subordination threshold, no distribution was declared for the subordinated units. See Note 7 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the distribution paid on March 1, 2016.

For the production periods from September 2014 through August 2015, the distribution per common unit was below the applicable subordination threshold, and no distribution was declared for the subordinated units. 

As of March 9, 2016 , Chesapeake owned 12,062,500 common units and all 11,687,500 subordinated units, which together represent 50.8% of the outstanding Trust units. 

Derivative Contracts 

All of the Trust's derivative contracts expired on September 30, 2015. The Trust's derivative contracts were intended to manage its exposure to adverse changes in oil prices. On November 16, 2011, Chesapeake novated the derivative contracts to the Trust pursuant to which the Trust became party to derivative contracts covering a portion of its expected production from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2015. These derivative contracts consisted of fixed-price oil swaps, in which the Trust received a fixed price and paid a floating market price, based on NYMEX settlement prices, to the counterparty for the underlying commodity of the derivative. As a party to these contracts, the Trust received payments directly from its counterparty or was required to pay any amounts owed directly to its counterparty. All swaps were net settled based on the difference between the fixed-price payment and the floating-price payment. Settlements were due on a quarterly basis, including the first two months of the calendar quarter just ended and the last month of the calendar quarter prior to that one. Any payment due to or from such counterparty was made by the 40th day following the end of the calendar quarter in which such payments became due. See Note 3 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the derivative contracts. 

Under the derivative contracts and separate from the drilling obligation under the development agreement, there was a requirement that Chesapeake drill and complete, or cause to be drilled and completed, a specified number of wells (inclusive of the Producing Wells as of the completion of the initial public offering and Development Wells) by the end of each six-month period ended June 30 and December 31 during the term of the derivative contracts. Specifically, from November 16, 2011 until June 30, 2016, the derivative contracts required that Chesapeake drill and complete, cause to be drilled and completed or participate as a non-operator in the drilling of 117 wells. As of December 31, 2015, Chesapeake had drilled and completed 172 wells and had fulfilled the cumulative minimum well requirement under the derivative contracts. The derivative contracts covered a portion of the production attributable to Royalty Interests from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2015, but did not and will not cover any production beginning October 1, 2015. In addition, if oil prices remain at current levels, we anticipate that there may be a further substantial decline in cash distributions resulting from lower realized oil prices beginning with the 2016 first quarter distribution, as the derivative contracts on oil production expired for production in the period ended September 30, 2015. Settlement of these derivative contracts continued through February 2016. For additional information related to the impact of price fluctuations see Item 1A. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time will reduce proceeds to the Trust, Chesapeake's economic incentive to drill and cash distributions to unitholders. 

The derivative contracts were not qualified for hedge accounting treatment, and therefore all mark-to-market fluctuations were recorded to Trust corpus when cash settled. The value of the derivative contracts as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was a net asset of $ 2.1 million . 

With respect to each such six-month period ended June 30 and December 31 during the term for the derivative contracts, the Trust was required to deliver to the counterparty and the collateral agent under the derivative contracts (a) an independent reserve engineers' report that set forth the total reserves estimated to be attributable to the Trust's interest in the Underlying Properties as of the end of such period and such other information as is typically included in, or required under SEC rules to be included in, summary reserve engineers reports and (b) a report that set forth certain information regarding the Development Wells drilled and completed as of the end of such six-month period. 

The Trust&#8217;s obligations to the counterparty under the derivative contracts were secured by liens on proved reserves attributable to the Trust&#8217;s interest in the Underlying Properties. The counterparty&#8217;s obligations under the derivative contracts were required to be secured by cash or short-term U.S. Treasury instruments to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to the Trust exceed defined thresholds. Mark-to-market amounts exceeded the defined thresholds and collateral had been posted by the counterparty as of December 31, 2015 . 

Administrative Services Agreement 

On November 16, 2011, the Trust entered into an administrative services agreement with Chesapeake, effective July 1, 2011, pursuant to which Chesapeake provides the Trust with certain accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and information services related to the Royalty Interests and the registration rights agreement. In return for the services provided by Chesapeake under the administrative services agreement, the Trust pays Chesapeake an annual fee of $200,000, which is paid in equal quarterly installments and remains fixed for the life of the Trust. Chesapeake is also entitled to receive reimbursement for its actual out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services under the agreement. 

Additionally, the administrative services agreement established Chesapeake as the Trust's hedge manager, pursuant to which Chesapeake has the authority, on behalf of the Trust, to administer the Trust's derivative contracts. As hedge manager, Chesapeake also has authority to terminate, restructure or otherwise modify all or any portion of the Trust's derivative contracts to the extent that Chesapeake reasonably determines, acting in good faith, that the volumes hedged under such contracts exceed, or are expected to exceed, the combined estimated production attributable to the Royalty Interests over the periods hedged. However, in fulfilling its role as hedge manager, Chesapeake is not acting as a fiduciary for the Trust and has no affirmative duty to modify any of the Trust's derivative contracts, except as required by the derivative contracts. Moreover, under the Trust Agreement, Chesapeake is indemnified by the Trust for any actions it takes in this regard. 

The administrative services agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the date the Trust shall have been wound up in accordance with the Trust Agreement, (b) the date that all of the Royalty Interests have been terminated or are no longer held by the Trust, (c) with respect to services to be provided with respect to any Underlying Properties being transferred by Chesapeake, the date that either Chesapeake or the Trustee may designate by delivering 90-days prior written notice, provided that Chesapeake's drilling obligation has been completed and the transferee of such Underlying Properties assumes responsibility to perform the services in place of Chesapeake or (d) a date mutually agreed by Chesapeake and the Trustee. 

Description of the Trust 

Common Units and Subordinated Units. Each Trust unit is a unit of the beneficial interest in the Trust and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the Trust on a pro rata basis. The Trust has 46,750,000 Trust units issued and outstanding, consisting of 35,062,500 common units and 11,687,500 subordinated units. The common units and subordinated units have identical rights and privileges, except with respect to their voting rights and rights to receive distributions. 

The subordinated units will automatically convert into common units on a one-for-one basis at the end of the fourth full calendar quarter following Chesapeake's satisfaction of its drilling obligation to the Trust with respect to the Development Wells. Chesapeake currently intends to complete its drilling obligation on or before June 30, 2016. 

Distributions and Income Computations. The Trust is required to make quarterly cash distributions to unitholders from its available funds for such calendar quarter. Royalty Interest payments due to the Trust with respect to any calendar quarter are based on actual sales volumes attributable to the Trust's interests in the Underlying Properties (as measured at Chesapeake's metering systems) for the first two months of the quarter just ended as well as the last month of the immediately preceding quarter and actual revenues received for such volumes. Chesapeake makes the Royalty Interest payments to the Trust within 35 days of the end of each calendar quarter. In addition, any payments due from or required to be made to the counterparty under the Trust's derivative contracts are paid within 40 days of the end of such calendar quarter. Taking into account the receipt and disbursement of all such amounts, the Trustee determines for such calendar quarter the amount of funds available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust over the Trust's expenses for that quarter. Available funds are reduced by any cash the Trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future liabilities. 

The Trustee distributes cash approximately 60 days (or the next succeeding business day following such day if such day is not a business day) following each calendar quarter to each person who is a Trust unitholder of record on the quarterly record date together with interest expected to be earned on the amount of such quarterly distribution from the date of receipt thereof by the Trustee to the payment date. 

Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the IRS, the Trustee treats the income and expenses of the Trust for each quarter as belonging to the Trust unitholders of record on the quarterly record date that occurs in such quarter. Trust unitholders recognize income and expenses for tax purposes in the quarter the Trust receives or pays those amounts, rather than in the quarter the Trust distributes them. Minor variances may occur. For example, the Trustee could establish a reserve in one quarter that would not result in a tax deduction until a later quarter. The Trustee could also make a payment in one quarter that would be amortized for tax purposes over several months. 

Transfer of Trust Units. Trust unitholders may transfer their Trust units in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The Trustee does not require either the transferor or transferee to pay a service charge for any transfer of a Trust unit. The Trustee may require payment of any tax or other governmental charge imposed for a transfer. The Trustee may treat the owner of any Trust unit as shown by its records as the owner of the Trust unit. The Trustee will not be considered 

to know about any claim or demand on a Trust unit by any party except the record owner. A person who acquires a Trust unit after any quarterly record date will not be entitled to the distribution relating to that quarterly record date. Delaware law will govern all matters affecting the title, ownership or transfer of Trust units. 

Periodic Reports. The Trustee files all required Trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The Trustee prepares and mails to Trust unitholders a Schedule K-1 and also causes to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 

Each Trust unitholder and his representatives have the right, at his own expense and during reasonable business hours upon reasonable prior notice, to examine and inspect the records of the Trust and the Trustee in reference thereto for any purpose reasonably related to the Trust unitholder's interest as a Trust unitholder. 

Liability of Trust Unitholders. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. No assurance can be given, however, that the courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware will give effect to such limitation. 

Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders. The Trustee or Trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding Trust units may call meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust does not intend to hold annual meetings of the Trust unitholders. The Trust is responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of Trust unitholders unless such meeting is called by the Trust unitholders, in which case the Trust unitholders are responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting of Trust unitholders. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the Trustee in the notice of such meeting. The Trustee must send written notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the Trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of Trust units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each Trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each Trust unit owned. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be deemed to be a vote cast. 

Unless otherwise required by the Trust Agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the vote of a majority of the Trust units held by the Trust unitholders voting in person or by proxy at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true, even if a majority of the total outstanding Trust units did not approve it. 

Until such time as Chesapeake and its affiliates own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of common units (excluding common units owned by Chesapeake and its affiliates) and a majority of Trust units voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present is required to: 

&#8226; 

dissolve the Trust (except in accordance with its terms); 

&#8226; 

remove the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee; 

&#8226; 

amend the Trust Agreement, the royalty conveyances, the administrative services agreement, the development agreement and the Drilling Support Liens, as defined below under Regulation (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of Trust unitholders in any material respect); 

&#8226; 

merge, consolidate or convert the Trust with or into another entity; or 

&#8226; 

approve the sale of all or any material part of the assets of the Trust. 

At any time when Chesapeake and its affiliates own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the vote of the holders of a majority of Trust units, including units owned by Chesapeake, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present will be required to take the actions described above. 

Certain amendments to the Trust Agreement may be made by the Trustee without approval of the Trust unitholders. The Trustee must consent before all or any part of the Trust assets can be sold except in connection with the dissolution of the Trust or limited sales directed by Chesapeake in conjunction with its sale of Underlying Properties. 

Description of the Trust Agreement. The Trust was created under Delaware law as a separate legal entity to acquire and hold the Royalty Interests for the benefit of the Trust unitholders pursuant to the Trust Agreement among Chesapeake, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. The Royalty Interests are passive in nature and neither the Trust 

nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. Neither Chesapeake nor other operators of the Underlying Properties have any contractual commitments to the Trust to provide additional funding or to conduct further drilling on or to maintain their ownership interest in any of these properties other than the obligations of Chesapeake to drill the Development Wells. 

The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust's business activities are generally limited to owning the Royalty Interests, being a party to the derivative contracts and any activities reasonably related thereto, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. As a result, the Trust is not generally permitted to acquire other oil, natural gas and NGL properties or royalty interests. The Trust is not able to issue any additional Trust units. 

Contractual Rights and Assets of the Trust. Contractual rights of the Trust include the development agreement, Drilling Support Lien and administrative services agreement. The assets of the Trust consist of the Royalty Interests, the derivative contracts and any cash and temporary investments being held for the payment of expenses and liabilities and for distribution to the Trust unitholders. 

Duties and Powers of the Trustee. The duties and powers of the Trustee are specified in the Trust Agreement and by the laws of the State of Delaware, except as modified by the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee shall not have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, except as expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement and the duties and liabilities of the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreement replace any other duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to which the Trustee might otherwise be subject. 

The Trustee's principal duties consist of: 

&#8226; 

collecting cash proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests; 

&#8226; 

paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trust's assets; 

&#8226; 

receiving and making payments under the derivative contracts; 

&#8226; 

determining whether cash distributions exceed subordination or incentive thresholds, and making cash distributions to the unitholders and Chesapeake (with respect to incentive distributions) in accordance with the Trust Agreement; 

&#8226; 

causing to be prepared and distributed a Schedule K-1 for each Trust unitholder and to prepare and file tax returns on behalf of the Trust; and 

&#8226; 

causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading. 

Chesapeake will provide administrative and other services to the Trust in fulfillment of certain of the foregoing duties pursuant to the administrative services agreement. 

The Trustee may create a cash reserve to pay for future expenses of the Trust. If the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust's expenses, the Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds required to pay the expenses. The Trust may borrow the funds from any person, including the Trustee or its affiliates or, as described below, Chesapeake. The terms of such indebtedness, if funds were loaned by the entity serving as Trustee or Delaware Trustee, must be similar to the terms which such entity would grant to a similarly situated, unaffiliated commercial customer, and such entity shall be entitled to enforce its rights with respect to any such indebtedness as if it were not then serving as Trustee or Delaware Trustee. If the Trust borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid (except in certain circumstances, where the Trust borrows funds from Chesapeake). 

Each quarter, the Trustee will pay Trust obligations and expenses and distribute to the Trust unitholders the remaining proceeds received from the Royalty Interests and derivative contracts. The cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities must be invested in: 

&#8226; 

interest-bearing obligations of the U.S. government; 

&#8226; 

money market funds that invest only in U.S. government securities; 

&#8226; 

repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the U.S. government; or 

&#8226; 

bank certificates of deposit. 

Alternatively, cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a non-interest bearing account. 

The Trustee withheld approximately $1.0 million from the first distribution to establish an initial cash reserve available for Trust expenses. If the Trustee uses its cash reserve (or any portion thereof) to pay or reimburse Trust liabilities or expenses, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount) until the cash reserve is replenished. Additional cash reserves may also be established from time to time as determined by the Trustee to pay for future expenses of the Trust. This cash reserve will be part of the Trust estate and will bear interest at the same rate as other cash on hand in the Trust estate. Upon the dissolution of the Trust, after payment of Trust liabilities, the balance of the cash reserve (including accrued interest thereon) will be distributed to Trust unitholders on a pro rata basis. 

The Trust may not acquire any asset except the Royalty Interests, the other assets described above under Contractual Rights and Assets of the Trust , interests acquired in connection with foreclosure under the Drilling Support Lien and cash and temporary cash investments, and it may not engage in any investment activity except investing cash on hand. Chesapeake, acting as hedge manager for the Trust, may cause the Trust to restructure existing derivative contracts in certain circumstances. 

The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee will not make business decisions affecting the assets of the Trust. However, the Trustee may: 

&#8226; 

prosecute or defend, and settle, claims of or against the Trust or its agents; 

&#8226; 

foreclose on the Drilling Support Lien if Chesapeake does not satisfy its drilling obligation on or before June 30, 2016, and contract with a third-party operator to drill any remaining Development Wells, and transfer a portion of the Trust's assets in connection therewith; 

&#8226; 

retain professionals and other third parties to provide services to the Trust; 

&#8226; 

charge for its services as Trustee; 

&#8226; 

retain funds to pay for future expenses and deposit them with one or more banks or financial institutions (which may include the Trustee to the extent permitted by law); 

&#8226; 

lend funds at commercial rates to the Trust to pay the Trust's expenses; and 

&#8226; 

seek reimbursement from the Trust for its out-of-pocket expenses. 

In discharging its duty to Trust unitholders, the Trustee may act in its discretion and will be liable to the Trust unitholders only for willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence, and certain taxes, fees and other charges based on fees, commissions or compensation received by the Trustee in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable for any act or omission of its agents or employees unless the Trustee acts with willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in its selection and retention. The Trustee will be indemnified individually or as the Trustee for any liability or cost that it incurs in the administration of the Trust, except in cases of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. The Trustee has a lien on the assets of the Trust as security for this indemnification and its compensation earned as Trustee. Trust unitholders are not liable to the Trustee for any indemnification. The Trustee is obligated to ensure that all contractual liabilities of the Trust are limited to the assets of the Trust. 

The Trust may merge or consolidate with or into, or convert into, one or more limited partnerships, general partnerships, corporations, business trusts, limited liability companies, or associations or unincorporated businesses if such transaction is agreed to by the Trustee and approved by the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units and a majority of the common units (excluding common units owned by Chesapeake and its affiliates) in each case 

voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present and such transaction is permitted under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and any other applicable law. At any time that Chesapeake and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, however, the standard for approval will be the vote of a majority of the Trust units, including units owned by Chesapeake voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present. 

Trustee's Power to Sell Trust Assets. The Trustee may sell Trust assets, including the Royalty Interests, under any of the following circumstances: 

&#8226; 

the sale is requested by Chesapeake, following the satisfaction of its drilling obligation, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement; 

&#8226; 

the sale is approved by the vote of holders representing a majority of the Trust units and a majority of the common units (excluding common units owned by Chesapeake and its affiliates) in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that Chesapeake and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the standard for approval will be the vote of a majority of the Trust units, including units owned by Chesapeake voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; or 

&#8226; 

in connection with a foreclosure on the Drilling Support Lien. 

Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee must sell the remaining Royalty Interests. No Trust unitholder approval is required in this event. 

The Trustee will distribute the net proceeds from any sale of the Royalty Interests and other assets to the Trust unitholders after payment or reasonable provision for payment of the liabilities of the Trust. 

Dispute Resolution. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute, controversy or claim that may arise between Chesapeake and the Trustee relating to the Trust will be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators. 

Trust Fees and Expenses. The Trust is a party to derivative contracts and the Trust previously has had, and in the future could have, payment obligations under such arrangements. Otherwise, the Trust does not conduct an active business and the Trustee has little power to incur obligations. As a result, it is expected that the Trust will only incur liabilities for routine administrative expenses, such as legal, accounting, audit, tax advisory, engineering, printing and other administrative and out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or at the direction of the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, including tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and mailing costs; independent auditor fees; and registrar and transfer agent fees. The Trust is also responsible for paying costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders. Moreover, the Trustee's and the Delaware Trustee's compensation, and the fee payable to Chesapeake pursuant to the administrative services agreement, are paid out of the Trust's assets. 

Chesapeake Obligation to Fund Trust Expenses in Certain Circumstances . Chesapeake has agreed that, if at any time the Trust's cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust's ordinary course expenses as they become due, Chesapeake will lend funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any funds loaned by Chesapeake pursuant to this commitment will be limited to the payment of current accounts payable or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or the payment of other accrued current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust's business, and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness for borrowed money. If Chesapeake lends funds pursuant to this commitment, unless Chesapeake agrees otherwise, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount) until such loan is repaid. Any such loan will be on an unsecured basis, and the terms of such loan will be substantially the same as those which would be obtained in an arms' length transaction between Chesapeake and an unaffiliated third party. As of December 31, 2015, a $175,000 loan was outstanding with Chesapeake and the loan was repaid in March 2016. Chesapeake agreed to permit the Trust to continue making distributions while the loan was outstanding. 

Duration of the Trust; Sale of Royalty Interests . &#32;The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on June 30, 2031, or earlier upon certain events, and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. At the Termination Date, the Term Royalties will revert automatically to Chesapeake. Following the Termination Date, the Perpetual Royalties will be sold by the Trust and the net proceeds of the sale, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, will be distributed 

to the unitholders pro rata. Chesapeake will have a right of first refusal to purchase the Perpetual Royalties from the Trust following the Termination Date. 

The Trust will not dissolve until the Termination Date, unless: 

&#8226; 

the Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests; 

&#8226; 

cash available for distribution is less than $1.0 million for any four consecutive quarters; 

&#8226; 

the holders of a majority of the Trust units and a majority of the common units (excluding common units owned by Chesapeake and its affiliates) in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present vote in favor of dissolution; except that at any time that Chesapeake and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the standard for approval will be a majority of the Trust units, including units owned by Chesapeake voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; or 

&#8226; 

the Trust is judicially dissolved. 

In the case of any of the foregoing, the Trustee would sell all of the Trust's assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders after payment, or reasonable provision for payment, of all Trust liabilities. 

Federal Income Tax Considerations 

The Trust's federal income tax reporting position is that it is classified as a partnership for federal and applicable state income tax purposes. This position relies on the opinion of Bracewell &#38; Giuliani L.L.P., former counsel to Chesapeake and the Trust, rendered in connection with the initial public offering of the Trust units, in which counsel opined that at least 90% of the Trust's gross income is qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Trust's federal income tax reporting positions are consistent with the Federal Income Tax Considerations section in the prospectus filed by the Trust with the SEC on November 14, 2011 in connection with the initial public offering of its common units (the &#8220;Federal Income Tax Considerations Section in the Prospectus&#8221;). However, as discussed in detail below under Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Tax Risks Related to the Trust's Common Units , the Trust has not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding its United States federal income tax reporting positions and its positions may not be sustained by a court or if contested by the IRS. 

Additional information regarding the opinion and material tax matters is discussed in the Federal Income Tax Considerations Section in the Prospectus. 

Competition and Markets 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Chesapeake competes with both major integrated and other independent oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of its business to explore, develop and operate its properties and market its production. Some of Chesapeake's competitors may have larger financial and other resources than Chesapeake. Competitive conditions may be affected by future legislation and regulations as the United States develops new energy and climate-related policies. In addition, some of Chesapeake's larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices, domestic and foreign political conditions, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, and overall economic conditions. Chesapeake also faces indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power. Chesapeake believes that its technological expertise, its exploration, land drilling and production capabilities and the experience of its management generally enable it to compete effectively. 

Recent declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have adversely impacted, and future price fluctuations of oil, natural gas and NGL will continue to directly impact, Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Trust's interest, and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL, neither the Trust nor Chesapeake can make reliable predictions of future supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL, future oil, natural gas and NGL prices or the effect of future oil, natural gas and NGL prices on the Trust. 

Regulation 

General 

All of Chesapeake's operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and natural gas industry is regulated at the federal, state and local levels, and some of the laws and regulations that govern its operations carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. Although Chesapeake has advised the Trustee that Chesapeake believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that the cost of compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations, such laws and regulations could be, and frequently are, amended or reinterpreted. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, Chesapeake is unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance or non-compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, local governments, the courts and federal agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Chesapeake has advised the Trustee that Chesapeake actively monitors regulatory developments applicable to the industry in order to anticipate, design and implement required compliance activities and systems. 

Exploration and Production 

The laws and regulations applicable to Chesapeake's exploration and production operations include requirements for permits or approvals to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations. Other activities subject to such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

seismic operations; 

&#8226; 

the location of wells; 

&#8226; 

construction and operations activities, including in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats; 

&#8226; 

the method of drilling and completing wells; 

&#8226; 

production operations, including the installation of flowlines and gathering systems; 

&#8226; 

air emissions and hydraulic fracturing; 

&#8226; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which oil and natural gas facilities are located, including the construction of well pads, pipelines, impoundments and associated access roads; 

&#8226; 

water withdrawal; 

&#8226; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; 

&#8226; 

the generation, storage, transportation treatment, recycling or disposal of hazardous waste, or other substances in connection with operations; 

&#8226; 

the construction and operation of underground injection wells to dispose of produced water and other liquid oilfield wastes; 

&#8226; 

the construction and operation of surface pits to contain drilling muds and other fluids associated with drilling operations; 

&#8226; 

the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and 

&#8226; 

the valuation and payment of royalties. 

Delays in obtaining permits or an inability to obtain new permits or permit renewals could inhibit Chesapeake's ability to execute its drilling and production plans. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit requirements could result in revocation of Chesapeake's permits, inability to obtain new permits and the imposition of fines and penalties. 

Chesapeake's exploration and production activities are also subject to various conservation regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells that may be drilled in a 

particular area) and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states, such as Oklahoma, allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states, such as Texas, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units and therefore, more difficult to fully develop a project if the operator owns or controls less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, some states' conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas Chesapeake can produce and to limit the number of wells and the locations at which Chesapeake can drill. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas regulatory authorities, including specifically the requirement to disclose certain information related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Chesapeake follows applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in its operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM on federal acreage). Furthermore, Chesapeake's well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers. Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. In June 2015, New York created a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing. Similar bans have been adopted by local governments, although many of these actions are the subject of legal challenges. 

In February 2014, the EPA released its final guidance on the use of diesel additives in hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA is also engaged in a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water resources in these states where the EPA is the permitted authority, including Pennsylvania, with a progress report released in late 2012 and a draft report released in June 2015. It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread systematic impacts on drinking water resources in the U.S., but there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing could affect drinking water resources. In addition, in March 2015, the BLM issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian land; however, enforcement of the rule has been delayed pending a decision in a legal challenge in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming. Further, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act in May 2014 seeking comments relating to the information that should be reported or disclosed for hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures and mechanisms for obtaining this information. These actions, in conjunction with other analyses by federal and state agencies to assess the impacts of hydraulic fracturing could spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, on February 16, 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) implemented a volume reduction plan for oil and natural gas disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. The OCC&#8217;s plan, in conjunction with a 191,000 barrel a day reduction plan already implemented in the Byron/Cherokee area, will create a total volume cutback of over 500,000 barrels per day, or about 40%. 

Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive for Chesapeake to conduct operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGL that Chesapeake is ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from the Underlying Properties. For further discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays. 

Regulation &#8211; &#32;Environment, Health and Safety 

Chesapeake&#8217;s operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the environment and natural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact its business activities in many ways, such as: 

&#8226; 

requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way Chesapeake can handle or dispose of wastes and other substances associated with operations; 

&#8226; 

limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas that contain endangered or threatened species and/or species of special statewide concern or their habitats; 

&#8226; 

requiring investigatory and remedial actions to address pollution caused by Chesapeake&#8217;s operations or attributable to former operations; 

&#8226; 

requiring noise, lighting, visual impact, odor and/or dust mitigation, setbacks, landscaping, fencing, and other measures; 

&#8226; 

restricting access to certain equipment or areas to a limited set of employees or contractors who have proper certification or permits to conduct work (e.g., confined space entry and process safety maintenance requirements); and 

&#8226; 

restricting or even prohibiting water use based upon availability, impacts or other factors. 

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures against Chesapeake, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial or restoration obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, local restrictions, such as state or local moratoria, city ordinances, zoning laws and traffic regulations, may restrict or prohibit the execution of Chesapeake's drilling and production plans. In addition, third parties, such as neighboring landowners, may file claims alleging property damage, nuisance or personal injury arising from Chesapeake's operations or from the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. 

The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Chesapeake monitors developments at the federal, state and local levels to inform their actions pertaining to future regulatory requirements that might be imposed to mitigate the costs of compliance with any such requirements and participates in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations and that share best practices and lessons learned in relation to pollution prevention and incident investigations. 

Below is a discussion of the major environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that relate to Chesapeake's business. Chesapeake has advised the Trustee that Chesapeake believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Chesapeake does not believe that compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. At this point, however, Chesapeake has advised the Trustee that it cannot reasonably predict what applicable laws, regulations or guidance may eventually be adopted with respect to its operations or the ultimate cost to comply with such requirements. 

Hazardous Substances and Waste 

Federal and state laws, in particular the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), regulate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. In the course of Chesapeake&#8217;s operations, it generates petroleum hydrocarbon wastes such as drill cuttings, produced water and ordinary industrial wastes. Under a longstanding legal framework, certain of these wastes are not subject to federal regulations governing hazardous wastes, although they are regulated under other federal and state waste laws. At various times in the past, proposals have been made to amend RCRA to eliminate the exemption applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes. Repeal or modifications of this exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or through changes in applicable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste Chesapeake is required to manage and dispose of and would cause Chesapeake, as well as its competitors, to incur increased operating expenses which could adversely affect the Royalty Interest payments due to the Trust. These wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and may thus become subject to more rigorous and costly compliance and disposal requirements. Such additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the Trust unitholders. 

Federal, state and local laws may also require Chesapeake to remove or remediate wastes or hazardous substances that have been previously disposed of or released into the environment. This can include removing or remediating wastes or hazardous substances disposed of or released by Chesapeake (or prior owners or operators) in accordance with then current laws, suspending or ceasing operations at contaminated areas, or performing remedial well plugging operations or response actions to reduce the risk of future contamination. Federal laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), and analogous state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered legally responsible for releases of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include 

the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site, and any person who accepted hazardous substances for transportation to the site. CERCLA and analogous state laws also authorize the EPA, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, third parties to take action to prevent or respond to threats to human health or the environment and/or seek recovery of the costs of such actions from responsible classes of persons. 

The Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act prohibits any underground injection unless authorized by a permit. Chesapeake recycles and reuses some produced water and also disposes of produced water in Class II UIC wells, which are designed and permitted to place the water into deep geologic formations, isolated from fresh water sources. Permits for Class II UIC wells may be issued by the EPA or by a state regulatory agency if the EPA has delegated its UIC Program authority. Because some states have become concerned that the disposal of produced water could under certain circumstances contribute to seismicity, they have adopted or are considering adopting additional regulations governing such disposal. 

Air Emissions 

Chesapeake&#8217;s operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including Chesapeake&#8217;s compressor stations, and impose various control, monitoring and reporting requirements. Permits and related compliance obligations under the CAA, each state&#8217;s development and promulgation of regulatory programs to comport with federal requirements, as well as changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non-attainment or near-non-attainment areas may require oil and gas exploration and production operators to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies. 

In 2012, the EPA published final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) that amended the existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and gas facilities and created new NSPS standards for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2015. In 2013 and 2014, the EPA issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and made additional clarifications to these rules. In December 2014, the EPA issued additional amendments to these rules that, among other things, distinguish between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarify that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements. In July 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel). Further, in September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the NSPS by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. In January 2016, the BLM also proposed rules to require additional efforts by producers to reduce venting, flaring and leaking of natural gas produced on federal and Indian lands. 

&#32;In 2010, the EPA published rules that require monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. Chesapeake, along with other industry groups, filed suit challenging certain provisions of the rules and are engaged in settlement negotiations to amend and correct the rules. Chesapeake has advised the Trustee that Chesapeake anticipates final resolution to this litigation in the near future. In October 2015, EPA finalized new reporting requirements for boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. In January 2016, the EPA proposed two more revisions to the greenhouse gas reporting rule. One proposal addresses leaks from oil and gas equipment and the other proposal is intended to improve implementation of the rule, while also proposing confidentiality determinations for the reporting of certain data elements to the program. 

In addition, in October 2015, the EPA published its final rule revising downward the ozone national ambient air quality standard to 70 parts per billion. Chesapeake's business and operations could be subject to increased operating and compliance costs associated with these regulations. 

Discharges into Waters 

The federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (CWA), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as U.S. waters. In June 2015, the EPA and USACE jointly published a rule regarding the definition of waters of the United States that substantially 

expands the waters regulated under the CWA. Implementation of the rule was temporarily stayed in October 2015 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pending further action. The placement of dredge or fill material into jurisdictional water or U.S. wetlands is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the USACE. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency delegated with EPA's authority. In April 2015, the EPA also published proposed pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). Further, Chesapeake's corporate policy prohibits discharge of produced water to surface waters. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure regulations require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities and construction activities. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that release oil into waters of the United States. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the United States. 

Health and Safety 

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws regulate the protection of the health and safety of Chesapeake's employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established workplace safety standards that provide guidelines for maintaining a safe workplace in light of potential hazards, such as employee exposure to hazardous substances. OSHA also requires employee training and maintenance of records, and the OSHA hazard communication standard and EPA community right-to-know regulations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 require Chesapeake to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations. 

Endangered Species 

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of Chesapeake's assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, it believes that it is in material compliance with the ESA. However, as a result of a settlement reached in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened over the next several years. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where Chesapeake intends to conduct construction activity and the imposition of seasonal restrictions on Chesapeake's construction or operational activities could materially limit or delay its plans. 

Global Warming and Climate Change 

At the federal level, EPA regulations require Chesapeake to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change, such as the President&#8217;s Climate Action Plan which calls for reducing methane emissions, could require Chesapeake to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that it sells. As discussed above, the EPA proposed new standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources in 2015. The potential increase in Chesapeake's operating costs could include new or increased costs to (a) obtain permits, (b) operate and maintain its equipment and facilities (through the reduction or elimination of venting and flaring of methane), (c) install new emission controls on its equipment and facilities, (d) acquire allowances authorizing its greenhouse gas emissions, (e) pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions and (f) administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. In addition to these federal actions, various state governments and/or regional agencies may consider enacting new legislation and/or promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as Chesapeake's equipment and operations. 

Operating Hazards and Insurance 

The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, Chesapeake could incur legal defense costs and 

could suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. Chesapeake's horizontal and deep drilling activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than vertical and shallow drilling operations. 

As a passive entity, the Trust does not maintain insurance policies for the Underlying Properties. Chesapeake maintains a control of well policy with a $50 million single well limit and a $100 million multiple wells limit that insures against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with drilling, completing and operating its wells. There is no assurance that this insurance will be adequate to cover all losses or exposure to liability. Chesapeake also carries a $460 million comprehensive general liability umbrella policy and a $150 million pollution liability policy. Chesapeake provides workers' compensation insurance coverage to employees in all states in which it operates. While Chesapeake has informed us that it believes these policies are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks and policy limits scale to Chesapeake's working interest percentage in certain situations. In addition, Chesapeake's insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on Chesapeake's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Chesapeake's insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against Chesapeake or may not be commercially available for purchase in the future. 

The Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests 

Overview . The Underlying Properties consist of working interests owned by Chesapeake located in the Colony Granite Wash play in Washita County in western Oklahoma arising from leases and farmout agreements related to properties from which the Royalty Interests were conveyed. The AMI consists of approximately 40,500 &#32;gross acres ( 26,400 &#32;net acres). As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, the total reserves estimated to be attributable to the Trust were 9,502 &#32;mboe ( 57% &#32;natural gas by volume) and 13,923 mboe (54% natural gas by volume), respectively. These amounts include 8,880 &#32;mboe of proved developed reserves and 622 &#32;mboe of proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 and 10,972 mboe of proved developed reserves and 2,951 mboe of proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014. The decrease in estimated total reserves attributable to the Trust of 4,421 mboe is primarily attributable to lower average commodity prices and the removal of PUDs that are not part of Chesapeake's drilling plan within the AMI. See Risk Factors &#8211; Actual reserves and future production may be less than current estimates, which could reduce cash distributions by the Trust and the valu e of the Trust units &#32;in Item 1A and Risks and Uncertainties &#32;in Note 2 to the financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of the decrease in reserves. 

The Colony Granite Wash is a subset of the greater granite wash plays of the Anadarko Basin. The Colony Granite Wash is located at the eastern end of a series of Des Moines-age granite wash fields that extend along the southern flank of the Anadarko Basin, approximately 60 miles into the Texas Panhandle. These granite wash fields were generally deposited as deep-water turbidites that result in relatively low risk, laterally extensive reservoirs. The productive members of the Colony Granite Wash are encountered between approximately 11,500 and 13,000 feet and lie stratigraphically between the top of the Des Moines formation (or top of Colony Granite Wash 'A') and the top of the Prue formation (or base of Colony Granite Wash 'C'). The individual productive members within the Colony Granite Wash may reach 200 feet or more in gross interval thickness and the targeted porosity zones within these individual members are generally 20 to 75 feet thick. The Colony Granite Wash is primarily a natural gas and natural gas condensate reservoir based on reserve volumes. However, oil and NGL production currently generates more revenue than natural gas production in the Colony Granite Wash due to prices that have historically been, and despite recent declines in commodity prices, continue to be higher for oil and NGL than for natural gas. Development costs for horizontal wells drilled and completed in the AMI during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 averaged approximately $23.32 per boe and $25.02 per boe, respectively, which are comparable to the development costs for other large-scale resource developments in the Mid-Continent in which Chesapeake operates. The decrease in average development costs of $1.70 per boe is primarily due to a decrease in drilling and completion costs as a result of Chesapeake's improved operating efficiencies. 

Chesapeake began drilling horizontal wells in the Colony Granite Wash in 2007. As of December 31, 2015 , Chesapeake is the largest leaseholder in the Colony Granite Wash, with approximately 43,200 &#32;net acres (of which approximately 26,400 &#32;net acres are subject to the Royalty Interests), the most active driller in the play, based on rig count, and produces the highest volumes from the Colony Granite Wash. Since 2007, there have been 286 Des Moines horizontal wells drilled in the Colony Granite Wash. Of those 286 wells, Chesapeake has drilled 227 wells and participated in another 49 wells. As of March 7, 2016 , there was one rig drilling horizontal wells in the AMI, which was 

operated by Chesapeake. While horizontal wells are more expensive than vertical wells, a horizontal well increases the production of hydrocarbons and adds significant recoverable reserves per well. In addition, an operator can achieve better returns on drilling investments with horizontal drilling because the production from one horizontal well is typically equal to the production from several vertical wells. While Chesapeake is the most active company in this play, as of March 7, 2016 , other operators in the Colony Granite Wash include publicly-listed companies such as Penn Virginia Corporation, Apache Corporation, and Marathon Oil Corporation and privately-held companies such as Chaparral Energy, Inc., Ward Petroleum Corporation and EnerVest Energy Partners. 

Royalty Interests. The Royalty Interests were conveyed from Chesapeake's interest in the Underlying Properties effective as of July 1, 2011. As of December 31, 2015 , the Trust on average owns a 47.6% net revenue interest in the Producing Wells and a 28.2% net revenue interest in the completed Development Wells. Chesapeake retains 10% of the proceeds from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to its net revenue interest in the Producing Wells, and 50% of the proceeds from the sales of production attributable to its net revenue interest in the Development Wells. 

The Royalty Interests were conveyed to the Trust by Chesapeake by means of conveyance instruments that were recorded in the appropriate real property records in Washita County , &#32;Oklahoma. The conveyance instruments obligate Chesapeake to act diligently and as a reasonably prudent oil and gas operator would act under the same or similar circumstances as if it were acting with respect to its own properties, disregarding the existence of the Royalty Interests as burdens affecting such properties. We refer to this standard as the "Reasonably Prudent Operator Standard." The Trustee has no ability to manage or influence the operation of the Underlying Properties. 

Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Reserves. &#32;Proved reserve quantities attributable to the Royalty Interests are calculated by multiplying the gross reserves for each property attributable to Chesapeake's interest by the net revenue interest assigned to the Trust in each property. The reserves related to the Underlying Properties include all proved reserves expected to be economically produced during the life of the properties. The reserves attributable to the Trust's interests include only the reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties that are expected to be produced within the 20-year period prior to the Termination Date as well as the residual 50% interest in the Royalty Interests that the Trust will own on the Termination Date and subsequently sell. 

All of the Trust's estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are located within the U.S. The table below sets forth information as of December 31, 2015 &#32;with respect to the estimated proved reserves of the Underlying Properties and Royalty Interests and the associated PV-10. Because the Trust will not bear federal income tax expense, PV-10 and the standardized measure of estimated future net revenue of the Royalty Interests are the same. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests. The reserve estimates were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott") in accordance with the criteria established by the SEC.

PV-10 for the Royalty Interests was calculated exclusive of any production or development costs. 

The proved reserves were determined using a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for oil, natural gas and NGL for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 1, 2015, without giving effect to derivative contracts, and were held constant for the life of the properties. The prices used in the reserve reports, as well as Chesapeake's internal reports, yield weighted average prices at the wellhead, which are based on first-day-of-the-month reference prices and adjusted for transportation and regional price differentials. For the Royalty Interests, costs of marketing services provided by Chesapeake's affiliates will not be charged to the Trust. The reference prices and the equivalent weighted average wellhead prices are presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2015 , the reserve estimates for the Royalty Interests included 622 &#32;mboe of reserves classified as PUDs, compared to 2,951 mboe as of December 31, 2014 . Presented below is a summary of changes in the proved undeveloped reserves for the Royalty Interests for 2015.

Proved undeveloped reserves, end of period 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , there were no PUDs that had remained undeveloped for five years or more. Chesapeake invested approximately $17 million in the Underlying Properties in 2015 to convert 979 (425 net to the Royalty Interests) mboe of PUDs to proved developed reserves. All costs were paid by Chesapeake, as the Trust is not responsible for the cost of development. The downward PUD revisions of 2,526 &#32;mboe related to the removal of PUDs that are not part of Chesapeake's drilling plan within the AMI and price-related revisions in PUDs developed in 2015. As a result of substantially lower commodity prices, Chesapeake reduced its operated rig count in the AMI in February 2015 from two rigs to one rig to slow the pace of its drilling program. Chesapeake will continue analyzing the impact of commodity prices and will adjust the current drilling program or operated rig count accordingly. 

The $5 &#32;million PV-10 attributable to the estimated PUDs of the Royalty Interests has been calculated assuming that Chesapeake will expend approximately $15 million to develop these reserves in 2016. The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, service costs, commodity prices and the availability of capital. Chesapeake's developmental drilling schedule for the remaining Development Wells is subject to revision and reprioritization throughout the year resulting from unknown factors such as unexpected developmental drilling results, title issues and infrastructure availability or constraints and Chesapeake's net revenue interest in each Development Well when drilled and completed. The proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;include only PUD locations which are immediate offsets to producing wells. 

The annual net decline rate on current producing properties is projected to be 27% from 2016 to 2017, 19% from 2017 to 2018, 16% from 2018 to 2019 and 14% from 2019 to 2020. As of December 31, 2015 , of the total proved reserves, 18,474 &#32;mboe and 8,880 &#32;mboe attributable to the Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests, respectively, were classified as proved developed reserves. 

Chesapeake's ownership interest used for calculating proved reserves and the associated estimated future net revenue assumed maximum participation by other parties to Chesapeake's farmout and participation agreements. SEC pricing used for calculating the estimated future net revenues attributable to proved reserves does not reflect actual market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL production sold subsequent to December 31, 2015 . 

The Trust's estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 , along with the changes in quantities and standardized measure of such 

reserves since January 1, 2013, are shown in Supplemental Disclosures About Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Producing Activities &#32;included in Item 8 of Part II. No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions to such estimates, and such revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that are ultimately recovered. Furthermore, the estimated future net revenue from proved reserves and the associated present value are based upon certain assumptions, including prices, future production levels and costs that may not prove correct. Future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of any estimate. 

Development Wells. Pursuant to the development agreement with the Trust, Chesapeake is obligated to drill, cause to be drilled or participate as a non-operator in the drilling of 118 Development Wells by June 30, 2016. Additionally, based on Chesapeake's assessment of the ability of a Development Well to produce in paying quantities, Chesapeake is obligated to either complete and tie into production or plug and abandon each Development Well. Chesapeake retained or will retain an interest in each of the Producing Wells and Development Wells, and it operates approximately 96% &#32;of the Producing Wells and completed Development Wells. Chesapeake expects to operate all of the remaining Development Wells through the completion of its drilling obligation. As of March 7, 2016 , Chesapeake had drilled and completed 98 &#32;wells within the AMI (approximately 106 &#32;of the 118 Development Wells as calculated under the development agreement). Until such time as Chesapeake has met its commitment to drill the Development Wells, Chesapeake will not drill or complete, and will not permit any other person within its control to drill or complete: (a) any well in the Colony Granite Wash formation or lease acreage included within the AMI for its own account; or (b) any well that will have a perforated segment within 600 feet of any perforated interval of any Development Well or Producing Well. Chesapeake's average net revenue interest in the oil and gas properties underlying the Development Royalty Interest is approximately 62%. The Development Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to receive 50% of the proceeds attributable to Chesapeake's net revenue interest in future production of oil, natural gas and NGL resulting from the drilling of the Development Wells. 

Chesapeake is credited for drilling one full Development Well if the perforated length of the well is equal to or greater than 3,500 feet and Chesapeake's net revenue interest in the well is equal to 52.0%. For wells with a perforated length that is less than 3,500 feet, and for wells in which Chesapeake has a net revenue interest greater than or less than 52.0%, Chesapeake receives proportionate credit. Given that Chesapeake's actual net revenue interest in each Development Well may be greater or less than 52.0% and the perforated length of each well drilled may be less than 3,500 feet, Chesapeake may be required to drill more or less than 118 wells in order to fulfill its drilling obligation. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and March 7, 2016, Chesapeake had drilled and completed 98 &#32;wells within the AMI (approximately 106 &#32;of the 118 Development Wells as calculated under the development agreement). Chesapeake's drilling activity with respect to the Development Wells is consistent with its intent to meet the drilling obligation contemplated by the development agreement. As of March 7, 2016, Chesapeake had drilled, or caused to be drilled, ten additional wells in the AMI that were awaiting completion. The current drilling schedule provides that these ten wells will be completed by June 30, 2016 and will fulfill Chesapeake&#8217;s drilling obligation with respect to the Trust. 

In drilling the Development Wells, Chesapeake is required to adhere to the Reasonably Prudent Operator Standard. Where Chesapeake does not operate the Underlying Properties, Chesapeake is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise its contractual rights to cause the operators of such Underlying Properties to adhere to the Reasonably Prudent Operator Standard. Chesapeake expects that the drilling and completion techniques used for the remaining Development Wells will be generally consistent with those used for the Producing Wells and the completed Development Wells. 

The Trust will not bear any of the costs of drilling, completing and equipping the Development Wells. Until Chesapeake has satisfied its drilling obligation, it will not be permitted to drill or complete any well in the Colony Granite Wash formation on lease acreage included within the AMI for its own account. For the life of the Trust, Chesapeake will not be permitted to drill or complete any well that will have a perforated segment within 600 feet of any perforated interval of any Development Well or Producing Well. 

Chesapeake granted to the Trust a lien on its interest in the AMI (except the Producing Wells and any other wells that were already producing as of July 1, 2011 and are not subject to the Royalty Interests) in order to secure the estimated amount of the drilling costs for the Trust's interests in the Development Wells (the "Drilling Support Lien"). The amount obtained by the Trust pursuant to the Drilling Support Lien initially could not exceed $262.7 million. As Chesapeake fulfills its drilling obligation over time, Development Wells that are completed or that are perforated for completion and then plugged and abandoned are released from the Drilling Support Lien and the total dollar amount that may be recovered by the Trust for Chesapeake's failure to fulfill its drilling obligation is proportionately reduced. As of March 7, 2016 , the total dollar amount that may be recovered is approximately $26.5 &#32;million. 

Following the satisfaction of its drilling obligation to the Trust, Chesapeake may , &#32;without the consent or approval of the Trust unitholders, sell all or any part of Chesapeake's retained interest in the Underlying Properties. In any such sale by Chesapeake, the Underlying Properties must be sold subject to and burdened by the Royalty Interests, except that Chesapeake may require the Trust to release the Royalty Interests on such Underlying Properties with an aggregate value of up to $5.0 million during any 12-month period. In such event, the Trust must receive an amount equal to the fair value to the Trust of any royalty interests it sells. 

Well Locations. &#32;Chesapeake has approximately 48 remaining possible drilling locations within the AMI, based on assumed spacing of three wells per 640-acre section, of which it plans to drill and complete approximately ten additional wells by June 30, 2016. Chesapeake may drill some of the Development Wells on units that encompass land controlled by third-party operators in order to maximize recovery in the field and also maximize the perforated length of each Development Well drilled. 

Drilling Activity . The following table sets forth information with respect to the wells Chesapeake drilled or participated in during the periods indicated that were located in the AMI. The information presented is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and should not be interpreted to present any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and quantities or economic value of reserves found. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which Chesapeake has a working interest and net wells are the sum of Chesapeake's fractional working interest owned in such gross wells.

_________________________________________________ 

(1) 

Gross and net developed acres are acres spaced or assignable to productive wells. The drilling unit for each Colony Granite Wash horizontal well comprises 640 acres. As such, developed acreage may include up to 640 acres assigned to each Colony Granite Wash horizontal well. 

(2) 

232 net acres are not held by production as of December 31, 2015, and Chesapeake's rights to develop the acreage will expire in 2016. Chesapeake is not under any obligation to retain this acreage for development. 

Prior to fulfilling its drilling obligation to the Trust, Chesapeake may, at its sole discretion, cause the Trust to exchange leased acreage in the AMI for other leased acreage in the sections adjacent to the AMI (such adjacent sections are referred to as the "Development Area"). If additional acreage in the Development Area becomes subject 

to the Royalty Interests, then the AMI will automatically expand to include such acreage. In addition, if Chesapeake acquires any additional leases or interests in the AMI, Chesapeake may make such additional leases or interests subject to the Royalty Interests with respect to any Development Wells subsequently drilled on such acreage. However, the aggregate acreage attributable to the exchanged leases or additional leases or acreage may not exceed five percent of the acreage initially subject to the Royalty Interests and the reserve profile of the newly burdened acreage must be consistent with the reserve profile of the acreage released by the Trust. 

Marketing and Post-Production Services. Pursuant to the terms of the conveyances creating the Royalty Interests, Chesapeake has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil, natural gas and NGL production related to the Underlying Properties. While marketing costs of non-affiliates of Chesapeake are deducted from the proceeds upon which the royalty payments are calculated, the Trust is not responsible for costs of marketing services provided by Chesapeake or any of its affiliates. Chesapeake Energy Marketing, L.L.C. ("CEMLLC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake, markets the majority of Chesapeake's operated production. CEMLLC enters into oil, natural gas and NGL sales arrangements with large aggregators of supply, and these arrangements may be on a month-to-month basis or for a term of up to one year or longer . &#32;The oil, natural gas and NGL are sold at market prices and subsequently any applicable post-production expenses will be deducted. CEMLLC sells production from the Underlying Properties to a diverse group of aggregators, the identity of which changes from time to time. As a result, the proceeds to the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Underlying Properties is determined based on the same price (net of post-production costs and production taxes) that Chesapeake receives from third parties for oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to Chesapeake's remaining interest in the Underlying Properties. 

Post-production expenses are deducted from proceeds paid to the Trust. Williams Partners, L.P. ("WMB") (formerly known as Access Midstream Partners, L.P.), successor to previously-affiliated Chesapeake Midstream Partners, L.P. (Chesapeake had a 46% equity investment until June 2012), provides gathering, treating, compression and other post-production services and Enogex LLC ("Enogex") provides processing, transportation and other post-production services. The proceeds paid to the Trust are reduced by deductions for these post-production expenses. 

Post-production expenses may be deducted by the ultimate purchaser of the oil, natural gas and NGL prior to payment being made to Chesapeake or CEMLLC for such production. At other times, Chesapeake or CEMLLC makes payments directly to the applicable provider of such post-production services. In either instance, the Trust's cash available for distribution is reduced by the expenses incurred by Chesapeake or CEMLLC for such post-production services. If the post-production expenses are expressed as a percentage of the gross production from a well, then the volume of production from that well actually available for sale is less the applicable percentage charged, and as a result the reserves associated with that well that are attributable to the Royalty Interest are reduced accordingly . 

The post-production expenses are negotiated based on market conditions at the time or pursuant to a state or federal regulatory proceeding. Chesapeake is permitted to deduct from the proceeds available to the Trust other post-production expenses necessary to enhance the value of the oil, natural gas and NGL from the Underlying Properties and to transport such production to market. 

Natural gas and NGL produced from the Underlying Properties are gathered by gathering pipelines owned by WMB under a contract that expires in approximately 14 years. NGL and natural gas are processed at facilities owned by Enogex under a contract that expires in 2017 and then sold to a number of primary purchasers in the area. Oil produced from the Underlying Properties is gathered by gathering pipelines and equipment owned by WMB or transported by trucks owned by third parties and sold to FCX. In the event of a loss of its contracts with WMB, Enogex or FCX, Chesapeake believes that the availability of other customers and service providers in the area is sufficient to accommodate such loss. 

Chesapeake has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, oil, natural gas and NGL supply arrangements and post-production service arrangements for the oil, natural gas and NGL to be produced from the remaining Development Wells that are similar to those in place with respect to the Producing Wells and completed Development Wells. Any new oil, natural gas and NGL supply arrangements or those entered into for providing post-production services will be utilized in determining the proceeds for the Underlying Properties. 

Discussion and Analysis of Results from the Underlying Properties 

Historical Results . The Underlying Properties consist of the working interests owned by Chesapeake in the Colony Granite Wash in Washita County in western Oklahoma arising under leases and farmout agreements related to 

properties from which the PDP Royalty Interest and the Development Royalty Interest were conveyed. 

The following table provides revenues and direct operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013, as derived from the Underlying Properties' statements of revenues and direct operating expenses.

&#160; Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Revenues. &#32;For the year ended December 31, 2015 , oil, natural gas and NGL revenues were $40.7 million &#32;compared to $165.4 million &#32;and $194.8 million &#32;for the years ended 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The $124.7 million decrease in revenues from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in production of 2,244 &#32;mboe and a decrease in the average sales price of oil, natural gas and NGL. Average oil prices decreased $45.92 per bbl, from $89.50 &#32;per bbl to $43.58 &#32;per bbl. Average natural gas prices decreased $1.81 per mcf, from $2.53 &#32;per mcf to $0.72 &#32;per mcf. NGL prices decreased $15.18 per bbl, from $28.48 &#32;per bbl to $13.30 &#32;per bbl. The decrease in the 

price received per boe in 2015 compared to the 2014 resulted in a $56.8 million decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. Decreased sales volumes resulted in a $67.9 million decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, for a net decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $124.7 million. 

The $29.4 million decrease in revenues from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in production of 980 mboe partially offset by an increase in the sales price received per boe of $0.04. Decreased sales volumes resulted in a $29.6 million decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. The increase in the sales price received per boe in 2014 compared to the 2013 resulted in a $0.2 million increase in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, for a net decrease in oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $29.4 million. 

Production Expenses. &#32;For the year ended December 31, 2015 , production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, were $10.3 million &#32;compared to $13.5 million and $13.7 million for the years ended 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. On a unit-of-production basis, production expenses, including ad valorem taxes, were $3.19 &#32;per boe in 2015 compared to $2.48 and $2.14 per boe in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Production Taxes. &#32;For the year ended December 31, 2015 , production taxes were a nominal amount compared to $2.9 million and $2.5 million for the years ended 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. On a unit-of-production basis, production taxes were $0.01 &#32;per boe in 2015 compared to $0.54 per boe in 2014 and $0.39 per boe in 2013 . The decrease in production taxes from 2014 and 2015 was primarily due to lower prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL and severance tax exemptions related to economically at risk wells for prior periods that were realized in 2015. 

The Reserve Report for the Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests 

The oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in this Annual Report were estimated by Ryder Scott. The process to review and estimate the reserves begins with Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Department collecting and verifying all pertinent data, including but not limited to well test data, production data, historical pricing, cost information, property ownership interests, reservoir data, and geosciences data. This data is reviewed by various levels of Chesapeake management for accuracy before consultation with Ryder Scott. Ryder Scott was consulted with regularity during the reserve estimation process to review properties, assumptions, and any new data available. Internal reserve estimates and methodologies are compared to Ryder Scott's estimates and methodologies to test the reserve estimates and conclusions before the reserve estimates are included in this Annual Report. Additionally, Chesapeake's senior management reviews and approves the reserve report contained herein. 

Internal Controls . Chesapeake's Director - Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Trust's reserve estimates. His qualifications include the following: 

&#8226; 

25 years of practical experience working for major oil companies, including 17 years in reservoir engineering responsible for estimation and evaluation of reserves; 

&#8226; 

Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering; 

&#8226; 

registered professional engineer in the state of Texas; and 

&#8226; 

member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 

Chesapeake ensures that the key members of Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Department have appropriate technical qualifications to oversee the preparation of reserves estimates. Each of Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Advisors has more than 25 years' experience in reserve estimation as a reservoir engineer. Each of its engineering technicians has a minimum of a four-year degree in mathematics, economics, finance or other technical/business/science field. Chesapeake also maintains a continuous education program for its engineers and technicians on new technologies and industry advancements and offer refresher training on basic skill sets. 

Chesapeake maintains internal controls such as the following to ensure the reliability of reserves estimations: 

&#8226; 

Chesapeake follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies to estimate and report proved reserves. Reserves estimates are made by experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision. All material changes are reviewed and approved by Chesapeake's Corporate Reserve Advisors. 

&#8226; 

Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Department reviews all of Chesapeake's and the Trust's proved reserves at the close of each quarter. 

&#8226; 

Each quarter, Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Department managers, the Director - Corporate Reserves, the Vice Presidents of its business units, the Director of Corporate and Strategic Planning and the Executive Vice Presidents of its operating divisions review all significant reserves changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions. 

&#8226; 

Chesapeake's Corporate Reserves Department reports independently of Chesapeake's operating divisions. 

&#8226; 

the five year PUD development plan is reviewed and approved annually by Chesapeake's Director of Corporate Reserves and the Director of Corporate and Strategic Planning. 

&#160; Technologies . The reserve report was prepared using decline curve analysis to determine the reserves of individual Producing Wells. After estimating the reserves of each proved developed well, it was determined that a reasonable level of certainty exists with respect to the reserves that can be expected from close offset undeveloped wells in the field. The continuity of the play across the AMI area was established by reviewing electronic well logs from wells, geologically mapping the analogous reservoir and reviewing extensive production data from horizontal wells within the larger Colony Granite Wash area. The proved undeveloped locations within the AMI are direct offsets to the horizontal wells drilled and producing as of December 31, 2015 . 

Ryder Scott . Ryder Scott, the independent petroleum engineering consultant, estimated all of the proved reserve information in this Annual Report, in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC to conform with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas. For purposes of the reserve report, a copy of which is filed with this Annual Report as Exhibit 99.1, Ryder Scott used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. The reserves in the reserve report have been estimated using such deterministic methods. Ryder Scott used standard engineering and geosciences methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis and analogy, that they considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. A substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations and producing wells that lack sufficient production history upon which performance-related estimates of reserves can be based. Therefore, these reserves are based on estimates of reservoir volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. Ryder Scott's expertise is in petroleum engineering, geoscience, and petrophysical interpretation, not legal or accounting matters; they are not accountants, attorneys, or landmen. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data; therefore, the conclusions from Ryder Scott necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. The titles to the properties have not been examined by Ryder Scott, nor has the actual degree or type of interest owned been independently confirmed. The data used in Ryder Scott's estimates were obtained from Chesapeake and the non-confidential files of Ryder Scott and were accepted as accurate. Supporting geoscience, field performance, and work data are on file in their office. The qualifications of the technical person at Ryder Scott primarily responsible for overseeing the estimate of the reserves include: 

&#8226; 

over 30 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves; 

&#8226; 

registered professional engineer in the state of Texas; 

&#8226; 

member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers; and 

&#8226; 

Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. 

These qualifications meet or exceed the Society of Petroleum Engineers standard requirements to be a professionally qualified Reserve Estimator and Auditor. Ryder Scott are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; Ryder Scott does not own an interest in these properties and are not employed on a contingent basis.
