&#160; BUSINESS. 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Previously HDS International, Inc. (the "Company", "we", or "us") was a green technology company providing renewable energy and eco-sustainability solutions as well as an emergency management solutions company. On February 18, 2016, we changed the focus of our business to become a leading tournament gaming platform and online destination targeting the over 205 million eSports players and participants worldwide that want to compete at the high school or college level. We are a developmental stage business, have not generated any revenues to date and have a history of operating losses. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated November 3, 2008 under the laws of the State of Nevada, to engage in providing certain business services. 

&#160; 

On August 16, 2011, we entered into an Asset Acquisition Agreement (the "Agreement") with Hillwinds Ocean Energy, LLC, a privately held consulting company ("HOEL"), under which we acquired from HOEL certain of HOEL's assets, including a certain license relating to technologies for gas exchange, carbon dioxide capture and sequestration, algae biomass production and other renewable energy and eco- sustainability applications. 

&#160;

On December 10, 2012, through our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, HDS Energy and Ecosystems NB, Ltd., we entered into a new technology license agreement with HEDC, which expands the geographic territory under our previous technology licenses. All previous license agreements between HDS and HEDC, including the license under asset acquisition agreement dated August 15, 2011, and the intellectual property agreement consummated October 7, 2011 (dated September 2, 2012) have been terminated and superseded in their entirety by the new license agreement (the "NB Provincial License"). 

&#160;

On March 5, 2015, we reached settlement and general mutual release agreements (the "General Release Agreements") with Tassos Recachinas, our at-the-time President &#38; CEO; Alexander Chirkov, our Chief Scientist for renewable energy and eco-sustainability technologies; and a consultant under renewable energy and eco-sustainability technologies; under which we and these three independent parties agreed to settle any and all amounts owing to them under prior employee and consulting agreements, by converting all amounts owing (amounting to $215,225, $684,500, and $49,000, respectively, or in the aggregate, $948,725) as accrued and disclosed on our balance sheet, in exchange for 74,235,000, 74,235,000, and 31,815,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock, respectively, eliminating these liabilities from our balance sheet. 

&#160;

On March 9, 2015, we closed a Strategic Expansion Agreement, dated March 5, 2015 (the "Strategic Expansion Agreement") and entered into by and between us; Hillwinds Ocean Energy, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company ("HOEL"), which was formerly our controlling shareholder; and SirenGPS, Inc. a Delaware corporation ("SirenGPS"). At that time we changed the focus of our business from the development of renewable energy and eco-sustainability technologies to emergency management software. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Strategic Expansion Agreement, we entered into a global technology license agreement (the "E911 License Agreement") granting us certain rights to that certain technology owned and controlled by SirenGPS relating to emergency management, emergency communication, emergency response, enhanced emergency calling and related technologies. In exchange, SirenGPS received: (a) thirteen million three hundred fifty thousand (13,350,000) newly-issued shares of HDS International Corp. Class B Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "New HDSI Class B Preferred Stock"), (b) two hundred million (200,000,000) newly-issued restricted shares of our common stock (the "Transaction Shares") and (c) seven million five hundred thousand (7,500,000) shares of HDS International Corp. Class A Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share, from HOEL (the "Transferred Class A Preferred Stock). Pursuant to the terms of the Strategic Expansion Agreement, the Company also issued 274,300 newly-issued shares of Class B Preferred Stock to a designee of SirenGPS. 

&#160; 

On April 1, 2015, we entered into a transaction with Iconic Holdings, LLC (the "Purchaser"), whereby Iconic Holdings agreed to provide up to $600,000 through a structured convertible promissory note (the "Note"), with funds to be received in tranches. The note bears interest of 10% and is due April 1, 2016. The initial proceeds of $40,000 was received on April 9, 2015, with $30,000 remitted and delivered to us, $4,000 retained by the Purchaser as an original issue discount, and $6,000 retained by the Purchaser for legal expenses. The Purchaser had the right to convert the outstanding principal amount and interest under the Note in whole or in part into shares of common stock at a price equal to 50% of the average of the lowest three end of day closing prices of the Company's common stock during the 25 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which Holder elects to convert all or part of the Note.

After 180 days from the date of execution until the Due Date, the Note may not be prepaid without written consent from the Purchaser. This agreement was terminated through a settlement and restructuring agreement with the Purchaser in February 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On April 1, 2015, we consented to the further assignment of the February 18, 2014 and the October 4, 2013 Asher Notes, which were initially assigned to JABRO. The April 8, 2015 assignment assigned the notes to the Purchaser. According to the terms of the April 8, 2015 assignment agreement, the February 18, 2014 note was sold to the Purchaser and simultaneously exchanged for a new note (the "New February Note"). In accordance with the exchange, The New February Note was deemed to have been issued February 18, 2014, and carried substantially the same terms as the original note, with the following exceptions: the New February Note bears 0% interest, and the overall ownership of the Purchaser at any one moment shall be limited to 9.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.

&#160;

&#160; 

On February 18, 2016, the Company acquired Good Gaming, Inc. from CMG Holdings Group, Inc. (OTCQB: CMGO). On that date, the Company&#8217;s former CEO, Paul Rauner, resigned. And the Company appointed Vik Grover to the positions of CEO and Director. Vik Grover is a former Wall Street analyst and investment banker with 20 years' experience in telecommunications, media and technology. In addition, Barbara Laken and David Dorwart were elected by the majority shareholders to the Company's Board of Directors. Ms. Laken is a former teacher, with experience creating specialized formats for advanced placement and special needs programs, with emphasis on systems management and curriculum development. A published novelist and co-author of an optioned screenplay. Mr. Dorwart is the Co-Founder and Chairman of Assist Wireless, Inc., a provider of lifeline wireless services to tens of thousands of subscribers primarily in the Midwest. 

&#160;

&#160; On May 4, 2016 the Company announced that it has completed its first closed public beta testing of their 2.0 tournament platform to determine the functionality, speed, ease of use, and accuracy of the system and are preparing to enter into full-blown production. 

&#160;

The Good Gaming platform was established in early 2014 by the founding members who had recognized the need that hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide have a desire to play games at a competitive level. The founders recognized that while professional eSports was quickly establishing itself, there were no structure or organizations on a large scale for amateur gamers. 

&#160;

Good Gaming is effectively building the equivalent infrastructure of High School and College Athletics for the rapidly growing eSports industry. Good Gaming is designed to be the gateway for amateur eSports athletes to compete at the semi-professional level, improve their gaming skills, and interact with veteran gamers globally in a destination site and social networking framework. 

&#160;

Good Gaming differs from the professional level of eSports industries by focusing on the 205 million plus gamers that fall below the professional level and above the casual gamer, classified as &#8220;amateurs&#8221;. Good Gaming also differs from other direct and indirect competitors by being the first to offer multi-game, multi-console services at the amateur eSports level. The Company is not exclusive to any one vendor of hardware or software titles. 

&#160;

Good Gaming held one of the largest pay-to-play online tournaments in history in December 2014 based on Activision Blizzard&#8217;s title Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft . The tournament attracted 300,000 unique visitors, over 1,250+ paying members and increased overall memberships in Good Gaming from 1,000 to over 15,000 members. In 2015, the Company spent an entire year refining its platform and preparing for a more sustainable business plan that could infinitely scale. In 2016, the Company completed its 2.0 tournament platform and, as a result, has run dozens of robotic internal test tournaments and held numerous free-to-play tournaments of increasing size with its partner, The Syndicate, the owner of the world&#8217;s longest running online gaming guild with 1,200 members worldwide. Good Gaming also conducted two closed public beta tournaments of hundreds of participants in May 2016 in order to fully vet the system. After making roughly 100 fixes and changes to the system, it now runs flawlessly. The system is designed to scale to 512,000 concurrent competitors. 

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

With Good Gaming&#8217;s proprietary technology platform, which is based on the infinitely scalable and stress tested Yii framework geared for Web 2.0 development, Good Gaming will be able to offer publishers and vendors an innovative approach to gaming interactions. Currently there is no way for gamers to barter their skills and labor on the open market in a non-fragmented and less cumbersome process. As competitive gaming reaches critical mass, how gamers interact and barter their skills and labor will become critical if not the most economically lucrative endeavor. The &#8220;gamers&#8221; economy it expected to grow from tens of millions of dollars every year to multiple billions of dollars and the Good Gaming founders believe that we are rapidly approaching that time. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Good Gaming&#8217;s platform is modular and allows for easy integration of third party applications as well as tight integration into other existing systems. This framework allows for clans/teams/guilds to add functionality over time to include running their own tournaments leveraging the viral nature of the online communities. The Company is offering social networking functionality so gamers can interact, track each other, and communicate. Good Gaming also is completing a content suite to offer videos, blogs, and forums. Additionally, the Company intends to host multiple games online that subscribers to the site can play for free or for fees depending on their Good Gaming status/player level. 

&#160; 

Good Gaming has one patent filed for an online currency barter system (Mercenary System) that allows gamers across multiple games and multiple consoles the ability to trade items and labor in an efficient manner. The Company intends to file a patent for its 2.0 framework later this year, as it is based on proprietary coding that can handle more scope and scale than the legacy 1.0 patent filing. The market for these transactions will grow from a few hundred million dollars in 2014 to tens of billions of dollars by 2018. 

&#160; 

The Company intends to complete the 2.0 site during spring 2016, which will then allow it to go live offering pay-to-play and free-to-play tournaments for cash and prizes and offer gamers the premiere destination site for amateur eSports worldwide. In 2016, the Company intends to perfect is B2C model targeting gamers directly. In 2017, Good Gaming intends to launch a B2B program so other groups, including colleges, restaurants, bars et al. can offer their own tournaments using its platform. The Company also intends to work on a 3.0 system that will integrate with mobile networks and offer additional features to its customers.
