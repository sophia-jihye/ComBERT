 Item 1. Business 

BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS 

Overview 

We are a global apparel company that designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our owned Tommy Bahama&#174; and Lilly Pulitzer&#174; lifestyle brands, as well as certain licensed and private label apparel products. During Fiscal 2015, 91% of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own, and 66% of our net sales were sales of our products through our direct to consumer channels of distribution. In Fiscal 2015, more than 95% of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the United States, with the sales outside the United States primarily being sales of our Tommy Bahama products in Canada and the Asia-Pacific region. 

Our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers. We consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude. Furthermore, we believe that lifestyle brands like Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer, that create an emotional connection with consumers, can command greater loyalty, higher price points at retail and create licensing opportunities, which may result in higher earnings. We believe that the attraction of a lifestyle brand to consumers is dependent on creating compelling product, effectively communicating the respective lifestyle brand message and distributing the product to the consumer where and when they want it. 

Our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference, and presenting appealing products for consumers. Our design-led, commercially informed lifestyle brand operations strive to provide exciting, differentiated products each season. 

In order to further strengthen each lifestyle brand's connections with consumers, we communicate regularly with consumers via the use of electronic and print media. We believe that our ability to effectively communicate with consumers and create an emotional connection is critical to the success of the brands. 

We distribute our owned lifestyle branded products through our direct to consumer channel, consisting of our retail stores and e-commerce sites, and our wholesale distribution channel. Our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers, present to them the full line of our current season products and provide an opportunity for consumers to be immersed in the theme of the lifestyle brand. We believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands. Our 123 Tommy Bahama and 34 Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products, and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers, while also providing a platform for long-term growth for the brands. In Tommy Bahama, we also operate 16 &#32;restaurants, generally adjacent to Tommy Bahama full-price retail store locations, which we believe further enhance the brand's image with consumers. 

Additionally, our e-commerce websites, which represented 17% of our consolidated net sales in Fiscal 2015, provide the opportunity to increase revenues by reaching a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of products. Our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce flash clearance sales on our websites, as well as our 41 Tommy Bahama outlet stores, play an important role in overall brand and inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products in brand appropriate settings and at better prices than are typically available from third parties. 

The wholesale operations of our lifestyle brands complement our direct to consumer operations and provide access to a larger group of consumers. As we seek to maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by limiting promotional activity in our full-price retail stores and e-commerce websites, we generally target select wholesale customers that follow this same approach in their stores. Our wholesale customers for our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands include better department stores and specialty stores. 

Within our Lanier Apparel operating group, we sell tailored clothing and sportswear products under licensed brands, private label products and owned brands to department stores, national chains, warehouse clubs, discount retailers, specialty retailers and others throughout the United States. 

All of our operating groups operate in highly competitive apparel markets in which numerous U.S.-based and foreign apparel firms compete. No single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry and our direct 

competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation, value and image of brand names; design; consumer preference; price; quality; marketing; and customer service. 

The apparel industry is cyclical and very dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Often, negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel industry than these conditions may have on other industries. We believe the global economic conditions and resulting economic uncertainty that have prevailed in recent years continue to impact our business, and the apparel industry as a whole. Although some signs of economic improvements exist, the apparel retail environment remains increasingly more promotional. 

Additionally, the apparel retail market is evolving as a result of shifting shopping patterns and technological advances, with e-commerce playing an increasingly important role and bricks and mortar retail stores playing a different role in consumers' journey to their ultimate purchase. The industry is also being impacted by the coming of age of the millenial generation whose values and approach to the marketplace are so different from past generations. We believe that our lifestyle brands are ideally suited to succeed and thrive in the long-term while managing the various challenges facing our industry. 

Important factors relating to certain risks, many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict, which could impact our business are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. 

Investments and Opportunities 

We believe that our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer lifestyle brands have significant opportunities for long-term growth in their direct to consumer businesses through expansion of bricks and mortar retail store operations, as we add additional retail store locations and attempt to increase comparable retail store sales, and higher sales in our e-commerce operations, which are likely to grow at a faster rate than comparable bricks and mortar retail store sales. We also believe that these lifestyle brands provide an opportunity for moderate sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long-term primarily from current customers adding to their existing door count and the selective addition of new wholesale customers who generally follow a full-price retail model. We also believe that there are opportunities for modest sales growth for Lanier Apparel in the future through new product programs for existing and new customers. 

We believe that we must continue to invest in our Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer lifestyle brands in order to take advantage of their long-term growth opportunities. Investments include capital expenditures primarily related to the direct to consumer operations such as retail store and restaurant build-out and remodels, e-commerce initiatives, technology enhancements and distribution center and administrative office expansion initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate increased employment, advertising and other costs in key functions to support the ongoing business operations and fuel future sales growth. 

We continue to believe that it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We believe that positive cash flow from operations in the future coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity will provide us with sufficient resources to fund future investments in our owned lifestyle brands. While we believe that we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands, in the future, we may also add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio if we identify appropriate targets which meet our investment criteria. 

We believe that an attractive acquisition target would most likely be a lifestyle brand that has a strong emotional connection with its consumer and has a disciplined full-price distribution model consisting of wholesale customers who generally operate a full-price retail model and/or a direct to consumer distribution model via e-commerce or retail stores. Further, while both Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer are primarily apparel brands, we could also be interested in a company with a more significant footprint in accessories, footwear or other product categories. The acquisition of a premier lifestyle brand is a meticulous process as such a brand is not available very often, and we most likely would have stiff competition from both strategic and private equity firms. 

Operating Groups 

Our business primarily operates through our Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Lanier Apparel operating groups, each of which is described below. We identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Our operating group structure reflects a brand-focused management approach, emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across each brand's direct to consumer, wholesale and licensing operations. 

In Fiscal 2015, as a result of certain organizational and management reporting changes, our Oxford Golf operations, which were previously included in Corporate and Other, are considered part of and included in our Lanier Apparel operating group. For all periods presented, amounts for Lanier Apparel include the Oxford Golf operations, while amounts for Corporate and Other exclude those operations. Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of other businesses which are not included in our operating groups.

Tommy Bahama 

Tommy Bahama designs, sources, markets and distributes men's and women's sportswear and related products. The target consumers of Tommy Bahama are primarily affluent men and women age 35 and older who embrace a relaxed and casual approach to daily living. Tommy Bahama products can be found in our Tommy Bahama stores and on our Tommy Bahama e-commerce website, tommybahama.com, as well as in better department stores and independent specialty stores throughout the United States. We also operate Tommy Bahama restaurants and license the Tommy Bahama name for various product categories. During Fiscal 2015 , 95% of Tommy Bahama's sales were to customers within the United States, with the remaining sales being in Canada, Australia and Asia. 

We believe that the attraction of the Tommy Bahama brand to our consumers is a reflection of our efforts over many years of maintaining appropriate quality and design of our Tommy Bahama apparel, accessories and licensed products, limiting 

the distribution of Tommy Bahama products to a select tier of retailers and effectively communicating the relaxed and casual Tommy Bahama lifestyle to consumers. We expect to continue to follow this approach for the brand in the future. We believe that the retail sales value of all Tommy Bahama branded products sold during Fiscal 2015 , including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers, was approximately $1.2 billion. 

We believe there is ample opportunity to expand the reach of the Tommy Bahama brand, while at the same time maintaining the select distribution that Tommy Bahama has historically maintained. We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Tommy Bahama brand both domestically and internationally. These investments include amounts associated with capital expenditures and pre-opening expenses of new stores and restaurants; the remodeling of existing stores and restaurants; capital expenditures and ongoing expenses to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities; and capital expenditures related to distribution and other facilities. 

We believe there are abundant opportunities for continued growth in the United States through direct to consumer expansion as well as developing a more significant women's business in the long-term. During Fiscal 2015, Tommy Bahama's women's business represented 29% of Tommy Bahama's full-price direct to consumer sales but a much lower percentage of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales. In recent years we began expansion of the Tommy Bahama brand into international markets. These efforts have included the acquisition of the assets and operations of the Tommy Bahama business from our former licensees in Australia in Fiscal 2012 and Canada in Fiscal 2013. The operations of these licensees in each of these countries had developed a certain level of brand awareness, but we determined that after considering the potential direct to consumer and wholesale growth opportunities in those countries, it was appropriate for us to re-acquire the rights to the operations. 

We also commenced operations in Asia by opening retail store locations in Asia beginning in Fiscal 2012. The operations in Asia thus far have generated operating losses as we developed a significant Hong Kong-based team and infrastructure to support a larger Asia retail operation. The roll-out of retail stores in Asia has been at a modest pace as we have attempted to focus on improving store operations in Asia prior to engaging in a significant roll-out of additional stores. As a lifestyle brand which desires to remain primarily a full-price brand, we continue to believe it is appropriate that in certain key markets we initially set the tone for the brand rather than engaging a partner. However, in the future, we may engage a local partner to accelerate growth in markets that we have not yet entered, as well as in markets that we are currently operating. 

Our near term focus in the Asia-Pacific region remains on our direct to consumer operations in Australia and Japan while at the same time further reducing our infrastructure costs in Hong Kong to better align with our current Asia retail operations. During Fiscal 2015, at the expiration of the respective leases, we closed our retail store in Macau and outlet store in Hong Kong, and we also plan on closing our store in Singapore in Fiscal 2016. These closures will result in our Asia-Pacific retail operations primarily consisting of stores in Australia and Japan. By focusing on Australia and Japan and increasing the store count in those locations, as appropriate, we believe we can do a better job of increasing brand awareness and sales by focusing our marketing spend in a location where the consumer has a variety of options for purchasing Tommy Bahama product, including our own retail stores, our wholesale customers' stores and, in the case of Japan, an in-country Tommy Bahama website. While we believe there are significant long-term opportunities for our Tommy Bahama operations in the Asia-Pacific region, we believe that the operating losses associated with these operations will continue to put downward pressure on our operating margin in the near future until we have sufficient sales to leverage the operating costs. 

Design, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution 

Tommy Bahama products are designed by product specific teams who focus on the target consumer. The design process includes feedback from buyers, consumers and sales agents, along with market trend research. Our Tommy Bahama apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton, silk, linen, nylon, leather, tencel and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 

We operate a buying office located in Hong Kong to manage the production and sourcing of the substantial majority of our Tommy Bahama products. During Fiscal 2015 , we utilized more than 250 suppliers to manufacture our Tommy Bahama products. In Fiscal 2015 , 77% of Tommy Bahama's product purchases were from manufacturers in China. The largest 10 suppliers of Tommy Bahama products provided 48% of the products acquired during Fiscal 2015 , with no individual supplier providing greater than 10%. 

We believe that advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy of the Tommy Bahama brand, and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing. While the advertising for Tommy Bahama promotes our products, the primary emphasis is on brand image and brand lifestyle. We intend that Tommy Bahama's advertising will engage individuals within the brand's consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our retail stores, e-commerce websites or wholesale customers' stores in search of our products. The marketing of the Tommy Bahama brand includes email, Internet and social media advertising and traditional media such as catalogs, print and other correspondence with customers, as well as moving media and trade show initiatives. As a lifestyle brand, we believe that it is very important that Tommy Bahama 

communicate regularly with consumers via the use of email, Internet and social media about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen Tommy Bahama's connections with its consumers. 

We also believe that highly visible retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit our retail stores and buy merchandise. We intend that our retail stores enhance the shopping experience of our customers, which we believe will increase consumer brand loyalty. Marketing initiatives at our retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our products including promotional gift cards and "flip-side" events intended to drive traffic to our stores and websites. We believe our traditional and electronic media communications increase the sales of our own retail stores and e-commerce operations, as well as the sales of our products for our wholesale customers. 

For certain of our wholesale customers, we also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. 

We operate a Tommy Bahama distribution center in Auburn, Washington, which serves our North American direct to consumer and wholesale operations. Activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to our Tommy Bahama stores, our wholesale customers and our e-commerce customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of Tommy Bahama inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked orders and some limited replenishment ordering for our wholesale customers. We use local third party distribution centers for our Asia-Pacific operations. 

Direct to Consumer Operations 

A key component of our Tommy Bahama growth strategy is to operate our own stores and e-commerce websites, which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based. Our Tommy Bahama direct to consumer channels, which consist of retail store, e-commerce and restaurant operations, in the aggregate, represented 76% of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2015 . We expect the percentage of our Tommy Bahama sales which are direct to consumer sales will increase slightly in future years as we anticipate that the direct to consumer distribution channel will grow at a faster pace than the wholesale distribution channel. Retail store, e-commerce and restaurant net sales accounted for 50% , 15% &#32;and 11% , respectively, of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2015 . 

Our direct to consumer strategy for the Tommy Bahama brand includes locating and operating full-price retail stores in upscale malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand appropriate street locations. Generally, we seek shopping areas and malls with high-profile or upscale consumer brands for our full-price retail stores. As of January 30, 2016 , approximately 40% of our full-price Tommy Bahama retail locations were in regional malls, with the remainder primarily being stores in street-front locations or lifestyle centers. Our full-price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise, including apparel, home products and accessories, all presented in an aspirational, island-inspired atmosphere designed to be relaxed, comfortable and unique. We believe that the Tommy Bahama retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products, and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers. Further, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the retail stores as full-price stores with limited in-store promotional activities are good for the Tommy Bahama brand and, in turn, enhance business with our wholesale customers. Generally, we believe there are opportunities for retail stores in warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting. 

Our Tommy Bahama outlet stores, which generated 10% of our total Tommy Bahama net sales in Fiscal 2015 , are generally located in outlet shopping centers that include upscale retailers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties. We believe that this approach helps us protect the integrity of the Tommy Bahama brand by allowing our full-price retail stores to limit promotional activity and controlling the distribution of discontinued and out-of-season product. To supplement the clearance items sold in Tommy Bahama outlets, approximately 20% of the product sold in our Tommy Bahama outlets was made specifically for our outlets. At this time and based on our anticipated proportion of clearance versus made-for items in our outlet stores, we anticipate that we would generally operate one outlet for approximately every three full-price stores. 

For Tommy Bahama's domestic full-price retail stores and restaurant-retail locations operating for the full Fiscal 2015 year, sales per gross square foot, excluding restaurant sales and restaurant space, were approximately $655 during Fiscal 2015 , compared to $680 for stores operating for the full Fiscal 2014 year. The decrease in sales per square foot was primarily due to Fiscal 2014 store openings having a lower sales per square foot than the overall average and unfavorable domestic comparable store sales for stores opened prior to Fiscal 2014. For international full-price retail stores and restaurant-retail locations located in Canada, Australia and Asia operating for the full Fiscal 2015 &#32;year, sales per gross square foot, excluding 

restaurant sales and restaurant space, were approximately $410 during Fiscal 2015 . In Fiscal 2015 , our domestic outlet stores and international outlet stores generated approximately $380 and $255 of sales per square foot, respectively, for outlets open for the entire 2015 fiscal year. 

As of January 30, 2016 &#32;we operated 16 &#32;restaurants, generally adjacent to a Tommy Bahama full-price retail store location, which together we often refer to as islands. These restaurant-retail locations provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate Tommy Bahama experience. We do not anticipate that many of our retail locations will have an adjacent restaurant; however, in select high-profile, brand appropriate locations, such as Naples and Jupiter, Florida, Waikiki, Hawaii, and New York City, we have determined that an adjacent restaurant can further enhance the image of the brand. The net sales per square foot in our domestic full-price retail stores which are adjacent to a restaurant are on average two times the sales per square foot of our domestic full-price retail stores not adjacent to a restaurant. We believe that the experience of a meal or drink in a Tommy Bahama restaurant may entice the customer to purchase additional Tommy Bahama merchandise and potentially provide a memorable consumer experience that further enhances the relationship between Tommy Bahama and the consumer. 

As of January 30, 2016 , the total square feet of space utilized for our Tommy Bahama full-price retail store and outlet store operations was 0.6 million with another 0.1 million of total square feet utilized in our Tommy Bahama restaurant operations. The table below provides certain information regarding Tommy Bahama retail stores operated by us as of January 30, 2016 . &#32; &#160;

In future years, we currently expect to open approximately seven to 10 retail locations per year, however, recently we have opened more than this stated pace. The operation of full-price retail stores, outlet stores and restaurant-retail locations requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We 

estimate that we will spend approximately $1.0 million on average in connection with the build-out of a domestic full-price retail store. However, individual locations, particularly those in urban locations, may require investments greater than these amounts depending on a variety of factors, including the location and size of the store. The cost of a restaurant-retail location is significantly more than the cost of a retail store and can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. Historically, the cost of our restaurant-retail locations has been approximately $5 million; however, we have spent significantly more than that amount for certain locations, including New York City and Waikiki. For most of our stores, the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. 

We also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store. The cost of store relocations is generally comparable to the costs of opening a new full-price retail store or outlet store. Additionally, we incur capital expenditure costs related to periodic remodels of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. When a lease expires we may decide to close the store rather than relocating the store to another location or renewing the lease. As we reach the expirations of more of our lease agreements in the near future, we anticipate that the capital expenditures for relocations and remodels, in the aggregate, may increase in future periods. 

In addition to our full-price retail stores and outlet stores, our direct to consumer approach includes various e-commerce websites, including the tommybahama.com website and the tommybahama.jp website, which launched in February 2015. During Fiscal 2015 , e-commerce sales represented 15% &#32;of Tommy Bahama's net sales. Our Tommy Bahama websites allow consumers to buy Tommy Bahama products directly from us via the Internet. These websites also enable us to increase our database of consumer contacts, which allows us to communicate directly and frequently with consenting consumers. As we reach more customers in the future, we anticipate that our e-commerce distribution channel for Tommy Bahama will continue to grow at a faster pace than our domestic retail store operations or wholesale operations. Also, we expect to continue to have a select number of e-commerce flash clearance sales, which represented 9% of Tommy Bahama e-commerce sales in Fiscal 2015 , using our outlettommybahama.com website as a means of complementing our outlets in liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory, in a brand appropriate manner. 

Wholesale Operations 

To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, including those who may wish to shop at specialty stores or department stores, we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for Tommy Bahama. Tommy Bahama's wholesale customers consist of sales to better department stores and specialty stores that generally follow a full-price retail model approach with limited discounting. We value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Tommy Bahama brand within their stores. We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Tommy Bahama brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Tommy Bahama products are sold. 

As a result of this approach to limiting our wholesale customers, we believe that sales growth in our men's apparel wholesale business, which represented approximately 86% of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2015 , may be somewhat limited domestically. However, we believe that we have significant opportunities for wholesale sales increases for our Tommy Bahama women's business, which represented approximately 14% of Tommy Bahama's wholesale sales in Fiscal 2015 . Overall, we expect that the Tommy Bahama wholesale business will grow at a slower rate than the direct to consumer distribution channel. 

Wholesale sales for Tommy Bahama accounted for 24% &#32;of Tommy Bahama's net sales in Fiscal 2015 . Approximately two-thirds of of Tommy Bahama's wholesale business reflects sales to major department stores with the remaining wholesale sales primarily being sales to specialty stores. Tommy Bahama products are available in more than 2,000 retail locations. During Fiscal 2015 , 15% of Tommy Bahama's net sales were to Tommy Bahama's five largest wholesale customers, with its largest customer representing 6% of Tommy Bahama's net sales. 

We maintain Tommy Bahama apparel sales offices and showrooms in New York and Seattle, as well as other locations, to facilitate sales to our wholesale customers. Our Tommy Bahama wholesale operations utilize a sales force predominantly consisting of independent commissioned sales representatives. 

Licensing Operations 

We believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for the Tommy Bahama brand. For an established lifestyle brand, licensing typically requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a licensee for Tommy Bahama, we typically consider the candidate's experience, financial stability, sourcing expertise and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with other Tommy Bahama products. 

Our agreements with Tommy Bahama licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future, and in limited cases include contingent renewal options. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as additional royalty payments and, in some cases, advertising payments and/or obligations to expend certain funds towards marketing the brand on an approved basis calculated as specified percentages of the licensee's net sales of the licensed products. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution. Third party license arrangements for our Tommy Bahama products include the following product categories: Men's and women's headwear 

Ceiling fans 

Indoor furniture 

Men's socks 

Rugs 

Outdoor furniture and related products 

Mattresses 

Fabrics 

Bedding and bath linens 

Sleepwear 

Belts, leather goods and gifts 

Table top accessories 

Shampoo, soap and bath amenities 

Luggage 

Suncare products 

&#160; 

Fragrances 

&#160; 

In addition to our licenses for the specific product categories listed above, we may enter into certain international distributor agreements which allow those parties to distribute Tommy Bahama apparel and other products on a wholesale and/or retail basis within certain countries or regions. As of January 30, 2016 , we have one such agreement for the Middle East. Substantially all of the products sold by the distributor are identical to the products sold in our own Tommy Bahama stores. In addition to selling Tommy Bahama goods to wholesale accounts, the distributor operates its own retail stores. 

Seasonal Aspects of Business 

Tommy Bahama's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income for Tommy Bahama by quarter for Fiscal 2015 :

As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2015 &#32;are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. For example, in Fiscal 2015, Tommy Bahama's operating results in the third quarter were negatively impacted by increased occupancy costs associated with duplicate rent expense, moving costs and higher rent structure related to the relocation of Tommy Bahama's office in Seattle, Washington as well as substantial pre-opening rent and set-up costs associated with the Waikiki restaurant-retail location which opened in late October 2015. 

The timing of Tommy Bahama's sales in the direct to consumer and wholesale distribution channels generally varies. Typically, the demand in the direct to consumer operations, including sales at our own stores and e-commerce site, for Tommy Bahama products in our principal markets is generally higher in the spring, summer and holiday seasons and lower in the fall season. However, wholesale product shipments are generally shipped prior to each of the retail selling seasons. As the allocation of sales within a quarter is impacted by the seasonality of direct to consumer and wholesale sales, we have presented in the following table the proportion of net sales for each quarter represented by each distribution channel for Fiscal 2015 , which may not necessarily be indicative of the allocation of sales within any particular quarter in future periods:

Lilly Pulitzer 

Lilly Pulitzer designs, sources, markets and distributes upscale collections of women's and girl's dresses, sportswear and related products. The Lilly Pulitzer brand was originally created in the late 1950's by Lilly Pulitzer and is an affluent brand with a heritage and aesthetic based on the Palm Beach resort lifestyle. The brand is somewhat unique among women's brands in that it has demonstrated multi-generational appeal, including young women in college or recently graduated from college; young mothers with their daughters; and women who are not tied to the academic calendar. Lilly Pulitzer products can be found in our owned Lilly Pulitzer stores, in Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores, which are described below, and on our Lilly Pulitzer website, lillypulitzer.com, as well as in better department and independent specialty stores. During Fiscal 2015 , 45% and 37% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales were for women's sportswear and dresses, respectively, with the remaining sales consisting of Lilly Pulitzer accessories, including scarves, bags, jewelry and belts; children's apparel; footwear; and licensed products. 

We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, while at the same time maintaining the exclusive distribution that Lilly Pulitzer has historically maintained. We believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth, we must continue to invest in the Lilly Pulitzer brand. These investments include amounts associated with opening and operating new stores, costs to enhance e-commerce and other technology capabilities and an increase in employment, advertising and other costs to support a growing business. While we believe that these investments will generate long-term benefits, the investments may have a short-term negative impact on Lilly Pulitzer's operating margin. 

We believe the attraction of the Lilly Pulitzer brand to our consumers is a reflection of years of maintaining appropriate quality and design of the Lilly Pulitzer apparel, accessories and licensed products, restricting the distribution of the Lilly Pulitzer products to a select tier of retailers and effectively communicating the message of Lilly's optimistic Palm Beach resort chic lifestyle. We believe this approach to quality, design, distribution and communication has been critical in allowing us to achieve the current retail price points for Lilly Pulitzer products. We believe that the retail sales value of all Lilly Pulitzer branded products sold during Fiscal 2015 , including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers, but excluding sales associated with the one-time Target collaboration in April 2015, exceeded $275 million. 

Design, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution 

Lilly Pulitzer's products are developed by our dedicated design teams located at the Lilly Pulitzer headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania as well as Palm Beach, Florida. Our Lilly Pulitzer design teams focus on the target consumer, and the design process combines feedback from buyers, consumers and our sales force, along with market trend research. Lilly Pulitzer apparel products are designed to incorporate various fiber types, including cotton, silk, linen and other natural and man-made fibers, or blends of two or more of these materials. 

Lilly Pulitzer uses a combination of in-house employees in our King of Prussia and Hong Kong offices and third party buying agents primarily based in Asia to manage the production and sourcing of the Lilly Pulitzer apparel products. Through its buying agents and direct sourcing, Lilly Pulitzer used approximately 50 suppliers, with the largest individual supplier providing 13%, and the largest 10 suppliers providing 62%, of the Lilly Pulitzer products acquired during Fiscal 2015 . In Fiscal 2015 , 61% of Lilly Pulitzer's product purchases were from manufacturers located in China. 

We believe that advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long-term strategy of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing. We intend that Lilly Pulitzer's advertising will engage individuals within the brand's consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our retail stores, e-commerce websites and wholesale customers' stores in search of our products. The marketing of the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes email, Internet and social media advertising as well as traditional media such as catalogs, print and other correspondence with customers and moving media and trade show initiatives. We believe that it is very important that a lifestyle brand effectively communicate with consumers on a regular basis via the use of electronic media and print correspondence about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen the brand's connections with consumers. 

In addition to our ongoing Lilly Pulitzer marketing initiatives, we were also extremely pleased with a specific one-time marketing program in Fiscal 2015. This initiative was a single delivery design collaboration with the Target Corporation where Lilly Pulitzer provided certain designs and prints to Target, and Target used those prints on a collection of 250 pieces spanning apparel, accessories and shoes for women and girls, as well as home accents, outdoor entertaining accessories, beach gear and travel essentials. This single delivery program launched in April 2015 in all domestic Target locations and on the Target website. Target highlighted the collaboration in its marketing materials in connection with the launch. We did not recognize any product sales related to this program; however, this marketing program provided a significant amount of national exposure and media impressions for the Lilly Pulitzer brand. We believe that this marketing exposure introduced the Lilly Pulitzer brand to new consumers both on the East Coast where the brand has a very strong brand recognition and also west of the Mississippi River, where Lilly Pulitzer generated less than 20% of its Fiscal 2015 e-commerce sales. 

We believe that highly visible retail store locations with creative design, broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit our retail stores and buy merchandise. We intend that 

our retail stores enhance the shopping experience of our customers, which we believe will increase consumer brand loyalty. Marketing initiatives at certain of our retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our stores and products. At certain times during the year, an integral part of the marketing plan for Lilly Pulitzer includes certain gift with purchase programs where the consumer earns the right to a Lilly Pulitzer gift product if certain spending thresholds are achieved by the consumer. We believe that our retail store operations as well as our traditional and electronic media communications enhance brand awareness and increase the sales of Lilly Pulitzer products in all channels of distribution. 

For certain of our wholesale customers, we also provide point-of-sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our branded products at their retail locations and/or participate in cooperative advertising programs. 

Lilly Pulitzer operates a distribution center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for its operations. Activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers, inspecting the products and shipping the products to wholesale customers, Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores and our e-commerce customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations, as well as pre-booked orders and some limited replenishment ordering for our wholesale customers. 

Direct to Consumer Operations 

A key component of our Lilly Pulitzer growth strategy is to operate our own stores and e-commerce website which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which they are based. The distribution channels included in Lilly Pulitzer's direct to consumer strategy consist of full-price retail store and e-commerce operations and represented 68% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2015 , compared to 62% in Fiscal 2014 . We expect the percentage of our Lilly Pulitzer sales which are direct to consumer sales will increase in future years as we anticipate that the full-price retail and e-commerce components of the Lilly Pulitzer business will continue to grow at a faster rate than the wholesale distribution channel. 

Our direct to consumer strategy for the Lilly Pulitzer brand includes operating full-price retail stores in higher-end malls, lifestyle shopping centers, resort destinations and brand-appropriate street locations. Sales at our retail stores represented 38% &#32;of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales during Fiscal 2015 . As of January 30, 2016 , approximately one-half of the Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in indoor regional malls, approximately one-third of the Lilly Pulitzer stores were located in outdoor regional lifestyle centers and the remaining locations were primarily street locations. Each retail store carries a wide range of merchandise, including apparel, footwear and accessories, all presented in a manner intended to enhance the Lilly Pulitzer image, brand awareness and acceptance. Our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores allow us to present Lilly Pulitzer's full line of current season products. We believe our Lilly Pulitzer retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products and also enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. Also, we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the retail stores as full-price stores with limited promotional activities complement our business with our wholesale customers. Generally, we believe there are opportunities for retail stores in warmer and colder climates, as we believe the more important consideration is whether the location attracts the affluent consumer that we are targeting. 

Lilly Pulitzer's retail store sales per gross square foot for Fiscal 2015 &#32;were approximately $835 for the retail stores which were open the full Fiscal 2015 year compared to approximately $730 for the Lilly Pulitzer stores open for the full Fiscal 2014 year. The increase in sales per gross square foot from the prior year was primarily due to higher comparable store sales. The table below provides certain information regarding Lilly Pulitzer retail stores as of January 30, 2016 . &#160;

Open as of end of fiscal year 

In Fiscal 2016 , we expect to open six retail stores, and after Fiscal 2016, we expect to maintain a similar pace in the near future. The operation of full-price retail stores requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations, as well as greater ongoing operating costs. We anticipate that most future full-price retail store openings will generally be 2,500 square feet on average; however, many stores will be larger or smaller than 2,500 square feet with the determination of size of the store depending on a variety of criteria. To open a 2,500 square foot Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail store, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $0.8 million on average. For most of our retail stores, the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures. 

In addition to new store openings, we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels of existing stores, particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term, or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate. We may also incur capital expenditures if a lease expires, or otherwise, and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store. The cost of store relocations, if any, will generally be comparable to the cost of opening a new store. Alternatively, when a lease expires we may decide to close the store rather than relocating the store to another location or renewing the lease. In the First Quarter of Fiscal 2016, we closed our East Hampton, New York store at the expiration of the lease agreement. 

In addition to operating Lilly Pulitzer full-price retail stores, another key element of our direct to consumer strategy is the lillypulitzer.com website, which represented 30% &#32;of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2015 &#32;compared to 28% in Fiscal 2014 . The Lilly Pulitzer e-commerce business has experienced significant growth in recent years and we anticipate that the rate of growth of the e-commerce business will remain strong in the future. 

We also utilize the Lilly Pulitzer website as an effective means of liquidating discontinued or out-of-season inventory, which is an ongoing part of any apparel business, in a brand appropriate manner. Usually, we have two e-commerce flash clearance sales per year, both of which are in typical industry end of season promotional periods. These sales are brand appropriate events that create a significant amount of excitement with loyal Lilly Pulitzer consumers, who are looking for an opportunity to purchase Lilly Pulitzer products at a discounted price. Each of these two e-commerce flash clearance sales are for a very limited number of days, allowing the Lilly Pulitzer website to essentially remain full-price for the remainder of the year. During Fiscal 2015 , approximately 30% of Lilly Pulitzer's e-commerce sales were e-commerce flash clearance sales. 

Wholesale Operations 

To complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers, including those who may wish to shop at a specialty store or department store, we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer. These wholesale operations are with better department stores and specialty stores that generally follow a full-price retail model approach with limited discounting. During Fiscal 2015 , approximately 32% &#32;of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales were sales to wholesale customers. During Fiscal 2015 &#32;almost one-half of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale sales were to Lilly Pulitzer's Signature Stores, as described below, while approximately one-third of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale sales were to department stores. Lilly Pulitzer's net sales to its five largest wholesale customers represented 13% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales in Fiscal 2015 &#32;with its largest customer representing 5% of Lilly Pulitzer's net sales. 

An important part of Lilly Pulitzer's wholesale distribution is sales to Signature Stores. For these stores, we enter into agreements whereby we grant the other party the right to independently operate one or more stores as a Lilly Pulitzer Signature Store, subject to certain conditions, including designating substantially all the store specifically for Lilly Pulitzer products and adhering to certain trademark usage requirements. These agreements are generally for a two-year period. We sell products to these Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores on a wholesale basis and do not receive royalty income associated with these sales. As of January 30, 2016 , there were 71 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores. 

Although we do not expect that the Lilly Pulitzer wholesale business will grow at the same pace as the direct to consumer distribution channel, we value our long-standing relationships with our wholesale customers and are committed to working with them to enhance the success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand within their stores. We believe that the integrity and continued success of the Lilly Pulitzer brand, including its direct to consumer operations, is dependent, in part, upon controlled wholesale distribution with careful selection of the retailers through which Lilly Pulitzer products are sold. Lilly Pulitzer products are available in more than 600 retail locations. 

We maintain Lilly Pulitzer apparel sales offices and showrooms in Palm Beach, Florida; King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and New York City. Our wholesale operations for Lilly Pulitzer utilize a sales force consisting of salaried sales employees. 

Licensing Operations 

We license the Lilly Pulitzer trademark to licensees in categories beyond Lilly Pulitzer's core product categories. In the long-term, we believe licensing may be an attractive business opportunity for the Lilly Pulitzer brand, particularly once our direct to consumer presence has expanded. Once a brand is established, licensing requires modest additional investment but can yield high-margin income. It also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure. In evaluating a potential Lilly Pulitzer licensee, we consider the candidate's experience, financial stability, manufacturing performance and marketing ability. We also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with other Lilly Pulitzer brand products. 

Our agreements with Lilly Pulitzer licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future. Generally, the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty and advertising payments based on specified percentages of the licensee's net sales of the licensed products. Our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products, advertising and proposed channels of distribution. 

Third party license arrangements for Lilly Pulitzer products include the following product categories: bedding and home fashions; home furnishing fabrics; stationery and gift products; and eyewear. 

Seasonal Aspects of Business 

Lilly Pulitzer's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style as well as demand by distribution channel may vary significantly depending on the time of year.

As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales for Fiscal 2015 &#32;are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. 

The timing of Lilly Pulitzer's sales in the direct to consumer and wholesale distribution channels generally varies. Typically, the demand in the direct to consumer operations, including sales for our own stores and e-commerce sites, for Lilly Pulitzer products in our principal markets is generally higher in the spring, summer and resort seasons and lower in the fall season. However, wholesale product shipments are generally shipped prior to each of the retail selling seasons. Further, in the third quarter of our fiscal year, which has not historically been a strong direct to consumer or wholesale quarter for Lilly Pulitzer, Lilly Pulitzer has held a significant e-commerce flash clearance sale which results in e-commerce sales representing a larger percentage of total sales than in other fiscal quarters. As the allocation of sales within a quarter is impacted by the seasonality of direct to consumer and wholesale sales, we have presented in the following table the proportion of net sales for each quarter represented by each distribution channel for Fiscal 2015 , which may not necessarily be indicative of the allocation of sales by distribution channel in future periods:

Lanier Apparel 

During Fiscal 2015, our former Lanier Clothes operating group and Oxford Golf business, which was previously included in Corporate and Other, were combined into our Lanier Apparel group. We believe that this combination of the two businesses provides additional opportunities for growth for each of the businesses in the future. The Lanier Clothes business, an efficient operator that excels in sourcing, production, logistics, distribution and tailored clothing design, lacked an appropriate level of 

sportswear design expertise. At the same time the Oxford Golf business provides wonderful sportswear and golf designs for the Oxford Golf brand and private label customers, but lacked sufficient sales volume and relationships with large retailers. We believe the combination of the tailored clothing and Oxford Golf businesses provides excellent opportunities for the businesses to leverage their combined skills, which should allow for greater opportunities for sales growth and cost savings efficiencies in the future. 

Lanier Apparel designs, sources and distributes branded and private label men's apparel, including tailored clothing, casual pants and sportswear, across a wide range of price points, with the majority of the business at moderate price points. The majority of our Lanier Apparel products are sold under certain trademarks licensed to us by third parties. Licensed brands include Kenneth Cole&#174;, Dockers&#174;, Geoffrey Beene&#174; and Nick Graham&#174;. Additionally, we design and market products for our owned Billy London&#174; and Oxford Golf&#174; brands. Sales of branded products represented approximately 68% of Lanier Apparel's net sales during Fiscal 2015 . 

In addition to these branded businesses, Lanier Apparel designs and sources private label apparel products for certain customers, including a large private label pants program for a warehouse club. For our large retail customers, the private label programs offer the customer product exclusivity at generally higher gross margins than they would achieve on branded products, while allowing us the opportunity to leverage our design, sourcing, production, logistics and distribution infrastructure. For other customers, we may perform any combination of design, sourcing, production, logistics or distribution services for a brand owner who will then distribute the product acquired from us to their wholesale customers. In these cases, the brand owner may have determined it is more efficient to outsource the functions to Lanier Apparel, may be a small company that lacks such expertise given the brand's size or may want to focus their energies on the design aspect of their brand. 

Our Lanier Apparel products are sold to department stores, national chains, warehouse clubs, discount retailers, specialty retailers and others throughout the United States. Lanier Apparel's products are sold in more than 5,000 retail locations. In Lanier Apparel, we have long-standing relationships with some of the United States' largest retailers. During Fiscal 2015 , Lanier' Apparel's three largest customers represented 18%, 16% and 13% of Lanier Apparel's net sales, while sales to Lanier Apparel's 10 largest customers represented 78% of Lanier Apparel's net sales. The amount and percentage of net sales attributable to an individual customer in future years may be different than Fiscal 2015 &#32;amounts as sales are not tied to long-term contracts. 

As much of Lanier Apparel's private label sales are program based, where for each program or season Lanier Apparel must bid for a program, an individual customer could increase, decrease or discontinue its purchases from us at any time. Thus, significant fluctuations in Lanier Apparel's operating results from one year to the next may result, particularly if a program is not renewed, the customer decides to use another vendor, we determine that the return on the program is not acceptable to us, a new program is initiated, there is a significant increase in the volume of the program or otherwise. Additionally, in accordance with normal industry practice, as part of maintaining an ongoing relationship with certain customers, Lanier Apparel may be required to provide cooperative advertising or other incentives to the customer. 

The moderate price point tailored clothing and sportswear markets are extremely competitive sectors with significant competition at retail and gross margin pressures due to retail sales price pressures as well as product cost increases. We believe that our Lanier Apparel business has historically excelled at bringing quality products to our customers at competitive prices and managing inventory risk appropriately while requiring minimal capital expenditure investments. 

Design, Manufacturing, Sourcing, Marketing and Distribution 

We believe that superior customer service and supply chain management, as well as the design of quality products, are all integral components of our strategy in the branded and private label tailored clothing and sportswear markets in which Lanier Apparel operates. Our Lanier Apparel design teams, which are located in New York City and Atlanta, focus on the target consumer for each brand and product. The design process combines feedback from buyers and sales agents along with market trend research and input from manufacturers. Our various Lanier Apparel products are manufactured from a variety of fibers, including wool, silk, linen, cotton and other natural fibers, as well as synthetics and blends of these materials. 

Lanier Apparel manages production in Asia and Latin America through a combination of efforts from our Lanier Apparel offices in Atlanta and Hong Kong as well as with third party buying agents. Lanier Apparel's sourcing operations are also supplemented, as appropriate, by third party contractors who may provide certain sourcing functions or in-country quality assurance to further enhance Lanier Apparel's global sourcing operations. During Fiscal 2015 , 74% of Lanier Apparel's product purchases were from manufacturers located in Vietnam. Lanier Apparel purchased goods from approximately 150 suppliers in Fiscal 2015 . The 10 largest suppliers of Lanier Apparel provided 85% of the finished goods and raw materials Lanier Apparel acquired from third parties during Fiscal 2015 , with 26% of our product purchases being from our largest third party supplier. In addition to purchasing products from third parties in Vietnam, India and other countries, Lanier Apparel operates a manufacturing facility, located in Merida, Mexico, which produced 13% of our Lanier Apparel products during Fiscal 2015 . 

The advertising efforts of Lanier Apparel are much more product specific than advertising for our owned lifestyle brands. For Lanier Apparel's branded products, advertising primarily consists of cooperative advertising with our larger customers, contributions to the licensor based on a specified percentage of our net sales to fund the licensor's general brand advertising initiatives and attending brand appropriate trade shows. As a provider of private label apparel, we are generally not responsible for advertising for private label brands. 

For Lanier Apparel, we utilize a distribution center located in Toccoa, Georgia, a distribution center in Lyons, Georgia and certain third party distribution centers for our product shipments, where we receive goods from our suppliers, inspect those products and ship the goods to our customers. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support programs for pre-booked orders and to meet customer demand for at-once ordering. For certain standard product styles, we maintain in-stock replenishment programs, providing shipment to customers within just a few days of receiving the order. These types of programs generally require higher inventory levels. Disposal of excess prior-season inventory is an ongoing part of our business and Lanier Apparel utilizes various off-price retailers to sell such products. 

We maintain apparel sales offices and showrooms for our Lanier Apparel products in several locations, including New York City and Atlanta and employ a sales force consisting of a combination of salaried employees and independent sales reps. Lanier Apparel operates the billylondonuk.com, menstailoreddirect.com and oxfordgolf.com websites, where certain Lanier Apparel products may be purchased on-line directly by consumers. In addition, Lanier Apparel also ships certain products directly to consumers who purchase products from the websites of certain of its wholesale customers. 

Seasonal Aspects of Business 

Lanier Apparel's operating results are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style may vary significantly depending on the time of year. As a wholesale apparel business, in which product shipments generally occur prior to the retail selling seasons, the seasonality of Lanier Apparel generally reflects stronger spring and fall wholesale deliveries which typically occur in our first and third quarters; however, in some fiscal years this will not be the case due to much of Lanier Apparel's operations being program-driven businesses. The following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income for Lanier Apparel by quarter for Fiscal 2015 :

The timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, the introduction of new programs, the loss of programs or customers or other factors affecting the business may vary significantly from one year to the next. Therefore, we do not believe that net sales or operating income of Lanier Apparel for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2015 &#32;are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. 

Corporate and Other 

Corporate and Other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices, substantially all financing activities, elimination of inter-segment sales, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of other businesses which are not included in our operating groups, including our Lyons, Georgia distribution center operations, which performs warehouse and distribution services for third parties, as well as our Lanier Apparel business. LIFO inventory calculations are made on a legal entity basis which does not correspond to our operating group definitions; therefore, LIFO inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to operating groups. 

Discontinued Operations 

Discontinued operations include the assets and operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group which we sold in July 2015. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other information in this report reflect continuing operations and exclude any amounts related to the discontinued operations of our former Ben Sherman operating group. Refer to Note 12 in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about discontinued operations. 

TRADEMARKS 

As discussed above, we own trademarks, several of which are very important to our business. Generally, our significant trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on apparel and, in some cases, apparel-related products, accessories, home furnishings and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services. We 

continue to evaluate our worldwide usage and registration of certain of our trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services in the relevant jurisdiction and the required registration renewals are filed. Important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

PRODUCT SOURCING 

We intend to maintain flexible, diversified, cost-effective sourcing operations that provide high-quality apparel products. Our operating groups, either internally or through the use of third party buying agents, source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third party producers located in foreign countries, with a significant concentration in Asia, or from our licensees for licensed products sold in our direct to consumer distribution channels. During Fiscal 2015 , we sourced approximately 62% and 14% of our products from producers located in China and Vietnam, respectively, with no other country greater than 10%. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years, generally we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Instead, we conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Thus, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality, cost, timing of product delivery and other criteria while also utilizing the expertise of the manufacturers. During Fiscal 2015 , no individual third party manufacturer supplied more than 10% of our product purchases. 

We purchase substantially all of our products from third party producers as package purchases of finished goods, which are manufactured with oversight by us or our buying agents and to our design and fabric specifications. The use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us as operating manufacturing facilities can require a significant amount of capital investment. We depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials specified by us, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity rather than us providing or financing the costs of these items. We believe that purchasing substantially all of our products as package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we are not required to purchase, or finance the purchase of, the raw materials or other production costs related to our product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods, which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers. In addition to purchasing products from third parties, our Lanier Apparel operating group operates our only owned manufacturing facility, which is located in Merida, Mexico and produced 2% of our total company, or 13% of our total Lanier Apparel, products during Fiscal 2015 . 

As the design, manufacture and transportation of apparel products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season, we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our wholesale customers' stores. We continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customer. As our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e-commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors, and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to and purchased by us prior to the receipt of customer orders in some cases, we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than we will ultimately desire. 

As part of our commitment to source our products in a lawful and responsible manner, each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors that we purchase goods from, which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business or ethical standards, including related human rights, health, safety, working conditions, environmental and other requirements. We require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the applicable code of conduct or substantially similar compliance standards. On an ongoing basis we assess vendors' compliance with the applicable code of conduct and applicable laws and regulations through audits performed by either our employees or our designated agents. This assessment of compliance by vendors is directed by our corporate leadership team. In the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by our required standards, we work with the vendor to remediate the violation. If the violation is not satisfactorily remediated, we will discontinue use of the vendor. 

IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 

We are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations as almost all of our merchandise is manufactured by foreign suppliers. During Fiscal 2015 , we sourced approximately 62% of our products from producers located in China. Our imported products are subject to customs, trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the United States and other countries where we sell our products. 

Substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product and represent a component of the cost of the goods we sell. Duty rates vary depending on the type of garment and its fiber content and are subject to change in future periods. In addition, while the World Trade Organization's member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles, the United States and other countries into which we import our products are still 

allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose "anti-dumping" or "countervailing" duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries. 

In addition, apparel and other products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards, laws and other regulations. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, certification of product safety and importer security procedures. We believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to such regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations. 

Although we have not been materially inhibited from doing business in desired markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets. Our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment, including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products. 

Important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include, but are not limited to, those described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES 

We believe that sophisticated information systems and functionality are important components of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses, particularly in the ever changing consumer shopping environment. Our information systems are designed to provide effective retail store, e-commerce and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point-of-sale, distribution center, design, sourcing, order processing, marketing, customer relationship management, accounting and other functions. We regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies, to provide additional consumer access and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business. We believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency, functionality and reporting capabilities is critical to our operations and financial condition. 

SEASONAL ASPECTS OF BUSINESS 

Each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style, as well as by distribution channel, may vary significantly depending on the time of year. For details of the impact of seasonality on each of our operating groups, see the business discussion of each operating group above. The following table presents our percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter for Fiscal 2015 :

As the timing of certain unusual or non-recurring items, economic conditions, wholesale product shipments, weather or other factors affecting the retail business may vary from one year to the next, we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for Fiscal 2015 &#32;are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years. As an example, the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2015 was unfavorably impacted by the increased occupancy costs associated with duplicate rent expense, moving costs and higher rent structure related to the relocation of Tommy Bahama's office in Seattle, Washington as well as pre-opening rent and set-up costs associated with the the Tommy Bahama Waikiki retail-restaurant location. Our third quarter has historically been our smallest net sales and operating income quarter and that result is expected to continue as we continue the expansion of our retail store operations in the future. 

ORDER BACKLOG 

As 66% of our sales are direct to consumer sales, which are not reflected in an order backlog, and the order backlog for wholesale sales may be impacted by a variety of factors, we do not believe that order backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods. Therefore, we believe the order backlog is not material for an understanding of our business taken as a whole. Further, as our sales continue to shift towards direct to consumer rather than wholesale sales, the order backlog will continue to be less meaningful as a measure of our future sales and results of operations. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of January 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 5,500 persons, of whom approximately 90% were employed in the United States. Approximately 70% of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees. We believe our employee relations are good.
