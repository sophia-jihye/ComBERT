 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

We are a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries. Our primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber and satellite communications; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; conventional and renewable power generation; and industrial infrastructure. Our customers are primarily in these industries. Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for more than 85 &#32;years. We offer our services primarily under the MasTec service mark and, as of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 15,900 &#32;employees and 470 &#32;locations. We have been consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by Engineering News-Record for the past several years. 

We provide our services to a diversified base of customers. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Revenue from non-recurring, project specific work may experience greater variability than master service agreement work due to the need to replace the revenue as projects are completed. 

If we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization. We actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure. 

We have expanded and diversified our business in recent years, which has deepened our presence and broadened our service offerings in key markets, including: wireless services; natural gas, natural gas liquids and petroleum pipeline; and electrical transmission, among others. In addition, we seek to grow organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisition, in order to broaden our geographic presence and expand the services we provide within our traditional business areas, such as telecommunications, install-to-the-home and customer fulfillment services. For discussion of acquisitions in recent years, see Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business,&#8221; which is incorporated herein by reference. 

We manage our continuing operations under five operating segments, which represent our five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our labor-based construction services. 

The Communications segment performs engineering, construction and maintenance of communications infrastructure primarily related to wireless and wireline/fiber communications and install-to-the-home customers, and to a lesser extent, infrastructure for electrical utilities, among others. We perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries through our Oil and Gas segment. The Electrical Transmission segment primarily serves the energy and utility industries through the engineering, construction and maintenance of electrical transmission lines and substations. The Power Generation and Industrial segment primarily serves energy, utility and other end-markets through the installation and construction of conventional and renewable power facilities, related electrical transmission infrastructure, ethanol/biofuel facilities and various types of industrial infrastructure. The Other segment includes a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture, equity method investments and other small business units that perform construction services in a variety of international end-markets.

Industry Trends 

Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 

Demand for Wireless and Wireline/Fiber Communications Network Services 

Demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services has increased significantly with the continued expansion and proliferation of 4th generation (&#8220;4G&#8221;) wireless service and 1 Gigabit-per-second wireline high-speed internet connectivity, including mobile consumer and business device applications, data transmission, including two-way simultaneous transmission of video and voice data, video and music download services, high definition television, home security, home automation and other advanced data services. Data usage over wireless and wireline/fiber networks is rapidly increasing as new consumers enter the market and existing customers utilize more of these services. In its 2016 Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, Cisco Systems, Inc. predicted that global mobile data traffic will increase almost eight-fold by 2020, with an expected compound annual growth rate of over 50%. As a result, service providers continue to upgrade the capacity and performance of their communications networks and are deploying competing networks using new technologies to serve this developing market and the increasing need for faster data delivery services, including 4G technology for wireless communications and the deployment of higher speed fiber network technologies. Major carriers are also in the process of testing the next generation of 5G technology for future deployment. In addition to deployment of wireless networks, multiple incumbent as well as new entrants are devoting significant capital expenditures to upgrade wireline/fiber networks to 1-gigabit speeds. We expect these changing dynamics in the mobile and wireline/fiber data markets to create continuing opportunities for providers of wireless and wireline/fiber infrastructure construction services in all North American markets. 

Additionally, providers in the install-to-the-home market are seeking to expand their service offerings with opportunities in the areas of customer fulfillment, home security and home automation. We believe that we are one of the leading wireline, wireless, install-to-the-home and customer fulfillment contractors in North America and we expect to benefit from these trends. 

Demand for Pipeline Infrastructure 

Recent technological advances have significantly increased estimates of available North American oil and natural gas reserves. The resulting increase in production levels has significant implications for the construction of pipelines. According to the Department of Energy&#8217;s (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) Annual Energy Outlook 2015, increased levels of natural gas production could lead to the U.S. becoming a net exporter of natural gas by 2017. In addition to developments in the North American oil and gas sector, Mexico has revised its constitution and has adopted other legal measures to authorize and attract foreign investment in the energy sector in order to expand and revitalize Mexico&#8217;s energy industry. These initiatives call for a significant shift from fuel oils to more environmentally sensitive and cleaner natural gas. To accomplish this, Mexico has initiated a program for the long-term importation of natural gas from the U.S. to provide for cleaner and more economical electrical power generation and energy usage. Mexican utilities and other entities have recently awarded contracts to MasTec to construct pipelines to move natural gas to the Mexico / U.S. border, and we believe there will be additional pipeline infrastructure opportunities for the import of natural gas from the U.S. to Mexico and within Mexico. Mexico&#8217;s importation of inexpensive, reliable and cleaner burning natural gas could lead to a reduction in the cost of electricity, which could be a driving force behind growing economic developments and the creation of infrastructure construction opportunities in other areas, such as power generation, transmission and telecommunications. 

Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning hydrocarbon fuels and is in demand because of its relative cost advantage over other fossil fuel sources. Higher availability of low-cost natural gas supplies could substantially increase gas-fired electric generating plant additions, changing the North American fuel mix while increasing dependency on a single, largely domestic fuel type. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;NERC&#8221;) 2015 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, natural gas surpassed coal as the predominant fuel source in 2015 and is the leading fuel type for electric power generation. Although drilling and completion activities have been negatively affected by decreases in world oil prices, U.S. energy reserves have increased dramatically. As a result, expanded long-term opportunities for new and expanded pipelines are expected throughout North America. We also believe that U.S. energy policy goals will continue to promote domestic sources of energy in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources, both for economic and national security reasons. 

As result of these factors, the level of hydrocarbon pipeline construction activity in North America has grown significantly in the past several years. While the oil markets have experienced significant volatility from declining oil prices beginning in 2014, we believe that the global economy will continue to depend on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which we believe will generate continued opportunities for pipeline infrastructure in the future. 

We believe that we are one of the leading pipeline contractors in North America. Our service offerings include the construction and maintenance of large diameter (&#8220;long-haul&#8221;) pipeline, midstream pipeline, and to a lesser extent, gathering lines and related compressor and pumping stations and treatment plants. We anticipate that future demand for pipeline infrastructure in the North America and internationally should provide pipeline, power generation and heavy industrial construction opportunities and that our diverse capabilities and expertise in these sectors will enable us to continue to be a leading service provider in this market. 

Inadequacy of Existing Electrical Power Transmission and Distribution Networks 

The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures. Also, regional shifts in population and industry may also create pockets of demand for increased transmission and distribution construction and upgrades. Expected electrical grid expansions in Canada and Mexico may create additional opportunities for contractors that provide electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure services. According to the DOE&#8217;s Annual Energy Outlook 2015, approximately 300 gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity is expected to be added from through 2040, with an increase in electricity generation of almost 25%. Renewable energy generation projects, which are typically in remote areas, may require investment in new transmission lines to interconnect with the electrical grid. In addition, efforts to modernize, secure and visually improve the existing transmission system are expected. We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet these needs, and MasTec is well positioned in this sector. 

Renewable Energy Projects 

The recent governmental policy focus on a clean environment, coupled with recent clean air and climate change legislation, regulation and agreements, as well as the desire to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, have created demand for more domestic, environmentally sensitive electrical power production, such as wind and solar collection farms. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. The DOE&#8217;s Annual Energy Outlook 2015 projected approximately 97 gigawatts of new wind and solar capacity over the next ten years. In addition, according to NERC&#8217;s 2015 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, greenhouse gas emission regulations, the demand for energy efficiency and the projected continued decline in the cost of renewable resources are expected to continue to incentivize construction of renewable resources throughout North America. We have expertise in wind, solar and industrial plant construction and expect to continue to be a leading player in renewable energy infrastructure projects. 

The renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on federal and state tax incentives. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) extended certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which contains federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry. Currently, the tax code provides that the production tax credit for wind projects applies to qualifying projects for which the construction commencement date was prior to January 1, 2020. The credit will be reduced by 20% for 2017, by 40% for 2018, and finally will be reduced by 60% for 2019. Solar projects, however, will be eligible for an investment tax credit (the &#8220;Solar ITC&#8221;). The Solar ITC is 30% for projects commencing prior to 2020 and is reduced 

to 26% for projects commencing in 2020 and to 22% for projects commencing in 2021. Thereafter, the Solar ITC will permanently remain at 10%. Other tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry include accelerated tax depreciation provisions, including bonus depreciation, for certain renewable energy generation assets, such as equipment using solar or wind energy or energy from geothermal deposits or biomass. These incentives provide for a five-year depreciable life for qualifying assets rather than the longer depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. In addition to a shorter depreciable life, those assets qualifying for bonus depreciation benefit from significant allowable first-year depreciation. 

We believe that we are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America and we expect to benefit from these trends. 

See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors - The renewable energy industry is heavily reliant on tax incentives, the availability of which may be uncertain and could adversely affect demand for our services.&#8221; 

Heavy Industrial Opportunities 

Industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries. The low price of natural gas is expected to spur the construction of new gas-fired electrical generating plants, conversions of coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas and the construction of other plants which use natural gas as a fuel source or chemical feedstock. Industrial facilities and plants that support the biofuels, food processing, natural gas, petroleum and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 

Competitive Strengths 

Our competitive strengths include: 

Diverse Customer Relationships . We serve a diversified customer and industry base. Our customers include some of the largest communications, utility and power generation companies in North America.

Generally, key management personnel of acquired businesses continue to work for us under long-term employment or services agreements. 

Socially Responsible Investing 

We are committed to socially responsible investing and corporate practices. We are one of the largest renewables contractors in North America, having constructed a significant percentage of North America&#8217;s wind farms. Our renewables business also builds solar power plants. In our largest fleet operation, we developed sophisticated routing, scheduling and fuel management programs that significantly reduce our consumption of fuel. Additionally, we have recycling programs for discarded materials and programs for the proper disposition of hazardous wastes. In our Oil and Gas segment, we perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries. In many cases, we are helping consumers and customers access cleaner burning natural gas by providing transportation infrastructure for businesses and consumers that wish to switch to these cleaner burning and lower carbon fuel sources. We also provide state-of-the-art pipeline transportation options, which consume fewer hydrocarbons in the transportation process than do traditional truck and rail transport. 

We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with that of our shareholders. We believe that an independent, well-diversified Board makes us a better corporate citizen, and we have a Board with racial, ethnic, gender and skill diversity. We also believe that our separation of Chairman and CEO further enhances accountability and social responsibility. Our management team and our Board of Directors also have significant ownership in MasTec&#8217;s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders. 

We have detailed governance procedures, including an Audit Committee Charter, a Compensation Committee Charter and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, as well as a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Director and Communication Principles and Board of Director Governance Principles, all of which can reviewed on the &#8220;Investors&#8221; page of our website at MasTec.com. 

Strategy 

The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 

Focus on Growth Opportunities . &#32;&#32;We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect expansion of wireless and fiber optic network infrastructure, development of pipeline infrastructure, expansion and upgrades of electrical transmission capacity and the distribution grid, development of power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy sources, and heavy industrial projects to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 

Operational Excellence . We seek to improve our operating margins and cash flows by focusing on profitable services and projects that have high margin potential. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates, while continuing to maintain strong working capital management practices. We continue to pursue actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, hiring additional experienced operating and financial professionals and expanding and further integrating the use of our financial and other management information systems. 

Maintain Conservative Capital Structure . We evaluate our capital structure on an ongoing basis and have expanded our financial resources in recent years. We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations and have approximately $500 million &#32;of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we increased aggregate borrowing commitments under our senior secured credit facility to $1.25 billion from $750 million as of December 31, 2013. Additionally, $215 million principal amount of senior convertible notes matured in 2014. In 2013, we repurchased and redeemed $150 million principal amount of 7.625% senior notes due 2017 and issued $400 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023. We may consider opportunities to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase equity in the future as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for discussion of the share repurchase program we completed in April 2015. 

Leverage Performance and Core Expertise Through Strategic Acquisitions, Alliances and/or Selected Divestitures . &#32;&#32;We may pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that will allow us to expand our operations into targeted geographic areas or continue to expand our service offerings in related fields. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographical footprint through numerous acquisitions in the last few years. Our strategy includes timely and efficient integration of acquisitions to best fit into our internal control environment and to maximize the potential of acquired businesses. We may also divest certain businesses or assets due to their performance and/or fit within our long-term business strategy. 

Services 

Our core services are the engineering, building, installing, maintaining and upgrading of infrastructure for communications, utility and power generation customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 

Build . &#32;&#32;We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cable and power lines, which provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; natural gas, crude oil and refined product transport pipelines; electrical power generation, transmission and distribution systems; power generation infrastructure, including renewable energy; heavy industrial plants; and compressor and pump stations and treatment plants. 

Install . &#32;&#32;We install electrical and other energy distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic cables, coaxial cables, copper lines, satellite dishes, home security and home automation in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers&#8217; hardware, software and network equipment. 

Maintain and Upgrade . &#32;&#32;We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers&#8217; distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including natural gas and petroleum pipeline, communications, electrical distribution and transmission and power generation infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for accidents or storm damage. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls. 

Customers 

We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , 48% , 49% &#32;and 46% &#32;of our revenue, respectively, was derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements. 

The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, generally monthly or upon 

attaining specific milestones. Such contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% &#32;to 10% &#32;of the contract price is withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. 

We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 14 &#32;- Segments and Related Information and Note 15 &#32;- Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for significant customer concentrations. 

Backlog 

Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog includes amounts under master service and other service agreements in addition to construction projects and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue attributable to a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture. We determine the amount of backlog for work under master service and other service agreements based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. The following table presents 18-month backlog by reportable segment, as of the dates indicated:

We expect to realize approximately 80% &#32;of our year end 2015 &#32;backlog in 2016 . Our backlog estimates include amounts under master service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services; and most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Approximately 50% &#32;and 69% &#32;of our estimated backlog as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, represented amounts under master service or other service agreements. In the past, we have occasionally experienced a combination of cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements as a result of changes in current and planned spending for our wireless customers, as well as cancellations and deferrals of certain oil and gas projects, primarily in western Canada, due to volatility in the oil markets. There can be no assurance as to our customers&#8217; requirements or that our estimates are accurate. In addition, timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements and other project related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 

Backlog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers&#8217; demands. Through our unified MasTec &#174; &#32;brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor, equipment and materials, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec &#174; &#32;service mark and other service marks. 

We have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec &#174; &#32;registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate marketing organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 

Safety and Insurance/Risk Management 

We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. We have established a company-wide safety program to share best practices and to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations. 

Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers&#8217; compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims. We are required to post letters of credit and provide cash collateral to certain of our insurance carriers and to provide surety bonds in certain states. See Note 15 &#32;- Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 

Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital 

Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required. 

We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors are typically sole proprietorships or small business entities that provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, such as the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers, both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,&#8221; which is incorporated by reference. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. The national or large regional firms that compete with us include Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Pike Electric, Inc., Willbros Group, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Bechtel Corporation, D.H. Blattner &#38; Sons, Inc., M.A. Mortenson Company, General Dynamics, Black &#38; Veatch and Nexius. 

Relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation and customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. Consequently, price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 

As a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including: 

&#8226; 

regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and state equivalents; 

&#8226; 

contractor licensing requirements; 

&#8226; 

permitting and inspection requirements; and 

&#8226; 

building and electrical codes. 

We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. See Item1A. &#8220;Risk Factors - Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.&#8221; 

We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur significant liabilities.

We provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, which we also believe helps us to retain our employees. We believe we have good employee relations.
