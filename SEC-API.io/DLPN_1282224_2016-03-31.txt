 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS. 

Overview 

Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. (&#8220;Dolphin&#8221;) is dedicated to the production of high-quality digital content. Dolphin Digital Studios, a division of ours, is a producer of original, high quality digital programming for online consumption and is committed to delivering premium, best-in-class entertainment and securing premiere distribution partners to maximize audience reach and commercial advertising potential. Dolphin has also partnered with US Youth Soccer Association, Inc, a nonprofit corporation (&#8220;US Youth Soccer&#8221;) and United Way Worldwide, a worldwide philanthropic organization, to develop online kids clubs for several organizations. 

On March 7, 2016, Dolphin, DDM Merger Sub, Inc, our wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;DDM Merger Sub&#8221;), Dolphin Films, Inc. (&#8220;Dolphin Films&#8221;) and Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. (&#8220;Dolphin Entertainment&#8221;) completed our previously announced merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 14, 2015 (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, DDM Merger Sub merged with and into Dophin Films with Dolphin Films surviving the Merger. As a result of the Merger, we acquired Dolphin Films, which is a content producer in the motion picture industry. As consideration for the Merger, we issued 2,300,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 1,000,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to Dolphin Entertainment. Mr O&#8217;Dowd, our President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is the founder, president and sole shareholder of Dolphin Entertainment. The Merger Agreement was approved by our shareholders. 

Premium online video is the largest growth sector for online advertising, with market leaders such as Yahoo!, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and AOL making major initiatives around original programming. 

We target three distinct demographics for our &#8220;web series&#8221; activities: 

&#9679; 

Tweens (roughly 9-14 years old); 

&#9679; 

Teens and Young Adults (roughly 14-24 years old); and 

&#9679; 

General Market (roughly 14-49 years old). 

We expect to serve each of these demographics with different content, and we may have different distribution partners for each demographic. 

Dolphin Digital Studios 

Dolphin Digital Studios is our digital entertainment division which creates original content to premiere online and has been our primary focus during the year ended December 31, 2015. Substantially all of our operating income and expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were related to Dolphin Digital Studios. Dolphin Digital Studios is instrumental in producing, distributing and sourcing financing for our projects. 

Dolphin Films 

Dolphin Films is a content producer of motion pictures. In 2014, we completed our first motion picture, &#8220; Max Steel &#8221; that we expect will be released in late summer of 2016. We also own the rights to several scripts that we intend to produce at a future date. 

Production 

Our in house development team is continuously reviewing scripts for digital projects that are directed at one of our target demographics and that we believe we can produce within our normal planned budget range of $3.0 to $5.0 million. Our budget typically includes costs associated with purchase of the script, production of the project and marketing of the project. Occasionally, we will also hire writers to develop a script for an idea that we have internally. From the selection provided by our development team, our management reviews the scripts and evaluates them based on expected appeal to advertisers, talent we think we can attract, available budget for the production and available financing. We normally purchase a variety of scripts which we hold for future use. Not all scripts purchased will be produced. Some scripts revert back to the writer if they are not produced during a contractually agreed upon timeframe. During 2015, we produced and premiered South Beach-Fever, a 90 minute soap opera set amidst dueling record labels in Miami, on Hulu. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Once we have a stable of scripts, we present a variety of projects, based on these scripts, to online platforms such as Hulu, AOL, and Yahoo!. The online platform will typically evaluate the project based on its estimation of potential demand, considering the genre or demographic to which they are looking to appeal. Once a project is selected by the online platform, we enter into a distribution agreement with the online platform that outlines, among other things, our revenue share percentages (typically between 30% and 45%) and the length of time that the show will air on that online platform. Based on agreements with the online platiforms and advertisers, our management then makes the decision to &#8220;greenlight&#8221; or to approve, a project for production. 

Our aim is to produce young adult and family films and our in-house development team reviews scripts for motion pictures in this genre that can be produced within a budget range of $6.0 to $9.0 million. Our budget includes the cost of acquiring the script and producing the motion picture. We financed our motion picture with funds from investors and the financing of international licensing agreements for the picture. 

The production of digital projects and motion pictures is very similar. Once management greenlights a project, the pre-production phase including the hiring of a director, talent, various crew and securing locations to film begins. We may become signatories to certain guilds such as Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. We typically hire crew members directly, engage a production service company to provide us with, among other things, the crew, equipment and a production office or use a combination of the two alternatives. Directors and talent are typically compensated a base amount for their work. &#160; In addition, directors and talent who are members of various guilds may receive remuneration from &#8220;residuals&#8221; that we pay to the various guilds based on the performance of our productions in ancillary markets. To better manage our upfront production costs, we sometimes structure our agreements with talent to allow them to participate in the proceeds of the digital project or motion picture in exchange for reduced upfront fixed payments, regardless of the project&#8217;s success. 

&#160;

The decision of where to produce the project is oftentimes based on incentive tax programs implemented by many states and foreign countries to attract film production in their jurisdictions as a means of economic development. These incentives normally take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits or cash rebates that are calculated based on a percentage spent in the jurisdiction offering the incentive. The pre-production phase may take several months and is critical to the success of the project. 

The length of time needed to film varies by project but is typically between three and six weeks. Once the filming is completed, the project will enter the post-production phase, which includes film and sound editing, and development of special effects, as needed. Depending on the complexity of the work to be done, post-production may take from two to six months to complete. 

In the last four years, we produced and distributed &#8220; Cybergeddon&#8221; in partnership with Anthony Zuiker, creator of CSI, &#8220;Hiding&#8221; , and &#8220;South Beach- Fever&#8221;, &#160; and were hired to provide production services for &#8220;Aim High&#8221; produced by a related party in conjunction with Warner Brothers. These productions earned various awards including two Streamy Awards. Dolphin Films produced the motion picture, &#8220; Max Steel &#8221; that we expect will be released in 2016. 

During the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a co-production agreement for an upcoming digital series. The series, comprised of six episodes is expected to be produced during the second quarter of 2016 and is anticipated to be released in the third or fourth quarter of 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, we are responsible for 50% of the budget which is approved by us and our production partner. In addition, we are responsible for (a) producing; (b) negotiating and contracting the talent; (c) securing locations; (d) preparing the production and delivery schedules; (e) identifying an securing digital distribution; (f) soliciting and negotiating advertising and sponsorships; (g) legal and business affairs and (h) managing and maintaining the production account. 

Other projects are currently being evaluated and we plan to greenlight at least one additional project to be produced during 2016.

Distribution 

Our digital productions for advertiser supported video-on-demand (&#8220;AVOD&#8221;) platforms have premiered on online platforms such as Hulu. Distribution agreements with online platforms are for a limited period, typically six months. Once the contract expires, we have the ability to distribute our productions in ancillary markets such as through home entertainment, subscription video-on-demand (&#8220;SVOD&#8221;) (e.g. Netflix), pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets. Our ability to distribute these productions in ancillary markets is typically based on the popularity of the project during its initial on-line distribution. 

Similar to distribution of digital productions described above, the economic life of motion pictures is comprised by different phases. The motion picture is initially distributed in theaters. A successful motion picture may remain in theaters for several months and then we have the ability to distribute the motion picture in ancillary markets such as home entertainment, pay-per-view (&#8220;PPV&#8221;), video-on-demand (&#8220;VOD&#8221;), electronic-sell-through (&#8220;EST&#8221;), subscription video-on-demand (&#8220;SVOD&#8221;), advertiser-supported video-on-demand (&#8220;AVOD&#8221;), digital rentals, pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets. Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets. 

Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. We currently have an agreement with a distributor that can place our movies in theaters for a distribution fee. Pursuant to the agreement, the distribution fee varies depending on whether we provide our own Prints and advertising (&#8220;P&#38;A&#8221;) funding or whether the distributor will fund the P&#38;A. We intend to spend between $18 and $25 million to distribute &#8220; Max Steel &#8221; in approximately 2,000 screens nationwide. We have sold the licensing rights to the motion picture in certain international territories and we expect that the movie will be released simultaneously with the domestic release in some of these territories. As part of our domestic distribution arrangement, we will derive revenues from the ancillary markets described above based on the performance of the movie in the domestic box office. 

Financing 

We have financed our acquisition to the rights of certain digital projects and productions through a variety of financing structures including Equity Finance Agreements and Loan and Security Agreements. We earned advertising and producer fee revenues of approximately $2.2 million , net of our commissions, for our &#8220; South Beach - Fever &#8221; web series during 2015. 

We financed our production of &#8220; Max Steel &#8221; using funds from investors and loans partially collateralized by licensing agreements for the exploitation of the motion picture in certain international territories. 

Online Kids Clubs 

Through our online kids clubs we seek to partner with various organizations to provide an online destination for entertainment and information for kids. Through online memberships established &#8220;brands&#8221; in the children&#8217;s space seek to to expand their existing online audience through the promotion of original content supplied and/or sourced by Dolphin Digital Studios. Premium entertainment offerings such as original web series, we expect will serve to both increase audiences through positive word of mouth and to increase engagement, or length of time on site. Furthermore, we expect that the online kids clubs will serve as a platform for sponsorship and other marketing opportunities, such as contests and sweepstakes and as strong marketing vehicles for the respective brands, as they keep the brands &#8220;top of mind&#8221; for the youngest generation, and in a space (the online world) where they increasingly go. 

We believe that online kids clubs will provide us the opportunity to capitalize on the combination of the following two consumer trends: 

&#9679; 

a greater number of children under the age of 18 have access to the internet (and most &#8220;own&#8221; their own devices &#8211; e.g. laptop computers, tablets and smartphones) 

&#9679; 

those children who have access to the internet spend an increasing amount of time online. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Simply put, the internet has become the next generation&#8217;s &#8220;go to&#8221; destination for both entertainment and information. 

Brands that are &#8220;offline&#8221; (those without a marketing presence over the internet) need to engage with their participants &#8220;online&#8221; (or marketed over the internet) or risk losing them altogether. To build successful engagement with children and teenagers in the &#8220;real world&#8221; and offer them nothing (let alone an equivalent engagement opportunity) in the digital world is a tremendous lost opportunity. For example, Little Leagues may exist for the enjoyment of children, but their websites are overwhelmingly only used by parents. Similarly, non-profits may exist to provide enrichment and cultural opportunities for children, but their websites are seldom visited by the children they serve. 

In 2013, we entered into an agreement with United Way Worldwide to create an online kids club which promotes the organization&#8217;s philanthropic philosophy and encourages literacy in elementary school age children. According to various studies, high school drop-out rates have a direct, proportional correlation to 3rd grade reading proficiency. If a child is already behind in their reading proficiency after 3rd grade, they are over 4x more likely to drop out of high school (a rate which increases to 10x for minority children). In the U.S., nearly 60% of fourth graders are not reading at their grade level. Our online kids club offers reading activities, articles and games. It also promotes parent engagement by emailing parents and continuously messaging the importance of reading and parent involvement to achieve reading proficiency. We have also partnered with Scholastic Books to provide to schools sponsored by a donor, a location in the school that is transformed into a reading room (the &#8220;Reading Oasis &#8221; ). 

Donors may sponsor a school for $10,000 which entitles each child in the school to receive an annual online kids club membership and entitles the school to receive a Reading Oasis. The Reading Oasis provides the school with hundreds of books (K-3), colorful bean bag chairs, a reading themed carpet, book cases, a listening library, and a stereo listening center with four headphones. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will share revenues derived from memberships to the online kids club with United Way Worldwide. 

&#160;

In 2012, we entered into an agreement with US Youth Soccer to create, design and host the US Youth Soccer Clubhouse website aimed at attracting members such as individuals, US Youth Soccer State Associations and members of such State Associations. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will share revenues derived from such memberships with US Youth Soccer. 

&#160;

We operate our kids club activities through our subsidiary, Dolphin Kids Club LLC (&#8220;Dolphin Kids Club&#8221;). We own 75% of Dolphin Kids Club and the other 25% is owned by a former note holder. The agreement encompasses kids clubs created between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. It is a &#8220;gross revenue agreement&#8221; and we are responsible for paying all associated operating expenses. Net income will be attributable to each member based on the thresholds established in the operating agreement of the entity. 

Project Development and Related Services 

During 2013, we entered into an agreement with &#160; Dolphin Films, Inc., an entity, at the time indirectly owned by our CEO, in which we agreed to provide management team and back office services through December 31, 2014. The agreement was for the term April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 for an annual fee of $2.0 million. Pursuant to the agreement, we provided the related party with a development team to source new projects, production executives to develop scripts, approve budgets and hire and liaise with the production team on individual projects during the production and post-production phases, an accounting and finance team to provide accounting services and tax compliance, in addition to legal support and domestic and international sales support. We also provided office space in Los Angeles and Miami. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded revenues in the amount of $2.0 million, related to this agreement. The agreement ended on December 31, 2014 and was not renewed for 2015, as the specific projects for which our services were engaged were completed. As discussed earlier, on March 7, 2016, as a result of the Merger, we acquired Dolphin Films. 

Intellectual Property 

We seek to protect our intellectual property through trademarks and copyright . We currently hold three trademarks for Cybergeddon and two copyrights for each of Cybergeddon and Hiding . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

The business in which we engage is highly competitive. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. Our primary business operations are subject to competition from other digital media and movie production companies as well as from large, well established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars. 

Given this highly competitive business, our business model is focused on providing high-quality entertainment at a lower production budget. We intend to achieve this by relying on innovative financial structures, partnering with well established brands for production content and lowering overhead cost structure. 

Customers 

During 2014, we depended on a single customer for the majority of our revenues. On April 1, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Dolphin Films , pursuant to which we provided management team and back office services to Dolphin Films . For the years ended December 31, 2014, we recorded service revenues in the amount of $2.0 million related to this agreement. This amount represented 97% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014. The agreement expired on December 31, 2014 and was not renewed for 2015 as the specific projects for which our services were engaged were completed. On March 7, 2016, as a result of the Merger, we acquired Dolphin Films. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we have 20 full-time employees in our operations and believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional employees on a project-by-project basis in connection with the production of digital projects and motion pictures. 

Regulatory Matters 

Our online kids clubs programs which are aimed at elementary school age children are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection. Through our online kids clubs we may monitor and collect certain information about the child users of these forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (&#8220;COPPA&#8221;). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual's personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). 

We are also subject to state and federal work and safety laws and disclosure obligations, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state organizations.
