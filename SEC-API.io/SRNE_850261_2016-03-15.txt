Business. 

Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, acquisition, development and commercialization of proprietary drug therapeutics for addressing significant unmet medical needs worldwide. Our primary therapeutic focus is oncology, including the treatment of chronic cancer pain, but we are also developing therapeutic products for other indications, including immunology and infectious diseases. We currently have multiple clinical development programs underway: (i) CAR-T programs for solid tumors, (ii) resiniferatoxin, or RTX, a non-opiate, ultra-potent and selective agonist of the TRPV-1 receptor for intractable pain in end-stage disease, and (iii) biosimilar/biobetter antibodies clinical development programs. 

Our pipeline also includes preclinical fully human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including biosimilars/biobetters, fully human anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors derived from our proprietary G-MAB &#174; library platform, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), as well as Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell (CAR-T) and Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer (NK) cells (CAR. NK&#8482;) for adoptive cellular immunotherapy. Our objective is to develop our antibody drug products and adoptive cellular immunotherapies as: (i) First in Class (FIC), and/or (ii) Best in Class (BIC), which may offer greater efficacy and/or fewer adverse events or side effects as compared to existing drugs, as well as fully human therapeutic antibodies derived from our proprietary G-MAB&#8482; antibody library platform and ADCs.

&#160;

SORRENTO PIPELINE: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Although we intend to retain ownership and control of product candidates by advancing their development, we regularly also consider partnerships with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies in order to balance the risks and costs associated with drug discovery and development and maximize our stockholders&#8217; returns. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties by licensing rights to our product candidates. Moreover, we are looking at strategic collaborations whereby the partner will be responsible for certain product and clinical development costs in exchange for marketing and distribution rights in the US, ex-US or globally. Through various joint ventures, we will also be able to advance our pipeline into the clinic without significantly draining our resources and focus since these entities will be operating and funded independently.

Recent Developments

In March 2015, we entered into a binding term sheet with NantCell, LLC (&#8220;NantCell&#8221;) and then, into a license agreement in April 2015, pursuant to which we licensed to NantCell a number of immune-checkpoint antibodies, immune-oncology antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and certain other antibodies from our G-MAB library, as well as a couple of CAR-TNK products. Following the closing of a NantCell&#8217;s equity financing, we were issued $100 million in vested NantCell equity. 

In May 2015, we entered into a stock sale and purchase agreement with NantPharma, LLC (&#8220;NantPharma&#8221;) pursuant to which we sold to NantPharma all of our equity interests in IgdraSol, Inc. (&#8220;IgDraSol&#8221;), which was our wholly-owned subsidiary and the holder of the rights to Cynviloq, a polymeric micelle based Cremophor-free paclitaxel injectable finished formulation. Pursuant to the agreement, NantPharma paid us an upfront payment of $90.05 million. In addition, the we are entitled to receive up to $620 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $600 million in sales milestone payments. We will also receive specified additional per unit payments in excess of cost of supply from total unit sales. In addition, during the first three years after closing, we have the option to co-develop and/or co-market Cynviloq on terms to be negotiated. Previously, on May 4, 2015, we announced what we believed to be positive results from recently analyzed pharmacokinetic (PK) data from its TRIBECA&#8482; (TRIal establishing BioEquivalence between Cynviloq&#8482; and Albumin-bound paclitaxel) registrational trial.

In May 2015, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, TNK Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;TNK&#8221;). This subsidiary will focus on developing CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells) as well as other complementary cellular and immunotherapies utilizing modified or unmodified donor-derived immune cells to target both solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

In June 2015, we entered into a limited liability agreement and contribution agreement (&#8220;JV Agreements&#8221;) with NantCell, to form a joint venture, Immunotherapy Nantibody, LLC (the &#8220;JV&#8221;). Pursuant to the JV Agreements, NantCell agreed to contribute $60 million to the JV, and we agreed to contribute $40 million. For these contributions, NantCell owns 60% of the equity interest of and we own 40% of NANTibody. In July 2015, we had NantPharma contribute our portion of the initial joint funding of $40 million to 

&#160;

NANTibody from the proceeds of the sale of IgDraSol. In addition, we agreed to contribute to the JV seventy-five (75) immuno-oncology antibodies, immune-check point antibodies, bi-specific antibodies and/or antibody drug conjugates. NantCell also contributed a late stage monoclonal antibody. For our contribution, we will be owed a royalty of 5% for each of our contributed antibodies described abov e. 

In July 2015, we entered into a limited liability company agreement with NantBioScience, Inc. (&#8220;NantBioScience&#8221;) to form NantCancerStemCell, LLC (&#8220;NantCancerStemCell&#8221;). Pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to contribute a number of our licensed small molecule compounds such as anti-myc compounds, and potentially licensable small molecule compounds such as compounds against the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and make capital contributions to NantCancerStemCell equal to $40 million in the aggregate (and NantBioScience agreed to make capital contributions to NantCancerStemCell equal to $60 million in the aggregate). We had NantPharma contribute our portion of the initial joint funding of $20 million to NantCancerStemCell from the proceeds from the sale of IgDraSol. Pursuant to a letter agreement executed on October 14, 2015 (the &#8220;October Letter&#8221;), NantBioScience and we agreed that the we would be relieved of our obligation to make the final $20 million capital contribution to NantCancerStemCell and our percentage interest in NantCancerStemCell was reduced to 20% and NantBioScience&#8217;s percentage interest in NantCancerStemCell was increased to 80%.

In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize four, late-stage clinical biosimilar or biobetter antibodies based on Erbitux&#174;, Remicade&#174;, Xolair&#174;, and Simulect&#174; for the North American, European and Japanese markets from Mabtech Limited, a holding company for antibody development and manufacturing companies in China. Each of these four antibody programs has already completed Phase 3 clinical studies in China. Pursuant to the agreement, we made an initial license payment of $10.0 million which was recognized. The agreement includes additional milestone payments totaling up to $190.0 million payable over the next five years. Subsequently, in October 2015, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sorrento Biologics, Inc. (&#8220;Sorrento Biologics&#8221;) with the intent to hold the rights to the above biosmilar or biobetter antibodies.

In August 2015, TNK and we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Membership Interest Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with CARgenix Holdings LLC (&#8220;CARgenix&#8221;) and the members of CARgenix (the &#8220;Members&#8221;) pursuant to which the Members sold all of their membership interests in CARgenix to TNK for: (1) a cash payment of $100.00, and (2) $6.0 million in shares of TNK Class A common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, to be issued to the Members upon a financing resulting in gross proceeds (individually or in the aggregate) to TNK of at least $50.0 million (a &#8220;Qualified Financing&#8221;).

Pending our due diligence, we plan on entering into one or more definitive agreements with CTC and FTC incorporating the terms set forth in the binding term sheet.

&#160;

In September 2015, LA Cell, Inc. (&#8220;LA Cell&#8221;), one of our subsidiaries, entered into an exclusive license agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with City of Hope, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation (&#8220;City of Hope&#8221;), pursuant to which LA Cell licensed technology developed at City of Hope that enables modified monoclonal antibodies (&#8220;mAbs&#8221;) to penetrate into cells and target &#8216;undruggable&#8221; disease-causi ng molecules. The total deal value is in excess of $170 million for the development of these modified mAbs and includes an equity provision as well as upfront and milestone payments to City of Hope. In addition, LA Cell will pay a royalty on net sales to City of Hope during the term of the Agreement. The Agreement was amended and restated on December 11, 2015, to expand the license to include all indications. 

In October 2015, we entered into an option agreement with Cambridge Equities, LP (&#8220;Cambridge&#8221;) pursuant to which the we granted to Cambridge an unconditional, irrevocable option (the &#8220;Option&#8221;) to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of NantKwest, Inc.

Our Strategy

Our mission is to improve the lives of patients and assist their care providers by delivering novel therapies that improve outcomes while reducing the undesirable side effects of many current therapies. We believe we have assembled a strong team with in-depth domain knowledge in targeted therapeutics development. We are fostering an integrated, multidisciplinary model for drug discovery, clinical development and manufacturing. Our strategy is to discover, acquire, develop, and commercialize proprietary drugs for significant unmet medical needs, with a focus on cancer therapeutics. The key elements to our long-term oncology business strategy are described below: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Resiniferatoxin, or RTX, may permanently eliminate intractable cancer pain and may be applicable to other therapeutic indications in both humans and animals. RTX is a novel, small molecule with a non-opiate mechanism of action that may eliminate targeted intractable cancer pain experienced by end-stage cancer patients. When injected intraspinally or paraspinally, RTX directly interacts with nerve cells expressing TRPV-1 receptors without affecting normal sensation (touch and vibration sense) or muscle function. RTX has been tested in animals and was tested in an investigator-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial at the National Institute of Health, or NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. To date, 12 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated at NIH. We intend to launch additional trials to rapidly advance clinical development of the drug in patients with intractable cancer pain under our own IND. 

&#160;

&#183; 

G-MAB &#174; , our proprietary platform, provides us with specific therapeutic antibodies for specific cancer cell targeting and killing. Our proprietary G-MAB human antibody library has provided us with fully human therapeutic mAbs against many cancer targets. The individual mAbs discovered from our G-MAB library potentially give us a multitude of therapeutic options to target and attack cancer cells. This could be either directly, such as: (i) recruitment of immune effector functions, including, but not limited to, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, or (ii) antagonistic suppression of cellular signaling processes required for cancer proliferation and metastasis; or indirectly, via modulation of host biology, such as: (a) enhancement of immune activity in the tumor, or (b) normalization of the tumor microenvironment, including anti-angiogenesis for cutting off blood supplies to the tumor. Our lead antibody programs include anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunomodulatory antibodies. Based on clinical data from competitor programs, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab (Opdivo&#174;; BMS) and pembrolizumab &#174; (Keytruda&#174;; Merck) and anti-PD-L1 mAbs atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; Genentech) and durvalumab (MEDI4736; AstraZeneca), and Avelumab (EMD Serono/Pfizer), such immunomodulatory antibodies have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy across a number of different oncology indications 

&#160;

&#183; 

Antibody drug conjugates (ADC) and Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) for targeted tumor killing . By leveraging the extensive G-MAB Library with our proprietary conjugation and bispecific antibody chemistries, we are positioned to generate proprietary ADCs and BsAbs with significant clinical activity. As both of our technologies are solely based on chemical modifications of the antibody rather than relying on genetic modifications, fusion proteins, or incorporation of unnatural amino acids, they can be utilized with &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; antibodies. This will further empower our G-MAB-derived antibodies and potentially lower development costs. Our lead BsAb programs currently focus on combinations of our anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies paired with another immunomodulatory antibody component or an anti-tumor antigen antibody. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy with CAR-T cells and CAR . NKs : The adoptive immunotherapy field has emerged as the one of most promising and innovative anti-cancer strategies. To date, T-cell based therapies like CAR-T have shown the most promise in hematologic cancers, especially B-cell malignancies like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). They have also demonstrated outstanding therapeutic impact, including a high percentage of complete responses (CRs) in Hodgkin lymphoma patients using CD19-CAR T cells. While the clinical results have been promising, CAR-T therapies have also caused some concerning side effects, especially cytokine-release 

&#160;

&#160;

syndrome due to the injection of cytokine-releasing T cells. Currently, patient-derived T cells are isolated, propagated, and modified with the CAR in the laboratory and then administered back into the patient. The process, however, solely relies on the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of patient immune cells and to successfully bestow upon them the ability to express the CAR. 

The CAR. NK approach will utilize either an-immortalized NK cell line, such as the one from NantKwest called NK-92 as the source for the immune cells or primary or placental NK cells. These NK cells will be genetically modified to express surface receptors using our G-MAB library that would allow these cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Biosimilars/Biobetters . Major branded biologic products with a total of approximately $100 billion of global sales have either lost patent exclusivity or will do so through 2020. The US created the 351(k) biosimilar pathway in 2010 with the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) which was passed in the Affordable Care Act. EMA established a similar framework in 2005, and many markets around the world have adopted similar guidelines. Biosimilars must precisely match the amino acid sequence of the originator&#8217;s molecule. Unlike the amino acid sequence, glyclosylation of the biosimilar mAbs may vary and are dependent on the cell line and growth conditions. Parts of the glycosylation pattern are critical for biological function and the pattern affects the PK/PD and safety/efficacy profile. Biosimilar development and commercialization requires significant commercial and complex analytical and development capabilities. By leveraging existing biosimilars/biobetters from regional markets, we potentially are able to expedite their entrance into the world drug market. The in-licensed biosimilar and biobetter antibodies include: cetuximab targeting the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR); infliximab targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;); omalizumab targeting IgE; and basiliximab targeting the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R&#945; or CD25). Together, these 4 mAbs target an established market with combined annual global sales in 2014 in excess of $13 billion. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cell-Internalizing Technology . LA Cell, our joint venture with the City of Hope, has an exclusive license to technology developed at City of Hope to enable modified monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to penetrate into cells and target previously &#8220;undruggable&#8221; disease-causing proteins. The technology is based on a proprietary chemical modification of mAbs that allows the modified mAb penetrating into the cell while maintaining their ability to binding to specific target proteins. This novel cell-internalizing technology could be transformative for the field of biomedical research and biopharmaceutical development. In particular, we aim to combine LA Cell&#8217;s cell-penetrating technology with our fully human antibody library and immunotherapy expertise to enable the development of effective antibody therapies against elusive intracellular targets. 

In the near term, we expect to focus our resources on: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advancing RTX into pivotal phase II clinical human development under Sorrento-sponsored IND; and filing a NADA under an already approved MUMS designation for veterinary indications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advancing STI-001 into late phase human clinical trials in the US and/or EU via biosimilar regulatory pathways; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Establishing critical biological product development capabilities such as modern cGMP manufacturing facility and operation, process development, analytical development and quality systems; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Prioritizing our preclinical pipeline, and advancing selected drug development candidates into clinical trials ourselves or through strategic collaborations with biotech and/or pharmaceutical companies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

advancing CAR-T and CAR.NK programs into clinical trials under our sponsored IND; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continuing to explore potential accretive and/or synergistic products and/or platforms that will enhance our pipeline and technologies 

See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the risks relating to the execution of our business strategy. 

&#160;

Prod uct Candidates 

We previously had one late-stage oncology drug candidate, Cynviloq, for which we completed a BE registrational trial for multiple solid tumor indications and an ongoing phase I/II study of RTX for intractable cancer pain, but we transferred our rights to it as part of the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary, IgDraSol, to NantPharma. Additionally, we have multiple mAb product candidates in preclinical development including our fully human anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 mAbs and several ADCs against validated cancer targets. We believe these individual mAb or ADC product candidates have the potential to address major unmet medical needs. 

&#160;

&#160;

RTX 

According to the American Cancer Society, about 1.5 million people are diagnosed annually with cancer. Each year in the U.S., almost 600,000 people die from cancer, of which approximately 80 percent of those patients experience moderate to severe pain lasting over 90 days. The cost of keeping these patients comfortable adds significantly to the overall cost of treatment. Patient&#8217;s primary options are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opiates that have a wide variety of administration routes. NSAID s have marginal efficacy, and while opioids can be efficacious, the doses required to achieve efficacy often are accompanied by considerable side effects that severely impact patients&#8217; quality of life such that patients require significant supportive care. In 2005, over 345 million doses of morphine were sold in the U.S. for breakthrough pain alone. High dose opiates are given as a baseline treatment and then patients with breakthrough pain receive additional medication. The cost for treating breakthrough cancer pain using rapidly acting fentanyl preparations (e.g. Actiq &#174; or Fentora &#174; ) can reach over $5,000 per patient over a 90 day period. Implantable intrathecal morphine pumps (for 24-hour morphine delivery) can cost over $60,000 to implant, excluding the cost of the medicine and related maintenance. Furthermore, opiates are highly addictive and when misused can result in death from respiratory depression. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation programs are regulatory requirements put in place in an effort to assure safe use of these DEA-scheduled compounds, and are costly not only to the manufacturers but also to the healthcare system. Patients develop tolerance to opioids, requiring higher doses to treat the same amount of pain, which can lead to greater or more frequent side effects and the potential for addiction. 

RTX is a small molecule with a non-opiate mechanism of action that may permanently eliminate intractable cancer pain experienced by end-stage cancer patients. When injected intraspinally or paraspinally, RTX directly interacts with nerve cells expressing TRPV-1 receptors without affecting normal sensation (touch and vibration sense) or muscle function. RTX has been extensively tested in animals and was tested in an investigator-sponsored Phase I/II clinical trial at the National Institute of Health or NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement To date, 12 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated at NIH. The NIH is exploring the possibility of enrolling more patients, but must first respond to a clinical hold placed on all programs at the NIH where the investigational drug, not an RTX specific hold, was prepared by the NIH pharmacy. We intend to launch additional trials this year to advance clinical development of the drug in patients with intractable cancer pain.

&#160;

The mechanism of action for RTX is well understood and has been validated by extensive data in both animals and humans. In chronic pain states, TRPV-1 is upregulated and expressed to a greater degree resulting in central hypersensitivity and pathological pain states. When the drug is delivered via intrathecal inj ection, through a catheter placed in the cerebrospinal fluid space, it targets and binds to TRPV-1 receptors expressed by specific neurons in the dorsal root ganglion and superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal column. RTX binding to TRPV-1 res ults in calcium influx, which initiates programmed cell death (&#8220;apoptosis&#8221;) of only the targeted neurons and, therefore, results in the permanent reduction of pain transmitted by these TRPV-1 positive neurons. The drug is highly specific and does not bind to the large myelinated nerves that transmit normal pain sensations (touch and vibration or position sense), control muscle function or impact cognition. The RTX injection is performed by an anesthesia pain specialist, neurologist, spine surgeon or interve ntional radiologist trained in such procedures under fluoroscopic guidance as an outpatient procedure under general anesthesia. RTX has the potential of reducing pain without the side effects associated with opiates, including impairment of physical and/or mental facilities. Treatment is expected to address significant unmet medical needs by producing long lasting, analgesic coverage of intractable chronic pain syndromes. Other potential indications include intractable phantom limb pain, pain related to spi nal cord injury, and focal neuropathies such as trigeminal neuralgia. 

We are testing targeted injections into or near specific ganglia (e.g., dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia or sympathetic ganglia). This approach can place RTX in a precise location and avoids the diffuse spread that is possible with RTX injected intrathecally. We are evaluating other severe pain indications that may be approached by local administration of our existing formulations. We believe that these applications of RTX have high unmet needs that can be addressed with relatively low-cost and short-duration development plans. 

We have opened an INAD for osteosarcoma-associated pain in dogs with the Center for Veterinary Medicine (&#8220;CVM&#8221;) division of the FDA. We received on June 19, 2015 the designation for our lead RTX product, ARK-001, under the minor use/minor species (MUMS) act, legislation which is similar to an Orphan Product Designation for human medicines. Under a MUMS designation, drugs with a reasonable expectation of efficacy in a minor use, such as osteosarcomas, may be marketed in parallel with the pivotal efficacy trial. We are preparing the NADA to allow marketing ofof the product, while in parallel, will have four yearso complete the pivotal registration trial required by CVM for full approval. We are also testing other veterinary indications whose pathology is driven by afferent nerves and delivery of RTX may be beneficial. The veterinary market for RTX presents additional low risk opportunities to generate value for our enterprise and to support the human development programs a low cost. We have formed a wholly owned subsidiary, ARK Animal Health, Inc. (&#8220;Ark&#8221;&#8221;), and are accumulating other products to add to ARK&#8217;s pipeline. 

G-MAB &#174; Fully Human Antibody Library Platform 

We believe our proprietary G-MAB library is one of the industry&#8217;s most diverse fully human antibody libraries. Our library achieves its vast diversity from a large collection of high-quality antibodies. The theoretical diversity of our library has been calculated to be more than one quadrillion unique antibodies, making it, to our knowledge, one of the largest fully human antibody libraries available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug discovery and development partnerships. Our objective is to leverage our library to develop both FIC and/or BIC antibody drug candidates that we expect will possess greater efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to existing drugs. In addition, the success we have achieved finding strong fully human antibodies that bind to a diverse array of targets provides an ample menu of antibodies for conjugating various small molecule drugs with our antibodies used as the targeting moieties of ADCs or components of BsAbs. 

We have experienced a high success rate when screening our diverse library to identify monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, that have the potential to be used as drugs. Recently, we have selected several lead drug development candidates to advance into clinical trials in 2016, including anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, and anti-VEGFR2 mAbs. 

&#160;

The following is a chart of fully human mAbs we have derived from our G-MAB library. It includes antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets, from small molecular weight antigens to large protein complexes antigens, s uch as G-Protein Coupled Receptors, or GPCRs, a difficult class of antigens to raise therapeutic antibodies against. 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to employing our G-MAB library to identify novel therapeutic antibodies, we also plan to: (i) develop potent antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, for the treatment of certain auto-immune diseases as well as immunodeficiencies. 

G-MAB &#174; Fully Human Product Candidates 

We have multiple wholly-owned product candidates in preclinical development and a discovery effort advancing additional therapeutic mAb drug candidates, all derived from our G-MAB library. We believe these product candidates, individually or as components of ADCs, have the potential to address major unmet medical needs. 

Fully human anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies 

Overview 

In recent early clinical studies performed by competitor pharmaceutical companies, immune-oncology anti-cancer antibody therapeutics, including mAbs against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), have demonstrated great promise for the treatment of tumors. PD-1 is a T-cell surface protein while PD-L1 is a tumor-associated surface protein. By blocking immunosuppressive signals originating on cancer cells directed against infiltrating T cells, the patients&#8217; own anti-tumor immune response may be rejuvenated. 

Preclinical Anti-PD-1 and Anti-PD-L1 Data and Development Plan 

Each of our mAbs is novel, proprietary, and fully human. Our most advanced preclinical mAb related to our anti-PD-1 antibody is STI-A1110, and our most advanced preclinical mAbs related to anti-PD-L1 antibodies are STI-A1014 (lead candidate), and STI-A1015. In preclinical studies, our mAbs were at least as potent and effective as the anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs from competitor companies. We have concluded cell line development for our anti-PD-L1 antibody, STI-A1014. We anticipate that a Phase I clinical trial for the lead candidate anti-PD-L1 antibody could be initiated in 2016. In 2014, we entered into a licensing agreement with Lee&#8217;s Pharma granting them exclusive rights to STI-A1014 for the greater Chinese market, where STI-A1014 is progressing in IND-enabling studies. Lee&#8217;s Pharma will be responsible for most of the pre-clinical and CMC work, including the development of master cell bank for STI-A1014 and cGMP antibody manufacturing in preparation for regulatory filing in China. 

We anticipate that our anti-PD-1 mAb STI-A1110, the anti-VEGFR2 mAb STI-A0168, and anti-PD-L1 mAb STI-A1015 will enter into IND-enabling studies in 2016 or 2017. We are currently seeking strategic collaborations to advance these programs as quickly as possible into the clinic.

While our checkpoint inhibitors maybe late into the market as compared to other big pharma players like BMS, Roche, Merck and Merck Serrono, we believe that the future with the immunomodulatory antibodies lie with combination therapy. We note that several large clinical trials are currently recruiting combining antibodies with taxanes and other chemotherapy/small molecules such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors in various solid tumor types. We believe we are well positioned to exploit our internal pipeline comprising of various immunomodulatory antibodies to become a leader in the oncology space.

&#160;

Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) Technologies 

Our ADCs, have cytotoxic payloads as well as C-Lock &#8482; and K-Lock &#8482; conjugation technologies that allow for site-specific toxin conjugation to the antibody. The ADC technology complements our existing development programs, particularly our G-MAB-derived monoclonal antibodies. 

Our two most advanced ADC projects utilize G-MAB-derived c-MET and c-MET/EGFR antibodies. 

Our mAb Technology Advantages 

The G-MAB Library was initially invented by Henry Ji, Ph.D., our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President. A U.S. patent covering the initial incarnation of the G-MAB Library was issued in July 2008 and additional patent application families for the generation, display and screening of antibody libraries are pending. We also recently filed a group of patent applications covering improvements to the initial G-MAB Library, with the key improvements relating to what we believe is our ability to achieve greater library diversity. 

We believe the G-MAB Library may offer the following advantages over competing antibody libraries: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The G-MAB Library has been designed to provide a full spectrum of human immunoglobulin gene recombination in fully-human mAb libraries. Unlike chimeric and humanization technologies, the G-MAB Library has allowed the generation of antibodies with fully-human protein sequences without the challenges and limitations of animal-to-human gene transfer procedures; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Because the G-MAB Library represents an in vitro human mAb library technology, it enables faster and cost-effective in vitro screening of a large number of antigens. The G-MAB Library is designed so that any antigen of interest can be investigated, without dependence on the successful induction of a host immune response against the antigen. As compared to a human-mouse technology, the G-MAB Library does not require the costly establishment and maintenance of large animal facilities. In addition, a given human antigen may not induce an immune response in mice. 

Our Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy Approach

The adoptive immunotherapy field has emerged as one of the most promising and innovative anti-cancer strategies. To date, T-cell based therapies like CAR-T have shown the most promise in hematologic cancers, especially B-cell malignancies like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). They have also demonstrated outstanding therapeutic impact, including a high percentage of complete responses (CRs) in Hodgkin lymphoma patients using CD19-CAR T cells. While the clinical results seen have been promising, CAR-T therapies have also caused some concerning side effects, especially cytokine-release syndrome due to the injection of cytokine-releasing T cells. Currently, patient-derived T cells are isolated, propagated, and modified with the CAR in the laboratory and then administered back into the patient. The process, however, solely relies on the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of patient immune cells and to successfully bestow upon them the ability to express the CAR.

The CAR.NK approach will utilize either an immortalized NK cell line from our partner, NantKwest called NK-92 as the source for the immune cells or primary or placental NK cells. These NK cells will be genetically modified to express surface receptors using our G-MAB library that would allow these cells to recognize antigens on tumor cells. 

LA Cell Cell-Penetrating Antibody Technology

Our Subsidiary company, LA Cell, Inc., is a joint venture between us and City of Hope. LA Cell has exclusively licensed a technology that enables cell penetration of antibodies to target virtually any intracellular molecule, including those deemed thus far to be &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. Data show that the cell-penetrating antibodies are capable of specifically inhibiting crucial cancer causing molecules, such as a KRAS mutant, in tumor models in vitro and in vivo.

Antibody therapeutics, compared to other drug modalities, have the advantage of specificity, ease of creation, and long-lasting effects in vivo . Although antibody-based therapies have benefited millions of patients, they can only reach proteins on the cell surface and in circulation. However, most disease-causing molecules are located within the cells. This exclusively licensed technology developed by City of Hope scientists allows antibodies to reach proteins inside cells, bind to the intended target molecules, leading to target inhibition and tumor shrinkage.

A Groundbreaking Technology for Antibody-based Therapeutics

The cell-penetrating antibody technology involves a specific chemical modification of antibodies. Attachment of the chemical moiety to antibodies can be achieved by a very controlled way with high yield and excellent purity. This novel technology to enable 

&#160;

antibody cell penetration has the possibility to revolutionize medicine: effectively treating incurable dis eases, including most difficult cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, or infectious diseases, including chronic viral infections like HIV or HBV. To date, this technology has been tested with multiple targets and in a variety of tumor models by a number of s cientists, including those from City of Hope. 

Far Reaching Implications of the Technology

This technology may also allow for efficient delivery of antibody-siRNA and ADCs. Antibodies guide the drug or siRNA to the target cells, such as cancer cells or infected cells, as well as facilitate efficient intracellular delivery of the payloads. In addition to antibodies, other large protein molecules, such as enzymes, can also benefit from this delivery technology, for example, in enzyme replacement therapies for certain genetic disorders. Peptides, although much smaller than antibodies and most enzymes, can also be modified with this technology and so converted into more effective drugs with efficient cell uptake. 

Advancing to Clinical Studies

Human antibodies or humanized antibodies are most often used in clinical studies. Until the advent of this technology, there was no way to develop and deliver human antibodies against intracellular targets. As a member of the LA Cell joint venture, we have generated fully human antibodies against a number of key oncology targets, including myc oncoprotein, STAT3 and FoxP3. LA Cell scientists are working closely with our researchers to generate more antibodies against intercellular targets with high unmet medical need. 

Once the human antibodies are available, in-depth in vitro and in vivo studies will be performed to evaluate the antibodies against the target and in halting or reversing disease progression. With close collaborations between our scientists, City of Hope and LA Cell, we envision possible clinical testing of several antibody drugs for oncology as well as a rich pipeline of cell-penetrating mAb-based immunotherapies for the foreseeable future. LA Cell is also actively looking for partners from the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industry to advance the discovery and development of game-changing cell-penetrating mAbs. 

Biosimilar/Biobetter mAbs, immune checkpoint mAbs, CAR-T, CAR. NK, ADC and RTX Competition 

We compete in an industry characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in both the discovery and development of any of our biosimilar/biobetter mAbs, G-MAB library derived mAbs, CAR-Ts and CAR.NKs, ADC and RTX product opportunities. New discoveries and developments occur and are expected to continue to occur at a rapid pace. There are many companies, including major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies, engaged in activities similar to ours. Universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research and may market commercial products on their own or through joint ventures. 

Many of these entities are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, technical staff, manufacturing, research and development resources, including personnel and technology, expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights and marketing capabilities than us, and many have significant experience in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution and other regulatory approval and commercial procedures. They may also have a greater number of patents and greater legal resources to seek remedies for cases of alleged infringement of their patents, which may have the effect of blocking, delaying or compromising our own drug development process. 

A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us; in some instances, these products have already entered clinical trials or are already being marketed. Discoveries or commercial developments by our competitors may render some or all of our technologies or potential products obsolete or non-competitive. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as a trade secret or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents or other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. 

We have multiple issued patents and patent applications pending, in the US and in select jurisdictions outside of the US, covering our G-MAB TM technology, G-MAB-derived antibodies, RTX and our other proprietary technology, assets and product candidates, including, but not limited to, the following:

&#160;

1) 

For our G-MAB TM technology, we have issued patents and pending patent application in the US and Europe with potential coverage until at least 2023. 

&#160;

&#160;

2) 

For our antibody por tfolio, we have issued patents and pending patent applications with potential coverage to 2033 and beyond. 

&#160;

3) 

Bispecific antibody technology allows us to engineer therapeutics with two different monoclonal antibodies or fragments with two different antigen targets. These specially designed antibodies potentially provide better cancer immunotherapeutics that combat some of the issues with traditional immunotherapy, for instance immunogenicity and side-effects. We have filed patent applications related to bispecific antibody development technology with potential patent coverage up to 2035. 

&#160;

4) 

The RTX product is protected by a family of patents, that provides potential product patent protection until 2021and pending patent applications that can provide potential patent protection to at least 2036. 

&#160;

5) 

There are multiple families of ADC patent applications that describe and claim the conjugation chemistries that we call C-Lock and K-Lock, two initially developed by Concortis, our wholly-owned subsidiary. These patent applications have a term of potential patent protection until 2034. Concortis has also developed different toxin derivatives, coupled to the Concortis proprietary conjugation chemistry, for proprietary ADCs. The patent applications supporting this effort, if they issue into patents, would expire in 2035.

&#160;

6) 

Our CART-Cell based technology is an immunotherapy platform with multiple separate patent families. These patent applications can have potential patent terms up to 2035. 

&#160;

7) 

CAR adoptive cellular immunotherapy using both T cells and NK immune cells use one&#8217;s own immune system in fighting the diseases, including cancer. We have filed patent applications on the novel techniques for creating such therapies based on our CAR combination therapies. These applications can have potential patent terms up to 2036. 

&#160;

8) 

LA Cell, our joint venture with City of Hope, has exclusively licensed potentially, groundbreaking cell-internalizing technology from City of Hope, including patent application families having a potential term of coverage up to 2036. 

&#160;

9) 

We have four biosimilar/biobetter patent families with potential patent terms up to 2035. 

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 

While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot give assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate. 

In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160;

U.S. Government Regulations 

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our products in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) or an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the NDA for review; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S. 

In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and the use and handling of hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste. 

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site&#8217;s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 

The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug&#8217;s pharmacokinetics and 

&#160;

&#160;

pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid P hase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 

A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate&#8217;s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase III studies but may be Phase II studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 

The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 

Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 

After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and 

&#160;

production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy informatio n, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regula ted, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon u s and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory complian ce. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA&#8217;s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Available Special Regulatory Procedures 

Formal Meetings 

We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the U.S., there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 

The EMA also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting. 

&#160;

Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmaco-vigilance p lans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from health authorities in the U.S. and the European Union, SPA or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA&#8217;s agreement to an SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studi es begin, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. 

In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 

In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Authorization Procedures in the European Union 

Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Centralized procedure . The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160;

&#183; 

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Mutual recogniti on procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other Euro pean Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (European Union) 

Based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 

Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g. heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops. 

There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Healthcare Reform Law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law establishes: 

&#160;

&#183; 

An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; 

&#160;

&#183; 

A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the &#8220;donut hole&#8221;); and 

&#160;

&#183; 

A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 

We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing. 

&#160;

Different pricing and reimbursement scheme s exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completi on of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward p ressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. 

Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. 

In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain &#8220;covered entities&#8221; (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 

In order to raise sufficient financial resources to continue to advance our product candidates, we will need to address pricing pressures and potential third-party reimbursement coverage for our product candidates. In the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payors, such 

&#160;

as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors are increasingly challe nging the prices charged for medical products and services. It is and will continue to be time-consuming and expensive for us or our strategic collaborators to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products m ay not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 

In many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control. 

Antibody Clinical Development 

We currently focus our research efforts primarily in the identification and isolation of human antibody drug candidates and further characterize these antibody candidates in in vitro and in vivo functional testing. Due to our limited financial resources, we intend to actively seek product development and commercialization partners from the biopharmaceuticals industry to help us advance the clinical development of select product candidates. 

Marketing and Sales

We currently do not have any clinical or commercial manufacturing or sales capabilities. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses, which are equipped to manufacture, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed manufacturing capabilities and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop. 

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

We currently use, and expect to continue the use of, contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). We intend to establish a quality control and quality assurance program, which will include a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations. 

We currently do not have any clinical or commercial antibody-based therapeutic manufacturing capabilities. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. We intend to use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 97 employees and 15 consultants and advisors. A significant number of our management and our other employees and consultants have worked or consulted with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development expenses totaled $31.3 million and $24.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Corporate Information 

On September 21, 2009, QuikByte Software, Inc., a Colorado corporation and shell company, or QuikByte, consummated its acquisition of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation and private concern, or STI, in a reverse merger, or the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of STI common stock were converted into an aggregate of 6,775,032 shares of QuikByte common stock and STI became a wholly owned subsidiary of QuikByte. The holders of QuikByte&#8217;s common stock immediately prior to the Merger held an aggregate of 2,228,333 shares of QuikByte&#8217;s common stock immediately following the Merger. 

&#160;

We were originally incor porated as San Diego Antibody Company in California in 2006 and were renamed &#8220;Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.&#8221; and reincorporated in Delaware in 2009, prior to the Merger. QuikByte was originally incorporated in Colorado in 1989. Following the Merger, on Decem ber 4, 2009, QuikByte reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;). Immediately following the Reincorporation, on December 4, 2009, we merged with and into QuikByte, the separate corporate existence of STI ceased and QuikB yte continued as the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Roll-Up Merger&#8221;). Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed in connection with the Roll-Up Merger, QuikByte&#8217;s name was changed from &#8220;QuikByte Software, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.&#8221; We formed Sorr ento Therapeutics, Inc. Hong Kong Limited effective December 4, 2012. Sorrento Hong Kong had no operations from formation through December 31, 2015.
