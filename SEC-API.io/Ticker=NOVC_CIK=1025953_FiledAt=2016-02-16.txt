 Item 1. Business 

Our Business 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 100% &#32;of Corvisa LLC ("Corvisa"), a developer and seller of cloud-based communication software under the CorvisaOne&#174; brand, telecommunications services, and implementation consulting services. On December 21, 2015, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Corvisa Services LLC ("Corvisa Services"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and ShoreTel, Inc. ("ShoreTel"), pursuant to which ShoreTel agreed to purchase all of the membership interests of Corvisa, subject to the terms and conditions under the Purchase Agreement. 

The sale of Corvisa was completed on January 6, 2016. The aggregate consideration for the transaction included approximately $8.4 million in cash, subject to a potential post-closing working capital adjustment, of which amount approximately $7.0 million was paid at the closing and the following was deposited in escrow: (i) $1.0 million for a period of twelve months to secure certain indemnification obligations of the Company; and (ii) $0.35 million to secure certain obligations of the Company in connection with the post-closing working capital adjustment. In connection with the closing of this transaction, the Company and ShoreTel also entered into a Transition Services Agreement and an Escrow Agreement. 

At ShoreTel&#8217;s request, the Company disposed of Corvisa&#8217;s third-party software implementation consulting business in December 2015. The Company sold the assets related exclusively to this business, including but not limited to customer contracts, computer hardware and marketing materials, to Canpango LLC (&#8220;Canpango&#8221;), which agreed to hire certain employees of the business, to assume Corvisa&#8217;s obligations under the customer contracts, and to pay to the Company a portion of the business&#8217;s existing accounts receivable collected in the next nine months, less associated collection costs. Canpango is led by a former employee of Corvisa, and certain current and former employees of Corvisa have financial interests in Canpango. The sales price, assets and operations related exclusively to this business were not material to the Company&#8217;s financial statements when taken as a whole. 

With the sale of Corvisa complete, the Company intends to continue its strategy of seeking to acquire operating businesses or make other investments that generate taxable earnings. As of the date the financial statements included in this report are issued, the Company has not yet identified any specific acquisition targets. 

On August 18, 2014, the Company sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data of its subsidiary, Advent Financial Services LLC (&#8220;Advent&#8221;), to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC, and announced that it would be conducting an orderly winding-down of the remaining business and operations of Advent; a financial settlement services provider for professional tax preparers nationwide. 

On April 16, 2014, the Company and the non-controlling members of StreetLinks LLC ("StreetLinks"), a national residential appraisal and mortgage real estate valuation management services company, entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant"), pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks. 

Prior to 2008, the Company originated, purchased, securitized, sold, invested in and serviced residential nonconforming mortgage loans and mortgage securities. Although those activities have been discontinued, as a result of those activities, the Company acquired and owns mortgage securities that continue to be a source of our cash flow. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company employed, directly or through subsidiaries, an aggregate of 115 full-time employees. With the sale of Corvisa, this number declined to approximately 18 employees. The Company anticipates further reductions in headcount as the accounting and other administrative services are transitioned to ShoreTel pursuant to the transition services agreement. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
