 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;AgroFresh&#148;, &#147;we&#148;, &#147;us&#148; or &#147;our&#148;) is a global agricultural innovator in proprietary technologies that preserve the quality and value of fresh produce, including apples, pears, kiwifruit, avocados, and bananas, as well as flowers. We have a strong, proven track record in apple storage solutions and are expanding our pre- and post-harvest applications with other varieties of produce. We expect to continue to grow through strategic expansion of our core franchise, the development of a robust pipeline of high-value solutions that preserve the quality and value of fresh produce, and the pursuit of related, accretive acquisitions. 

&#160; 

The SmartFresh&#153; Quality System (&#147;SmartFresh&#148;), our current principal product, regulates the post-harvest ripening effects of ethylene, the naturally occurring plant hormone that triggers ripening in certain fruits and vegetables, through proprietary technology. The active ingredient in this technology blocks the effects of ethylene. SmartFresh is naturally biodegradable and leaves no detectable residue, which has significant consumer appeal. We believe that SmartFresh preserves the texture, firmness, taste, and appearance of produce during storage, transportation, and retail display. SmartFresh allows growers and packers to deliver &#147;just harvested&#148; freshness on a year-round basis and retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh sales process is the AgroFresh Whole Product offering, which is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities combined with value-added advisory services. 

&#160; 

We are also investing in and launching new solutions that are expected to drive future growth. We have developed and launched our Harvista&#153; technology (&#147;Harvista&#148;) to apply our proprietary technology to pre-harvest management of pome fruit, such as apples and pears. Just as we believe SmartFresh revolutionized post-harvest apple storage, we expect Harvista can have a similar impact in the orchard. By keeping apples on the tree longer, Harvista extends the harvest window to promote better color and fruit size development, thereby bringing new benefits to the grower and the retailer. Our near-term product pipeline also includes AdvanStore&#153; technology (&#147;AdvanStore&#148;), which provides advanced monitoring of fresh fruit while in storage, and the RipeLock&#153; Quality System (&#147;RipeLock&#148;), a proprietary technology which extends the shelf life of bananas. 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulation. We have completed more than 80 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have approved 1-Methylcyclopropene (&#147;1-MCP&#148;) technology for use by workers and consumers, and in the environment. 1-MCP is degraded or metabolized by the natural processes in the apple and has been approved by domestic and global organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (the &#147;FAO&#148;), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#147;FDA&#148;), the European Chemicals Bureau and the Global Partnership for Good Agricultural Practice. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

We are a former blank check company that completed our initial public offering on February 19, 2014. On July 31, 2015 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;), we consummated a business combination (the &#147;Business Combination&#148;) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 30, 2015 (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;), with The Dow Chemical Company (&#147;Dow&#148;), providing for the acquisition by us of the AgroFresh business from Dow, resulting in AgroFresh Inc. becoming our wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary. On the Closing Date, we changed our name from Boulevard Acquisition Corp. to AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the business that now comprises our business was operated through a combination of wholly-owned subsidiaries and operations of Dow, including through AgroFresh Inc. in the United States. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our continued growth: 

&#160; 

Global Agricultural Innovator with Proprietary Technical Know-How and Solutions . We are an agricultural innovator in proprietary technologies that preserve the quality and value of fresh produce in over 40 countries. Our scientists and contract research staff are leaders in the field of post-harvest physiology. Since the launch of SmartFresh in 2002, we have developed an extensive and exclusive database on produce physiology and preferences of our more than 3,000 customers. Using this extensive proprietary technical expertise, SmartFresh delivers a step-change in storage solutions for apples, allowing for significantly less waste and greater productivity, as well as a constant supply of high quality fruit throughout the year. We believe the recently launched Harvista technology has the potential to have the same impact in the pre-harvest stage, allowing apple and pear growers the ability to better manage their harvest, reduce waste and improve fruit quality. With AdvanStore, we expect to be able to provide packers unparalleled information about the condition of their fruit while in cold storage using novel monitoring technologies. We believe that our storage solutions and portfolio of pre- and post-harvest service offerings

&#160; 

&#160; 

are well positioned to help address customer needs. 

&#160; 

Compelling Benefits for Value Chain . Consumer surveys have found that freshness is the most important driver of customer satisfaction with a supermarket&#146;s produce department. The ability to store produce longer while preserving just-harvested quality allows growers and packers to extend their marketing window and capitalize on seasonal pricing trends. We believe that SmartFresh revolutionized the apple industry by allowing growers and packers to meet year-round consumer demand for just-harvested quality. This extension of post-harvest life substantially increases the value of produce that is harvested on a seasonal basis but is sold to consumers throughout the year, particularly during the summer months when apple prices have historically peaked. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples, and can provide up to a 20-fold increase in value to the grower or packer over the cost of the service. Due to its high effectiveness and low cost relative to the value of the crop treated, we believe that SmartFresh provides compelling benefits across the value chain, from grower to retailer.

&#160; 

Unique Business Model with Sustainable Competitive Strengths . The AgroFresh Whole Product offering is a direct service model which comprises not only product applications but also &#147;mission critical&#148; advisory services. The AgroFresh product application uses a formulation of 1-MCP, an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of certain fresh produce, that is released into sealed storerooms using company-owned equipment. We have established a global footprint with operations in over 40 countries, allowing us to make over 34,000 monitored applications in 2015 alone. We currently have over 40 employees in research and development working in six AgroFresh locations around the world and at numerous research institutes and customer sites. This infrastructure investment has allowed us, over the past decade, to amass a proprietary database of technical data regarding the effective use of SmartFresh with a wide range of apple varieties in variable conditions. Our advisory services that are a part of the AgroFresh Whole Product offering utilize this information to assist customers in maximizing the profitability of their operations. We believe that our direct service model, extensive technical know-how, and brand loyalty will continue to sustain our competitive strengths.

&#160; 

Multiple Drivers of Future Growth . The market penetration of apples treated with SmartFresh outside the U.S. has been growing but has not yet reached the levels achieved in the U.S. We are increasing our sales and marketing efforts in non-U.S. regions to seek to capture these penetration opportunities and are working to apply SmartFresh to other crops, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, and bananas. Harvista extends our proprietary technology into pre-harvest management of apples and pears. Harvista is undergoing an expanded commercial launch in the U.S. We also achieved the first commercial sales for Harvista in Turkey in 2015 and seek to increase Harvista penetration in 2016. In addition, we are investing in and launching new solutions that we anticipate will drive continued business growth. AdvanStore offers atmospheric monitoring that storage operators are not capable of achieving with existing controlled atmosphere (&#147;CA&#148;) technology. This advanced monitoring system is being developed with our extensive understanding of fruit physiology, fruit respiration, current CA technology, and new proprietary diagnostic tools for measuring 1-MCP and other fruit volatiles and is designed to provide solutions to customers to help them protect the value of their crops. RipeLock combines 1-MCP with modified atmosphere packaging designed specifically for preserving the quality of bananas during transportation and extending their yellow shelf life for retailers and consumers.

&#160; 

High Customer Touch and Retention . Our personnel interact with our customers face to face year round&#151;from harvest to harvest, to address all aspects of post-harvest operations and a variety of customer specific issues. We offer customer specific programs designed to improve the economics of growers and packers. We believe that this, in turn, has produced a high level of customer retention and trust in the product efficacy and related support services that come with the AgroFresh Whole Product offering.

&#160; 

Proven Management Team . Over the last decade, our management team has proven its ability to bring profitable innovation to the fresh produce industry. The team has extensive agricultural industry experience, long-standing customer relationships, and a long track record of success in bringing valuable services and solutions to market. Commercial and technical experts are located in key geographies worldwide to provide on-site advisory services, which help customers optimize crop potential. We encourage an independent and entrepreneurial spirit among our management team and employees.

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Food Preservation and Freshness 

&#160; 

According to the FAO, over 1.3 billion tons of food, or approximately one third of the total food produced worldwide, is lost to spoilage or waste each year, including food valued at an estimated $48.3 billion in the U.S. alone. According to an October 2013 TESCO Consumer Study, nearly 45% of all fresh fruits and vegetables, including 40% of apples and 20% of bananas, are lost to spoilage. Loss or waste along the food supply chain has a variety of causes, including degradation of fresh produce during storage and transportation through the supply chain. 

&#160; 

Food waste is a major economic cost for retailers. A large percentage of food waste at the retail level is based on qualitative factors related to consumer perception of freshness. A consumer survey conducted by Oliver Wyman and Ipsos Interactive in the U.S. in 2007 indicated 

&#160; 

&#160; 

that freshness is the most important driver of customer satisfaction with a store&#146;s produce department. 

&#160; 

Pre-Harvest Treatments 

&#160; 

Pre-harvest treatments commonly used to increase the value of crops and reduce pre-harvest losses include plant growth regulators (&#147;PGRs&#148;). PGRs influence the rate of growth or development of crops or affect their reaction to stress events such as harsh weather. PGRs interact with the biochemical make-up of the plant and work by mimicking or blocking the production of naturally occurring plant hormones, like ethylene. Blocking the production of ethylene allows a grower to slow down the maturation of fruit to achieve better control over the timing of harvest. PGRs have a range of effectiveness depending on factors such as environmental conditions and the timing of application. 

&#160; 

Post-Harvest Treatments 

&#160; 

Post-harvest treatments to maximize quality and reduce loss include treatments to manage the effects of ethylene and to prevent microbial contamination. Naturally occurring ethylene triggers the acceleration of ripening in certain horticultural crops which results in a reduction of post-harvest life. 

&#160; 

One class of post-harvest treatments enhances quality and reduces losses by controlling the environment in which produce is stored. CA and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (&#147;DCA&#148;) systems are used to keep stored crops within their optimal ranges of temperature and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Specific oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can lower respiration in fresh produce and delay ripening. CA systems have been used for many decades with fruits and vegetables to preserve freshness. DCA, a more recent innovation, seeks to adjust levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide dynamically as the produce in storage breathes and matures. CA and DCA are only effective at preserving freshness while the fruit is kept in cold storage. However, 1-MCP treatments have been found to be complementary to these technologies by helping to better maintain the quality of apples during cold storage and maintaining freshness for up to 90 days after the apples are removed from cold storage. 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

We are an agricultural innovator in proprietary advanced technologies that enhance the freshness, quality, and value of fresh produce. We currently offer SmartFresh applications at customer sites through a direct service model utilizing third-party contractors. As part of the AgroFresh Whole Product offering, we also provide advisory services based on our extensive knowledge base on the use of 1-MCP collected through thousands of monitored applications done as a part of the AgroFresh Whole Product offering. We operate in over 40 countries and currently derive over 90% of our revenue working with customers to protect the value of apples, pears and other produce during storage. We also offer Harvista pre-harvest technology in the U.S., Turkey and Argentina. Line extensions and new services are planned for introduction to seek to strengthen our global position in post-harvest storage and to capitalize on adjacent growth opportunities in pre-harvest markets. 

&#160; 

The story of the AgroFresh business began with the discovery of the use of 1-MCP by research scientists at North Carolina State University in 1994. The technology was licensed by Rohm and Haas Company, which established the AgroFresh business and began commercializing 1-MCP as SmartFresh. Dow acquired Rohm and Haas Company in 2009. 

&#160; 

1-MCP Overview 

&#160; 

1-MCP, the active ingredient in SmartFresh and Harvista, is an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of certain fresh produce. The 1-MCP molecule is structurally similar to ethylene, a naturally occurring plant hormone that occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. Ethylene helps produce grow and ripen, but eventually causes over-ripening and spoilage. 1-MCP works by blocking the ethylene receptors in plant cells, which temporarily delays the ripening process, enabling the produce to better maintain the qualities associated with freshness. 

&#160; 

Today, two types of SmartFresh formulations are used to deliver 1-MCP into store rooms, powder and tablets. In a typical SmartFresh powder application, an AgroFresh service provider mixes a pouch of water-soluble powder with water in a SmartFresh generator and activates the generator to release the gaseous form of 1-MCP in the sealed storeroom. When using tablets, a service provider adds the tablets into a prepackaged formulated solution, the tablets dissolve in the solution and the gaseous form of 1-MCP is released in the storeroom. The gas released by either process mixes with the air circulating in the room, interacts with the fruit, and firmly binds to the fruit&#146;s ethylene receptor sites. 

&#160; 

Fruits and vegetables are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, a term referring to the process of fruit maturation. The climacteric event is a stage of fruit ripening associated with higher ethylene production and changes in the fruit including pigment changes and sugar release. For those climacteric fruits raised as food, the climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and texture for consumption. The role of SmartFresh is to delay the onset of the climacteric stage until the product is ready for consumption. Apples, pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmon, bananas, melons, peaches, and tomatoes are examples of climacteric fruit. Our management continues to evaluate the commercial value of 1-MCP with a range of other climacteric fruit. 

&#160; 

SmartFresh Value Proposition 

&#160; 

The value of SmartFresh with any crop is determined by both the biological efficacy with that crop and the utility value the application delivers to the customer. The biological efficacy with apples is high; apples are sensitive to ethylene and SmartFresh is effective at delaying ripening. In addition, SmartFresh brings high utility value by helping to keep apples fresh year-round despite their seasonal harvest. This set of attributes has increased the adoption of SmartFresh by apple growers and packers throughout the world. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples, providing significant economic value to customers. The price paid for SmartFresh is small relative to both the value of the crop and the importance of maintaining the quality of that crop during storage. The use of SmartFresh gives growers and packers the ability to store apples from one season to the next without losing their just picked quality characteristics. 

&#160; 

SmartFresh is particularly effective in preserving the quality of apples. Beneficial effects of SmartFresh have been proven across numerous apple varieties throughout the world. SmartFresh is also effective with other crops, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmons, avocados, and flowers, the latter marketed under the EthylBloc&#153; brand name and various private label brands. 

&#160; 

SmartFresh Service Model 

&#160; 

We believe that we have developed deep, trusted relationships with our customers by combining our effective SmartFresh product with application expertise and trusted advisory services. The AgroFresh Whole Product offering comprises this value-added service model. We made over 34,000 monitored applications in 2015 alone and, over the past decade, have amassed a valuable proprietary database of technical information on the best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh on a wide range of apple varieties. The advisory services component of the AgroFresh Whole Product offering utilizes this information to help maximize the profitability of our customers&#146; operations. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is highly seasonal, driven by the timing of harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres. The first half of the year encompasses the southern hemisphere harvest season and the second half of the year encompasses the northern hemisphere harvest season. Since the northern hemisphere harvest is typically larger, a significant portion of our sales and profits are historically generated in the second half of the year. In addition to this seasonality, factors such as weather patterns may impact the timing of the harvest within the two halves of the year. 

&#160; 

Our Other Products 

&#160; 

Harvista 

&#160; 

Harvista is a pre-harvest management product that brings ethylene management into the orchard. Harvista technology comprises several proprietary 1-MCP formulations that are specifically designed to keep fruit on the tree longer, which allows more color and size development. 

&#160; 

Harvista provides flexibility for fruit harvesters when it is needed the most &#151; within a few days before harvest or when bad weather strikes. Application in the period leading up to harvest allows the grower to better manage the optimal timing and scheduling of harvest. Application prior to, or following, a stress event such as bad weather helps to reduce the incidence of fruit drop triggered by these events, which can lower crop yields and cause significant economic loss. We believe the flexibility to apply treatment close to harvest provides growers using Harvista with valuable harvest management benefits compared to competing solutions using older technology that require applications well in advance of harvest. 

&#160; 

We believe that Harvista extends the &#147;ideal harvest window,&#148; the period during which fruit quality is at its peak, by keeping the fruit on the tree longer. For pome fruits, the ideal harvest window is typically up to seven days. The use of Harvista can triple the length of that window by extending it up to an additional 14 days. This added flexibility creates significant benefits both in terms of harvest logistics and crop profitability. Widening the harvest window allows for better scheduling and the optimization of limited resources, such as harvest crews and equipment. The extended harvest window can result in increased average size and weight of fruit. Overall, the value of the crop is enhanced by bigger average sizes, better color, and fewer defects. 

&#160; 

We offer Harvista technology for apples and pears through a pre-scheduled application service including aerial and/or ground applications. Typically, our technical staff designs the protocol in consultation with the customer, and third-party service providers (or in some cases the growers) make the applications. We are running a trial program in 2016 that will allow customers to make their own applications through 

&#160; 

&#160; 

AgroFresh owned sprayers. This will give orchard operators flexibility to manage the application timing to meet orchard conditions. 

&#160; 

Harvista applications were launched in the U.S. in 2012 in the Northwest region and in 2014 in the Eastern regions. Harvista was also launched in Turkey in 2015 and in Argentina in 2016. Management is currently compiling data for registration in ten more countries, which are expected to be completed on a country by country basis over the next six years, with additional registrations and label expansions expected to be pursued as new formulations and/or crop concepts are validated. 

&#160; 

AdvanStore 

&#160; 

Our AdvanStore platform is being designed to extend the AgroFresh Whole Product offering into monitoring the condition of produce during storage. We expect that these services will protect the value of the customer&#146;s investment by analyzing the atmosphere of a storage room to determine if, and provide advance notice when, there are conditions present that may be detrimental to the quality of the produce. The AdvanStore offering is expected to include the installation of advanced sensor equipment in a customer&#146;s facility that will provide &#147;real-time&#148; monitoring, analytics and feedback to enable the customer to more optimally manage the condition of the stored commodity. Through internal innovation and external alliances, the AdvanStore platform reflects our strategy to provide proprietary complete storage solutions to customers by leveraging our extensive knowledge of fruit physiology. Beta testing for AdvanStore will continue in 2016, with an anticipated launch in 2017. 

&#160; 

RipeLock 

&#160; 

RipeLock is an innovative fruit quality management system specifically designed for the banana industry. The patent-pending RipeLock system combines a specially-engineered, micro-perforated form of Modified Atmosphere Packaging (&#147;MAP&#148;) and a proprietary 1-MCP formulation. The combination of MAP with 1-MCP provides greater control over the ripening progression of bananas during shipping, distribution, and display. We believe that bananas handled with RipeLock technology retain their bright-yellow color, fresh taste, and appealing look for four to six days longer than untreated bananas. As a result, RipeLock maximizes the marketable &#147;yellow life&#148; of the fruit, providing economic benefits to brand owners and retailers. Commercial launch of RipeLock began in 2015, and the technology continues to progress through customer testing with brand owners, ripeners, food service companies and retailers in the U.S. and Europe. A full launch is expected during 2016. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Our mission is to provide technology, service and support targeted at preserving the quality, freshness and value of food, through the value chain, worldwide. We have a high touch, asset light, technology driven solutions philosophy. We intend to pursue profitable growth by building on our current capabilities and competencies, expanding into adjacent markets and pursuing related, accretive acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Our focus is to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Strengthen our brand awareness and loyalty through customer relationship programs, intellectual property protection and year round customer engagement. AgroFresh believes this focus, building on its philosophy of customer intimacy and its sustainable competitive advantages, will allow it to better secure and grow its current business.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Penetrate further both regionally and with short term cold storage opportunities. AgroFresh currently provides its offering to over 80% of US apples stored beyond 30 days. This percentage is much lower in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Penetration is typically driven by the pace of registrations, which were earliest in the U.S., and AgroFresh sees these other geographies presenting further opportunities for growth moving forward, as well as shorter term apple storage opportunities in all regions with existing customers.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Extend to other produce, including bananas, pears, and other crops that have the ethylene physiology which responds positively to SmartFresh. One example is RipeLock for bananas, our system to maintain &#147;yellow life&#148; and thus extend the bananas&#146; shelf life at retailers and in consumers&#146; homes. It is also effective at reducing split peel which is a significant problem in the industry. AgroFresh believes it will be able to provide a measurable extension of &#147;yellow life&#148; as well as prevent disorders like split-peel, both of which are highly desired value drivers throughout the supply chain, especially at retail and consumer levels where consistent quality is expected to increase sales.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Expand into other segments such as pre-harvest fruit quality management, fungal and microbial control solutions, diagnostics and storage management solutions. Opportunities include Harvista, which involves treating the produce before harvest, creating value for the grower through treated trees which retain their fruit longer, producing larger size, improved sugar development and better color, while also extending the picking window, allowing better harvest management, labor optimization, and fruit storage potential. Another opportunity is AdvanStore, our next storage

&#160; 

&#160; 

management solution, which is being developed to utilize our extensive knowledge of produce physiology and our extensive post-harvest quality performance database, to allow customers to have their rooms continually monitored with advanced sensing technology for various problematic volatiles and storage parameters, as well as to provide real-time dosage of SmartFresh and other offerings to optimize fruit quality and condition during storage. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Diversify and grow via alliances and accretive acquisitions, building on our numerous core competencies. AgroFresh anticipates proactively pursuing these opportunities.

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

We operate in more than 40 countries around the world. Currently, we use a single third party manufacturer, under a long-term contract that includes strong confidentiality obligations, to manufacture our key active ingredient, 1-MCP, and several other third parties, primarily to manufacture formulated products and provide product packaging services. We have no owned manufacturing facilities or manufacturing personnel. 

&#160; 

We operate under a service model for our commercially available products including SmartFresh and Harvista. Sales and sales support personnel maintain direct relationships with the customers in terms of sales, price and contract negotiations, and overall customer service. Technical sales and support personnel work directly with customers to provide value-added advisory services regarding the application of SmartFresh and Harvista. The actual application of SmartFresh and Harvista is performed by service providers that are typically third-party contractors. We plan to trial an orchard operator self-application of Harvista in areas where it is best fits the local practice. 

&#160; 

We have a dedicated customer service organization responsible for fulfilling customer-related requirements as well as coordinating all services being delivered by service providers. During the harvest season, temporary third-party resources are added to the customer service organization to support the high volume of transactions and activities. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Our sales structure is built on both a regional and country-by-country basis. Globally, the business is divided into three regions, each of which has a commercial leader who is a part of our leadership team: (i) North America, Australia, and New Zealand; (ii) EMEA and Asia Pacific; and (iii) Latin America. Each leader supervises commercial managers responsible for either a number of countries or an area with large key accounts. With a direct business model, the commercial team calls on end-user customers, not just dealers or distributors. They also work closely in the field with the service providers. 

&#160; 

Technical sales and development, the technical support group housed within research and development, supports the sales team. Technical sales support runs customer-specific trials for local apple varieties or specialized storage conditions and conducts follow-up with customers. These individuals work closely with customers to provide advice on appropriate protocols for SmartFresh and Harvista applications depending on crop, variety, region, and climatic conditions. The technical support group draws on our extensive knowledge base of 1-MCP applications across all regions and conditions. 

&#160; 

Marketing and communications functions are organized on a global and regional basis. The regional teams manage all product launches, advertising and trade shows, and are responsible for corporate brand stewardship and communications. The teams reach out to customers to keep them up to date on the latest research and news about AgroFresh products. Market research, including product penetration, collecting competitive intelligence and tracking other relevant market and industry information, is managed globally in conjunction with the regional teams. 

&#160; 

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015, 2014, or 2013. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for the use of 1-MCP is evolving and, in the near future, we expect to face growing competition as some of our patents expire over the next several years. We compete with other pre- and post-harvest crop preservation providers that have similar product claims and offer potential functional substitutes for our products. Current competitors include: dynamic controlled atmosphere storage companies, including Harvest Watch; Janssen Pharmaceutical and Pace International selling the Fysisum 1-MCP technology; and 1-MCP generic sellers such as AgroBest, Fitomag and several Chinese companies. ReTain is used pre-harvest for extending the harvest season across all regions with the exception of the European Union. We believe that the principal factors of competition in our industry include reputation, product quality, customer service and intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. We believe that we compete favorably with competitors on the basis of these and other factors. See the subsection titled &#147;Competitive Strengths&#148; above. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development plays an important role at AgroFresh in supporting customers as well as developing line extensions and new products. Approximately half of our research and development resources are located in facilities in North America, with the remainder across the other regions. Approximately 30% of the research and development organization&#146;s resources are composed of third-party contract resources. During fruit harvest times (August to November in the Northern Hemisphere and late January to early May in the Southern Hemisphere), we hire additional third-party contract scientists to assist with extensive testing of samples pulled from treated rooms. Most of the regional research and development facilities focus on customer trials and on further developing the extensive knowledge base of SmartFresh treatments. The remaining resources are prioritized against business aligned research and development initiatives to develop line extensions and create new products. Research and development makes use of core competencies in a number of technical areas including post-harvest physiology, analytical chemistry, regulatory sciences, regulatory affairs, formulation science, formulation process development, organic chemistry, and delivery systems. Initiatives focused on next generation solutions utilize expertise in molecular biology, microbiology, postharvest pathology, diagnostics and sensor technology. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We are a technology-based solutions provider and, as such, rely on a combination of important intellectual property strengths, including licenses, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property. We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential including, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process and SmartFresh service model. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property and/or our products protected by our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. 

&#160; 

We obtained an exclusive license from North Carolina State University (&#147;NCSU&#148;) under the Sisler patent (U.S. 5,518,988) for the use of 1-MCP to delay ripening of fruit and flowers. This patent has expired in the United States and in Europe and continues only in Japan until May of 2020. We also acquired the Daly patent (U.S. 6,017,849) for the encapsulation complex of 1-MCP and alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD), used as the foundational component in SmartFresh and Harvista. Depending on the country, SmartFresh is currently protected by a patent for the encapsulation complex through 2018 or 2019. We have also generated an impressive portfolio of intellectual property with over 30 patents granted in at least one country (pending in other countries) covering 1-MCP and next generation technologies, most of which do not expire until 2025 or beyond. RipeLock and Harvista formulations are patent protected through at least 2027. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Compliance 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulation, and we have a global network of highly-experienced regulatory consultants. Through this network, we have successfully obtained registrations for SmartFresh and Harvista in every country where the review process has been completed, and the registration process for Harvista continues in ten additional countries. As of December 31, 2015, we had completed more than 80 comprehensive international health and environmental tests and have obtained product registrations in 45 countries that have approved 1-MCP technology for use by workers and consumers, and in the environment. The product has been approved by domestic and global organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, FAO, FDA, the European Chemicals Bureau and the Global Partnership for Good Agricultural Practice. We do not anticipate any significant problems obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals that could negatively impact the ability to expand our business.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 156 employees. None of our employees in North America are members of a union or subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. In certain other countries where we operate (including Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain), employees are members of unions or are represented by works councils. In addition, certain of our activities have been performed historically by seasonal and part-time third-party contingent staff.
