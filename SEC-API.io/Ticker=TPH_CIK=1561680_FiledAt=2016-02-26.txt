Business 

Our Company 

TRI Pointe was founded in April 2009, towards the end of an unprecedented downturn in the national homebuilding industry. Since then, we have grown from a Southern California fee homebuilder into a regionally focused national homebuilder with a portfolio of the following six quality homebuilding brands operating in ten markets across eight states:

- 

Maracay Homes in Arizona; 

- 

Pardee Homes in California and Nevada; 

- 

Quadrant Homes in Washington; 

- 

Trendmaker Homes in Texas; 

- 

TRI Pointe Homes in California and Colorado; and 

- 

Winchester Homes in Maryland and Virginia. 

Our growth strategy is to capitalize on high demand in selected "core" markets with favorable population and employment growth as a result of proximity to job centers or primary transportation corridors. As of December 31, 2015, our operations consisted of 104 active selling communities and 27,602 lots owned or controlled. See "Lots Owned or Controlled" below. Our construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeal to a broad range of potential homebuyers, including entry-level, first time move-up and second-time move-up homes. As a result, we build across a variety of base sales price points, ranging from approximately $167,000 to $2.3 million, and home sizes, ranging from approximately 1,000 to 6,200 square feet. See "Description of Projects and Communities under Development" below. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we delivered 4,057 and 3,100 homes and the average sales price of our new homes delivered was approximately $565,000 and $531,000, respectively.

Our founders firmly established our core values of quality, integrity and excellence. These are the driving forces behind our innovative designs and strong commitment to our homebuyers. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following strengths provide us with a significant competitive advantage in implementing our business strategy:

Experienced and Proven Leadership 

Douglas Bauer, our Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Mitchell, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Michael Grubbs, our Chief Financial Officer, have worked together for over 25 years and have a successful track record of managing and growing a public homebuilding company. Spanning over a century, their combined real estate industry experience includes land acquisition, financing, entitlement, development, construction, marketing and sales of single-family detached and attached homes in communities in a variety of markets. In addition, each of the presidents of our homebuilding subsidiaries has substantial industry knowledge and local market expertise. The average homebuilding experience of these presidents exceeds 20 years. We believe that our management team's prior experience, extensive relationships and strong local reputation provide us with a competitive advantage in securing projects, obtaining entitlements, building quality homes and completing projects within budget and on schedule.

Focus on High Growth Core Markets 

Our business is well-positioned to capitalize on the broader national housing market recovery. We are focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative single-family detached and attached homes in major metropolitan areas in California, Colorado, Houston and Austin, Phoenix and Tucson, Las Vegas, the Washington, D.C. metro area and the Puget Sound region of Washington State. These markets are generally characterized by high job growth and increasing populations, creating strong demand for new housing. We believe they represent attractive homebuilding markets with opportunities for long-term growth and that we have strong land positions strategically located within these markets. Moreover, our management team has deep local market knowledge of the homebuilding and development industries. We believe this experience and strong relationships with local market participants enable us to source, acquire, and entitle land efficiently.

Strong Operational Discipline and Controls 

Our management team pursues a hands-on approach. Our strict operating discipline, including financial accountability at the project management level, is a key part of our strategy to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

Acquire Attractive Land Positions While Reducing Risk 

We believe that our reputation and extensive relationships with land sellers, master plan developers, financial institutions, brokers and other builders enable us to continue to acquire well-positioned land parcels in our target markets and provide us access to a greater number of acquisition opportunities. We believe our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target homebuyers' expectations, while operating at competitive costs.

Increase Market Position in Growth Markets 

We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand profitably in our existing and target markets, and we continually review our selection of markets based on both aggregate demographic information and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to re-allocate our investments to those markets where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital over the next several years. While our primary growth strategy has focused on increasing our market position in our existing markets, we may, on an opportunistic basis, explore expansion into other markets through organic growth or acquisition.

Provide Superior Design and Homeowner Experience and Service 

We consider ourselves a "progressive" homebuilder driven by an exemplary homeowner experience, cutting-edge product development and exceptional execution. Our core operating philosophy is to provide a positive, memorable experience to our homeowners through active engagement in the building process, tailoring our product to the homeowners' lifestyle needs and enhancing communication, knowledge and satisfaction. We believe that the new generation of home buying families has different ideas about the kind of home buying experience it wants. As a result, our selling process focuses on the home's features, benefits, quality and design in addition to the traditional metrics of price and square footage. In addition, we devote significant resources to the research and design of our homes to better meet the needs of our homebuyers. Through our "LivingSmart" platform, we provide homes that we believe are earth-friendly, enhance homeowners' comfort, promote a healthier lifestyle and deliver tangible operating cost savings versus less efficient resale homes. Collectively, we believe these steps enhance the selling process, lead to a more satisfied homeowner and increase the number of homebuyers referred to our communities.

Offer a Diverse Range of Products 

We are a builder with a wide variety of product lines that enable us to meet the specific needs of each of our core markets, which we believe provides us with a balanced portfolio and an opportunity to increase market share. We have demonstrated expertise in effectively building homes across product offerings from entry-level through first-time and second-time move-up housing. We spend extensive time studying and designing our products through the use of architects, consultants and homebuyer focus groups for all levels and price points in our target markets. We believe our diversified product strategy enables us to best serve a wide range of homebuyers, adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. Within each of our core markets we determine the profile of homebuyers we hope to address and design neighborhoods and homes with the specific needs of those homebuyers in mind.

Focus on Efficient Cost Structure and Target Attractive Returns 

Our experienced management team is vigilant in maintaining its focus on controlling costs. We competitively bid new projects and phases while maintaining strong relationships with our trade partners by managing production schedules closely and paying our vendors on time.

We combine decentralized management in those aspects of our business in which we believe detailed knowledge of local market conditions is critical (such as governmental processing, construction, land acquisition, land development and sales and marketing), with centralized management in those functions in which we believe central control is required (such as approval of land acquisitions, financial, treasury, human resources and legal matters). We have also made significant investments in systems and infrastructure to operate our business efficiently and to support the planned future growth of our company as a result of executing our expansion strategy.

- 7 -

Utilize Prudent Leverage 

Our ongoing financial strategy includes redeployment of cash flows from continuing operations and debt to provide us with the financial flexibility to access capital on the best terms available. In that regard, we expect to employ prudent levels of leverage to finance the acquisition and development of our lots and construction of our homes. See "Our Financing Strategy" below.

Lots Owned or Controlled 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled, pursuant to land option contracts or purchase contracts, an aggregate of 27,602 lots. We refer to lots that are under land option contracts as "controlled," see "Acquisition Process" below. Excluded from lots owned or controlled are those related to Note 8, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The following table presents certain information with respect to our lots owned or controlled as of December 31, 2015.

Sales prices reflect current pricing and might not be indicative of past or future pricing.

Acquisition Process 

We believe that our current inventory of lots owned or controlled will be adequate to supply our homebuilding operations for the foreseeable future.

- 16 -

Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps to reduce development and market cycle risk: 

- 

review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews; 

- 

limitation on the size of an acquisition to minimize investment levels in any one project; 

- 

completion of due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition; 

- 

preparation of detailed budgets for all cost categories; 

- 

completion of environmental reviews and third-party market studies; 

- 

utilization of options, joint ventures and other land acquisition arrangements, if necessary; and 

- 

employment of centralized control of approval over all acquisitions through a land committee process. 

Before purchasing a land parcel, we also engage outside architects and consultants to help review our proposed acquisition and design our homes and communities.

We acquire land parcels pursuant to purchase agreements that are often structured as option contracts. These option contracts require us to pay non-refundable deposits, which can vary by transaction, and entitle (but do not obligate) us to acquire the land typically at fixed prices. The term within which we can exercise our option varies by transaction and our acquisition is often contingent upon the completion of entitlement or other work with regard to the land (such as "backbone" improvements, which include the installation of main roads or sewer mains). Depending upon the transaction, we may be required to purchase all of the land involved at one time or we may have a right to acquire identified groups of lots over a specified timetable. In some transactions, a portion of the consideration that we pay for the land may be in the form of a share of the profits of a project after we receive an agreed upon level of profits from the project. In limited instances such as when we acquire land from a master developer that is part of a larger project, the seller may have repurchase rights entitling it to repurchase the land from us under circumstances when we do not develop the land by an outside deadline (unless the delay is caused by certain circumstances outside our control), or when we seek to sell the land directly to a third party or indirectly through a change in control of our company. Repurchase rights typically allow the seller to repurchase the land at the price that we paid the seller to acquire the land plus the cost of improvements that we have made to the land and less some specified discount.

Our Community Development, Construction and Sales and Marketing Process 

Community Development

In California, we typically develop community phases based upon projected sales, and we construct homes in each phase whether or not they have been pre-sold. We have the ability to control the timing of construction of subsequent phases in the same community based on sales activity in the prior phase, market conditions and other factors. We also will attempt to delay much of the customization of a home until a qualified homebuyer has been approved, so as to enable the homebuyer to tailor the home to that homebuyer's specifications; however, we will complete the build out of any unsold homes in a particular phase when deemed appropriate for marketing purposes of such home. In our other regions, we typically develop communities on a lot by lot basis driven by sales demand. 

The design of our homes is limited by factors such as zoning requirements, building codes and energy efficiency laws. As a result, we contract with a number of architects and other consultants in connection with the design process.

Construction

Substantially all of our construction work is done by subcontractors with us acting as the general contractor. We also enter into contracts as needed with design professionals and other service providers who are familiar with local market conditions and requirements. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with our subcontractors, suppliers or laborers. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with many of our subcontractors. We believe that our relationships have been enhanced through both maintaining our schedules and making timely payment to our subcontractors. By dealing fairly with our key subcontractors, we are able to keep them attentive to our projects.

Sales and Marketing 

In connection with the sale and marketing of our homes, we make extensive use of online and offline advertising and other promotional activities, including digital paid search and display advertising, the website of each of our six regional brands, print media advertisements, brochures, direct mail and the placement of signboards in the immediate areas of our developments.

- 17 -

We sell our homes through our own sales representatives and through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential homebuyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, a nd the selection of options. Sales personnel are licensed by the applicable real estate bodies in their respective markets, are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcont racted marketing and design consultants, carefully design exteriors and interiors of each home to coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 252 model homes that were either completed or under construction. Generally, we build model homes at each project and have them professionally decorated to display design features. We believe that model homes play a significant role in helping homebuyers understand the efficiencies and value provided by each floor plan type. Interior decorations vary among our models and are selected based upon the lifestyles of our targeted homebuyers. Structural changes in design from the model homes are not generally permitted, but homebuyers may select various other optional construction and design amenities. In addition to model homes, homebuyers can gain an understanding of the various design features and options available to them using design centers. At each design center, homebuyers can meet with a designer and are shown the standard and upgraded selections available to them.

We typically sell homes using sales contracts that include cash deposits by the purchasers. However, purchasers can generally cancel sales contracts if they are unable to sell their existing homes, if they fail to qualify for financing, or under certain other circumstances. Although cancellations can delay the sale of our homes, they have historically not had a material impact on our operating results. The cancellation rate of homebuyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow (as a percentage of overall orders) was consistent at 16% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cancellation rates are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control such as adverse economic conditions and increases in mortgage interest rates. Our inventory of completed and unsold production homes was 351 and 288 homes as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Homebuyer Financing and Title Services

We seek to assist our homebuyers in obtaining financing by arranging with mortgage lenders to offer qualified homebuyers a variety of financing options. Substantially all homebuyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers. Our financial services operation ("TRI Pointe Solutions") is comprised of mortgage financing operations ("TRI Pointe Connect"), which was formed as a joint venture with an established mortgage lender, and title services operations ("TRI Pointe Assurance"). While our homebuyers may obtain financing from any mortgage provider of their choice, TRI Pointe Connect can act as a preferred mortgage broker to our homebuyers in all of the markets in which we operate, providing mortgage financing that helps facilitate the sale and closing process as well as generate additional fee income for us. TRI Pointe Assurance provides title examinations for our homebuyers in our Trendmaker Homes and Winchester Homes brands. TRI Pointe Assurance is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRI Pointe and acts as a title agency for First American Title Insurance Company.

Quality Control and Customer Service 

We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. We monitor the quality and workmanship of the subcontractors that we employ and we make regular inspections and evaluations of our subcontractors to seek to ensure that our standards are met.

We maintain quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each homebuyer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, delivery and post-delivery periods. These employees are also responsible for providing after sales customer service. Our quality and service initiatives include taking homebuyers on a comprehensive tour of their home prior to delivery and using homebuyer survey results to improve our standards of quality and homebuyer satisfaction.

Warranty Program 

In the normal course of business, we incur warranty-related costs associated with homes that have been delivered to homebuyers. Estimated future direct warranty costs are accrued and charged to cost of sales in the period when the related home sales revenues are recognized while indirect warranty overhead salaries and related costs are charged to cost of sales in the period incurred. Estimation of accruals include consideration of our claims history, including current claims and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. We also periodically utilize the services of an independent third party actuary to assist us with evaluating the level of our accruals. Factors that affect the warranty accruals include the number of homes delivered, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. Although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. Our warranty accrual is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

- 18 -

We maintain general liability insurance designed to protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction-related claims. We also g enerally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work, subject to various limitations. However, such indemnity is significantly limited with respect to certain subcontractors that are added to our general liability insurance policy. We record expected recoveries from insurance carriers when proceeds are probable and estimable. Warranty insurance receivables are recorded in receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

There can be no assurance that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by homebuyers, that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that we will not be liable for damages, cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with certain subcontractors.

Seasonality 

We have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically take orders for more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry and the geographic mix of the homes we sell.

Backlog

Backlog units reflects the number of homes, net of actual cancellations experienced during the period, for which we have entered into a sales contract with a homebuyer but for which we have not yet delivered the home. Homes in backlog are generally delivered within three to nine months, although we may experience cancellations of sales contracts prior to delivery. For information concerning backlog units, the dollar value and average sales price by segment, see Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Raw Materials 

Typically, all of the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started or other market conditions could cause delays in the delivery of, shortages in, or higher prices for necessary materials. Delivery delays or the inability to obtain necessary materials could result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We have established national purchase programs for certain materials and we continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available.

Our Financing Strategy 

We intend to employ both debt and equity as part of our ongoing financing strategy, coupled with redeployment of cash flows from continuing operations, to provide us with the financial flexibility to access capital on the best terms available. In that regard, we expect to employ prudent levels of leverage to finance the acquisition and development of our lots and construction of our homes. As of December 31, 2015, we had $299.4 million outstanding related to our unsecured revolving credit facility, $2.4 million of seller financed loans and $868.7 million of outstanding senior notes as well as $214.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $242.2 million available under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our board of directors considers a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets and the ability of particular assets, and our company as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. As a means of sustaining our long-term financial health and limiting our exposure to unforeseen dislocations in the debt and financing markets, we currently expect to remain conservatively capitalized. However, our charter does not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.

We intend to finance future acquisitions and developments with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of common and preferred equity, secured and unsecured corporate level debt, property-level debt and mortgage financing and other public, private or bank debt.

- 19 -

Segments 

The Company's operations are organized in two principal businesses: homebuilding and financial services.

Our homebuilding operation consists of six reportable segments: Maracay Homes, consisting of operations in Arizona; Pardee Homes, consisting of operations in California and Nevada; Quadrant Homes, consisting of operations in Washington; Trendmaker Homes, consisting of operations in Texas; TRI Pointe Homes, consisting of operations in California and Colorado; and Winchester Homes, consisting of operations in Maryland and Virginia. 

Our financial services operation (TRI Pointe Solutions) is a reportable segment and is comprised of our TRI Pointe Connect mortgage financing operations and our TRI Pointe Assurance title services operations. 

For financial information about our segments, see Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 4, Segment Information , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or "slow-growth" or "no-growth" initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees and exactions for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site's location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders' compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that as concerns about climate change and other environmental issues continue to grow, homebuilders will be required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. California is especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. In addition, home deliveries in California may be delayed or prevented due to governmental responses to California’s long-term drought, even when we have obtained water rights for those projects.

Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation system may be installed during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition such as methane. Some homebuyers may not want to purchase a home with a mitigation system.

Our general contractor, real estate broker, mortgage joint venture and title agency operations are subject to licensing and regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Consequently, they are subject to net worth, bonding, disclosure, record-keeping and other requirements. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in loss of license, financial penalties, or other sanctions.

Competition 

Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete for homebuyers primarily on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including home design and location, price, homebuyer satisfaction, construction quality, reputation and the availability of mortgage financing. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, several of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have longer operating histories and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than ours; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,036 employees, 435 of whom were executive, management and administrative personnel, 251 of whom were sales and marketing personnel and 350 of whom were involved in field construction. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the subcontractors engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
