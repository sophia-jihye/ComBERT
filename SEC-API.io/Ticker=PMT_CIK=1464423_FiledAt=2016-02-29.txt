 Item 1. Business The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Report. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the projections and results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors described under the caption &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and elsewhere in this Report. References in this Report to &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;PMT,&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148; refer to PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. 

Our Company 

We are a specialty finance company that invests primarily in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets. We were organized in Maryland on May 18, 2009, and began operations on August 4, 2009. We conduct our operations through two segments: correspondent production and investment activities. For financial information concerning our reportable segments see Note 33, Segments and Related Information , in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We conduct substantially all of our operations, and make substantially all of our investments, through PennyMac Operating Partnership, L.P. (our &#147;Operating Partnership&#148;) and its subsidiaries. A wholly-owned subsidiary of ours is the sole general partner, and we are the sole limited partner, of our Operating Partnership. 

The management of our business and execution of our operations is performed on our behalf by subsidiaries of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (&#147;PFSI&#148; or &#147;PennyMac&#148;). PFSI is a specialty financial services firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing of U.S. residential mortgage loans and the management of investments related to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Specifically: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We are managed by PNMAC Capital Management, LLC (&#147;PCM&#148; or our &#147;Manager&#148;), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PennyMac and an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) that specializes in, and focuses on, U.S. residential mortgage assets. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All of the loans we acquire in our correspondent production operations (as described below) are fulfilled on our behalf by another indirect wholly-owned PennyMac subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC (&#147;PLS&#148; or our &#147;Servicer&#148;), which also services the loans we hold in our residential mortgage investment portfolio and the loans for which we retain the obligation to service as a result of our correspondent production. Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our investors over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. Our targeted investments are in the U.S. mortgage market, including credit sensitive assets such as distressed mortgage loans, credit risk transfer (&#147;CRT&#148;) securities related to our correspondent production, non-Agency subordinate bonds, small-balance commercial real estate (including multifamily) loans and subordinate interests; and interest rate sensitive assets such as MSRs, ESS, MBS, and non-Agency senior MBS. 

In addition to our investment activities, we are engaged in correspondent production, which is the acquisition of newly originated, prime credit quality, first-lien residential mortgage loans that have been underwritten to investor guidelines, pooling such loans into MBS and selling the resulting securities into the secondary markets. We purchase Agency-eligible loans and jumbo loans. A jumbo loan is a loan in an amount that exceeds the maximum loan amount for eligible loans under Agency guidelines. We then sell or securitize Agency-eligible loans meeting the guidelines of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a servicing-retained basis whereby we retain the related MSRs; government loans (insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA), which we sell to PLS, a Ginnie Mae approved issuer and servicer; and jumbo mortgage loans, which, generally on a servicing-retained basis, we securitize or sell to third parties. 

&#160;

Our correspondent production business has grown through purchases from approved mortgage originators that meet specific criteria related to management experience, financial strength, risk management controls and loan quality. The management team at PLS has prior experience with the majority of these mortgage originators. As of December 31, 2015, 432 sellers have been approved, primarily independent mortgage originators and small banks located across the United States. We purchased approximately $46.4 billion at fair value of loans in 2015, including $14.4 billion of conventional loans and $31.9 billion of government-insured loans. In the third quarter of 2015, we were the third largest correspondent lender in the United States as ranked by Inside Mortgage Finance. 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and we intend to maintain our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Therefore, we are required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in loans secured by real estate and in real estate-related assets. Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification and our Investment Company Act exclusion, we do not have any limitations on the amounts we may invest in any of our targeted asset classes. 

Our Manager and Our Servicers 

We are externally managed and advised by PCM pursuant to a management agreement. PCM specializes in and focuses on residential mortgage loans. PCM also serves as the investment manager to two private investment funds, which we refer to as the PennyMac funds, with investment objectives and policies relating to distressed mortgage loans that are substantially similar to ours. The combined net assets of the entities managed by PCM, including our shareholders&#146; equity, amounted to approximately $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2015. 

PCM is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, including developing our investment strategies, sourcing and acquiring mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets for our investment portfolio, and developing the appropriate approach to be taken by PLS for each loan as it performs its specialty servicing. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, PCM provides us with our senior management team, including our officers and support personnel. PCM is subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of trustees and has the functions and authority specified in the management agreement. 

Our Manager&#146;s senior management team has extensive experience in the residential mortgage industry and expertise across each of the critical capabilities that we believe are required to successfully acquire and manage both performing and nonperforming mortgage loans, including sourcing, valuation, due diligence, portfolio strategy, servicing (including modification and refinance fulfillment of outstanding loans and acquisition and liquidation of properties securing settled mortgage loans) and secondary marketing. 

We also have a loan servicing agreement with PLS, pursuant to which PLS provides primary and special servicing for our portfolio of residential mortgage loans. PLS&#146;s loan servicing activities include collecting principal, interest and escrow account payments, if any, with respect to mortgage loans, as well as managing loss mitigation, which may include, among other things, collection activities, loan workouts, modifications and refinancings, foreclosures, short sales and sales of real estate owned properties (&#147;REO&#148;). Servicing fee rates are based on the delinquency status and other characteristics of the mortgage loans serviced and total servicing compensation is established at levels that our Manager believes are competitive with those charged by other primary servicers and specialty servicers. PLS also provides special servicing to the PennyMac funds and the entities in which the PennyMac funds have invested. PLS acted as the servicer for mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (&#147;UPB&#148;) of approximately $160.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. 

We have a commercial mortgage loan servicing agreement with Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association (&#147;Midland&#148;), pursuant to which Midland provides the master servicing for commercial mortgage loans that we acquire and may also provide special servicing, as necessary. We also have a commercial mortgage loan servicing oversight agreement with PLS, pursuant to which PLS provides oversight of Midland, including vendor management, review of reports and procedures for accuracy and timeliness, and monitoring Midland&#146;s activities and performance. 

&#160;

Investment Strategy and Targeted Asset Classes 

Our Manager continually evaluates the markets for investment opportunities on our behalf. To date, we have invested in mortgage loans, a substantial portion of which are distressed and acquired at discounts to their unpaid principal balances; MSRs; ESS; mortgage-related securities; small balance (typically under $10 million) commercial real estate loans; and other mortgage-related, real estate and financial assets. We also expect to invest in newly originated multifamily loans. A substantial portion of our investments are not rated by any rating agency. 

Our targeted asset classes and the principal investments we make and/or expect to make in each class are as follows: 

&#160;

Asset class 

&#160; Principal investments 

Credit Sensitive Assets 

&#160; &#149; Distressed loan investments (including REO) 

&#160; &#149; GSE credit risk transfer

&#160; &#149; Non-Agency subordinate bonds

&#160; &#149; Small balance (typically under $10 million) commercial real estate loans that finance multifamily and other commercial real estate or securities backed by such loans

Interest Rate Sensitive Assets &#160; &#149; MSRs

&#160; &#149; ESS arising from MSRs (including recapture)

&#160; &#149; Agency MBS

&#160; &#149; Non-Agency senior MBS

&#160; &#149; Mortgage-related derivatives, including, but not limited to, options, futures and derivatives on MBS

&#160; &#149; United States Treasury securities

Over time, our targeted asset classes may change as a result of changes in the opportunities that are available in the market, among other factors. We may not invest in certain of the investments described above if we believe those types of investments will not provide us with attractive opportunities or if we believe other types of our targeted assets provide us with better opportunities.

Correspondent Production 

In our correspondent production activities, we acquire newly originated loans from mortgage lenders, sell the loans to an Agency or other third party, sell the loans to PLS in the case of government loans, or otherwise pool loans into MBS, sell the resulting securities into the MBS markets and retain the MSRs. During 2015, we purchased $46.4 billion at fair value of newly originated mortgage loans, compared to $28.4 billion during 2014. 

Following is a summary of our correspondent production activities:

(1) Gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale includes the initial MSR capitalization, recognition of initial and changes in the fair value of commitments to purchase loans (&#147;IRLCs&#148;), changes in the fair value of mortgage loans purchased during the period from purchase through the date of sale and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments acquired to manage the risk of changes in fair value of our inventory of mortgage loans and IRLCs. PCM has worked to expand our sources of assets to position us to take advantage of market opportunities and market changes. Examples of such investments, which are in various stages of analysis, planning or implementation, include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Creation and acquisition of MSRs and ESS related to MSRs. We believe that MSR and ESS investments may allow us to earn attractive current returns and to leverage the mortgage loan servicing and origination capabilities of PLS to enhance the assets&#146; value. We intend to continue to retain the MSRs that we receive as a portion of the proceeds from our sale or securitization of mortgage loans through our correspondent production operation. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Recapture of MSRs. Pursuant to the terms of the MSR recapture agreement entered into with PFSI effective February 1, 2013, if PFSI refinances mortgage loans for which we previously created and held the MSRs through our correspondent production activities, PFSI is generally required to transfer and convey to us, at no cost to us, the MSRs with respect to new mortgage loans originated in those refinancings (or, under certain circumstances, other mortgage loans) that have an aggregate unpaid principal balance that is not less than 30% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all the mortgage loans so originated. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Acquisition of small balance (typically under $10 million) commercial real estate loans that finance multifamily and other commercial real estate or securities backed by such mortgage loans. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; To the extent that we transfer correspondent production mortgage loans into private label securitizations, we may retain a portion of the securities and residual interests created in such securitization transactions. We expect our future securitizations will be accounted for as secured borrowings. Our Financing Strategy 

We have pursued growth of our investment portfolio by using a combination of equity and borrowings, generally in the form of borrowings under agreements to repurchase. We use borrowings to finance our investments and not to speculate on changes in interest rates. 

During 2014, we issued 3.8 million common shares under an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement sm and received net proceeds totaling $89.6 million. During 2015 and 2013, we did not issue our common shares under this or any other agreement. We used the proceeds of the 2014 offerings to fund a portion of the purchase price of our mortgage-related investments, to fund the continued growth of our correspondent production business and for general corporate purposes. 

&#160;

Our board of trustees has authorized a common share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 1.0 million common shares at a cost of $16.3 million. The repurchased common shares were canceled upon settlement of the repurchase transactions and returned to the authorized but unissued share pool. 

Since 2010, we have maintained multiple master repurchase agreements with money center banks to finance our investments in distressed assets. Our objective is to use these facilities to finance nonperforming mortgage loan and real estate investments pending liquidation, sale, securitization or other structured financing. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the facilities in existence as of December 31, 2015 was $1.6 billion. 

Since 2010, we have also maintained multiple master repurchase agreements with money center banks to fund newly originated prime mortgage loans purchased from correspondent lenders. The aggregate principal balance outstanding under the facilities in existence as of December 31, 2015 was $1.1 billion. 

In 2013, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PennyMac Corp. (&#147;PMC&#148;), issued in a private offering $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#147;Exchangeable Notes&#148;). The net proceeds were used to fund our business and investment activities, including the acquisition of distressed mortgage loans or other investments; the funding of the continued growth of our correspondent production business, including the purchase of jumbo loans; the repayment of other indebtedness; and general corporate purposes. 

In 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PennyMac Holdings, LLC (&#147;PMH&#148;) entered into a loan and security agreement with PLS, pursuant to which PMH may borrow up to $150 million from PLS for the purpose of financing ESS. The principal amount of the borrowings under the loan and security agreement is based upon a percentage of the market value of the ESS pledged by PMH, subject to the maximum loan amount described above. Pursuant to the loan and security agreement, PMH grants to PLS a security interest in all of its right, title and interest in, to and under the ESS pledged to secure loans and PLS, in turn, re-pledges such ESS under a repurchase agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital LLC (&#147;CSFB&#148;) (the &#147;MSR Repo&#148;). Under the MSR Repo and subject to a separate acknowledgement agreement by and among Ginnie Mae, CSFB and PLS, PLS finances Ginnie Mae MSRs and servicing advance receivables and pledges to CSFB all of its rights and interests in any Ginnie Mae MSRs it owns or acquires (inclusive of our ESS relating to a portion of such pledged Ginnie Mae MSRs). 

Our borrowings are made under agreements that include various covenants, including profitability, the maintenance of specified levels of cash, adjusted tangible net worth and overall leverage limits. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is limited by the amount of qualifying assets that we hold and that are eligible to be pledged to secure such borrowings. We are not otherwise required to maintain any specific debt-to-equity ratio, and we believe the appropriate leverage for the particular assets we finance depends on, among other things, the credit quality and risk of such assets. Our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur, and our board of trustees has discretion to deviate from or change our financing strategy at any time. 

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act, we may hedge the interest rate risk associated with the financing of our portfolio. 

Investment Policies 

Our board of trustees has adopted the policies set forth below for our investments and borrowings. PCM reviews our compliance with the investment policies regularly and reports periodically to our board of trustees regarding such compliance. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; No investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; No investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; With the exception of real estate and housing, no single industry shall represent greater than 20% of the investments or aggregate risk exposure in our portfolio. These investment policies may be changed by a majority of our board of trustees without the approval of, or prior notice to, our shareholders. 

&#160;

Investment Allocation Policy 

Investment opportunities in pools of mortgage loans that are consistent with our investment objectives, on the one hand and the investment objectives of the PennyMac funds and other future entities or accounts managed by PCM, on the other hand, have been and will be allocated among us and the PennyMac funds and the other entities or accounts generally on a pro rata basis. This is and has been based upon relative amounts of investment capital (including undrawn capital commitments) available for new investments by us, the PennyMac funds and any other relevant entities or accounts, or by assigning opportunities among the relevant entities such that investments assigned among us, such funds, entities or accounts are fair and equitable over time; provided that PCM, in its sole discretion, may allocate investment opportunities in any other manner that it deems to be fair and equitable. As of December 31, 2011, the commitment periods for the PennyMac funds had ended and the ability of the PennyMac funds to make new investments has therefore been significantly reduced. 

As the investment programs of the various entities and accounts managed by PCM change and develop over time, additional issues and considerations may affect PCM&#146;s and our allocation policy and PCM&#146;s and our expectations with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among the various entities and accounts managed by PCM. Notwithstanding PCM&#146;s intention to effect fair and equitable allocations of investment opportunities, we expect that our performance will differ from the performance of the PennyMac funds and any other PennyMac-managed entity or account for many reasons, including differences in the legal or regulatory characteristics, or tax classification, of the entities or accounts or due to differing fee structures or the idiosyncratic differences in the outcome of individual mortgage loans. 

We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our trustees, officers, shareholders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. However, our code of business conduct and ethics contains a conflicts of interest policy that prohibits our trustees and officers, as well as employees of PennyMac and its subsidiaries who provide services to us, from engaging in any transaction that involves an actual or apparent conflict of interest with us without the appropriate approval. We also have written policies and procedures for the review and approval of related party transactions, including oversight by designated committees of our board of trustees and PFSI&#146;s board of directors. 

Operating and Regulatory Structure 

REIT Qualification 

We have elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#147;Internal Revenue Code&#148;) beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2009. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our common shares. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and that our manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Accordingly, our failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders. 

Even though we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we are subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. A portion of our business is conducted through, and a portion of our income is earned in, our TRS that is subject to corporate income taxation. In general, a TRS of ours may hold assets and engage in activities that we cannot hold or engage in directly and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. To maintain our REIT election, at the end of each quarter no more than 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of a REIT&#146;s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. 

If our TRS generates net income, our TRS can declare dividends to us, which will be included in our taxable income and necessitate a distribution to our shareholders. Conversely, if we retain earnings at the TRS level, no distribution is required and we can increase shareholders&#146; equity of the consolidated entity. As discussed in Section 1A of this Report entitled Risk Factors , the combination of the requirement to maintain no more than 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) of our assets in the TRS coupled with the effect of TRS dividends on our income tests creates compliance complexities for us in the maintenance of our qualified REIT status. 

&#160;

The dividends paid deduction of a REIT for qualifying dividends to its shareholders is computed using our taxable income as opposed to net income reported on our financial statements. Taxable income generally differs from net income reported on our financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax laws and regulations and not financial accounting principles. 

Licensing 

We and PLS are required to be licensed to conduct business in certain jurisdictions. PLS is, or is taking steps to become, licensed in those jurisdictions and for those activities where it believes it is cost effective and appropriate to become licensed. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we are also licensed, or are taking steps to become licensed, in those jurisdictions and for those activities where we believe it is cost effective and appropriate to become licensed. In jurisdictions in which neither we nor PLS is licensed, we do not conduct activity for which a license is required. Our failure or the failure by PLS to obtain any necessary licenses promptly, comply with applicable licensing laws or satisfy the various requirements or to maintain them over time could materially and adversely impact our business. 

Competition 

In our correspondent production activities, we compete with large financial institutions and with other independent residential mortgage loan producers and servicers. We compete on the basis of product offerings, technical knowledge, manufacturing quality, speed of execution, rate and fees. 

In acquiring mortgage assets, we compete with specialty finance companies, private funds, other mortgage REITs, thrifts, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, governmental bodies and other entities, which may also be focused on acquiring mortgage related assets, and therefore may increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have stronger financial positions and greater access to capital and other resources than we have and may have other advantages over us. Such advantages include the ability to obtain lower-cost financing, such as deposits, and operational efficiencies arising from their larger size. Some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the operating restraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from the Investment Company Act, any of which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and funding strategies and to establish more relationships with sellers of mortgage assets than we can. 

Because the availability of pools of mortgage assets may fluctuate, the competition for assets and sources of financing may increase. Increased competition for assets may result in our accepting lower returns for acquisitions of residential mortgage loans and other assets or adversely influence our ability to &#147;win&#148; our bids for such assets. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and terms of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common shares. 

In the face of this competition, we have access to PCM&#146;s professionals and their industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. We expect these relationships to enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Furthermore, we believe that our access to PFSI&#146;s special servicing expertise helps us to maximize the fair value of our distressed residential mortgage loans and provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies with a similar focus. We believe that current market and regulatory conditions may have adversely affected the financial condition and operations of certain owners of mortgage assets. Further, regulatory and capital issues have contributed to the decision by certain financial institutions to exit or curtail their correspondent production business and to reduce their portfolios of MSRs. Not having a legacy portfolio or the same regulatory or capital issues may enable us to compete more effectively for attractive business or investment opportunities. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive and other risks that we face. 

Staffing 

We have no employees, and we do not pay our officers any cash compensation. All of our officers are employees of PennyMac or its affiliates. Under the terms of our management agreement, we pay PCM management fees quarterly in arrears, which include a &#147;base&#148; component and an &#147;incentive&#148; component. In addition, we pay PLS fees for servicing our loans and providing mortgage banking services in support of our correspondent production activities, and we reimburse PCM and its affiliates for certain direct costs incurred on our behalf and for certain overhead expenses.
