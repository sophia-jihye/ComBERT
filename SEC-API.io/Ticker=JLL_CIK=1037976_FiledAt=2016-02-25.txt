 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated ("Jones Lang LaSalle," which we may refer to as "JLL," "we," "us," "our," the "Company" or the "Firm") was incorporated in 1997. Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "JLL." 

We are a Fortune 500 &#32;financial and professional services firm specializing in real estate. We offer comprehensive integrated services on a local, regional, and global basis to owner, occupier, investor, and developer clients seeking increased value by owning, occupying, or investing in real estate. We have more than 280 corporate offices worldwide from which we provide services to clients in more than 80 countries. We have over 60,000 employees, including 32,700 employees whose costs our clients reimburse. Our issuer and senior unsecured ratings are investment grade: BBB+ (stable outlook) from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services ("S&#38;P") and Baa2 (positive outlook) from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody&#8217;s"). 

Over the ten years ended December 31, 2015, the fee revenue of the Firm has grown at a 14% compound annual growth rate. We have grown our business by expanding our client base and the range of our services and products, both organically and through a series of strategic acquisitions and mergers. Our extensive global platform and in-depth knowledge of local real estate markets enable us to serve as a single-source provider of solutions for the full spectrum of our clients' real estate needs. We began to establish this network of services across the globe through the 1999 merger of the Jones Lang Wootton companies ("JLW", founded in England in 1783) with LaSalle Partners Incorporated ("LaSalle Partners", founded in the United States in 1968). 

We use JLL as our principal trading name. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated remains our legal name. JLL is a registered trademark in the countries in which we do business, as is our logo: 

Using the shorter JLL name in the marketplace is a natural evolution of the firm's historically rich brand, recognizing that it is a truly global company located in multiple markets, with a wide range of expertise applied through many different client services. It also represents its adaptation to different communication styles in different countries, languages and channels, and especially the use of digital and online channels for marketing and communications. 

JLL delivers an array of Real Estate Services ("RES") across three geographic business segments: (1) the Americas, (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and (3) Asia Pacific. 

LaSalle Investment Management, which uses LaSalle as its principal trading name, is a wholly-owned member of the Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated group and our fourth business segment. LaSalle is one of the world's largest and most diversified real estate investment management firms. Over the ten years ended December 31, 2015, the assets under management have grown from $30.0 million to $56.4 billion , a 6.5% compound annual growth rate. LaSalle is a registered trademark in the countries in which we conduct business, as is our logo: 

In 2015, we generated record-setting fee revenue of $5.2 billion &#32;across our four business segments, a 17% &#32;increase over 2014 in local currency. We believe we remain well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in a consolidating industry and to navigate successfully the dynamic and challenging markets in which we compete worldwide. 

We are proud to be a preferred provider of global real estate services, an employer of choice, a consistent winner of industry awards, and a valued partner to the largest and most successful companies and institutions in the global marketplace.

JLL History and Acquisition Activities 

Prior to our incorporation in Maryland in April 1997 and our initial public offering (the "Offering") of 4,000,000 shares of common stock in July 1997, JLL conducted its real estate services and investment management businesses as LaSalle Partners Limited Partnership and LaSalle Partners Management Limited Partnership (collectively, the "Predecessor Partnerships"). Immediately prior to the Offering, the general and limited partners of the Predecessor Partnerships contributed all of their partnership interests in the Predecessor Partnerships in exchange for an aggregate of 12,200,000 shares of common stock. 

In March 1999, LaSalle Partners merged its business with that of JLW and changed its name to Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated. In connection with the merger, we issued 14,300,000 shares of common stock and paid cash consideration of $6.2 million. 

Since &#32; 2005, we have completed more than 80 acquisitions as part of our global growth strategy. These strategic acquisitions have given us additional share in key geographical markets, expanded our capabilities in certain service areas, and further broadened the global platform we make available to our clients. These acquisitions have also increased our presence and product offering globally, and have included acquisitions in the following countries:

In a multi-step acquisition starting in 2007, we acquired the former Trammell Crow Meghraj ("TCM"), one of the largest privately held real estate services companies in India. We have combined TCM's operations with our Indian operations and we now operate under the JLL brand name throughout India. 

In May 2008, we acquired Kemper's Holding GmbH, making us the largest retail property advisor in Germany. 

In July 2008, we acquired Staubach Holdings Inc. ("Staubach"), a U.S. real estate services firm specializing in tenant representation. Staubach, with 1,000 employees, significantly enhanced our presence in key markets across the United States and made us an industry leader in local, national and global tenant representation. The acquisition also established us as the market leader in public sector services and added scale to our industrial brokerage, investment sales, corporate finance and project and development services. 

In May 2011, we completed the acquisition of King Sturge, a United Kingdom-based international property consultancy. The King Sturge acquisition, which extended our historical roots back to its founding in 1760, significantly enhanced the strength and depth of our service capabilities in the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, adding approximately 1,400 employees.

Value Drivers for Providing Superior Client Service and Prospering as a Sustainable Enterprise 

Our mission is to deliver exceptional strategic fully-integrated services, best practices, and innovative solutions for real estate owners, occupiers, investors, and developers worldwide. We deliver a combination of services, expertise, and technology applications on an integrated global platform that we own (and do not franchise), the totality of which we believe distinguishes us from our competitors and contributes to service excellence and customer loyalty. While we face high-quality competition in individual markets, we believe the following attributes make us the best choice for clients seeking real estate and investment management services on a worldwide basis: 

&#8226; 

We have the size and scale of resources necessary to deliver the expertise of the Firm wherever clients need it; 

&#8226; 

Our culture of client service, teamwork, and integrity means that we can marshal those resources to deliver the greatest possible value and results; 

&#8226; 

Our "client first" and ethical orientation means that our people focus on how we can best provide what our clients need and want, with integrity and transparency; 

&#8226; 

Our governance and enterprise risk management orientation means that we have built an enterprise that clients can rely on over the long-term; 

&#8226; 

Our strong intellectual capital, our long-term approach to business, and our ability to anticipate, interpret, and respond to the trends influencing our industry sector mean that we are quick and nimble in adapting to new challenges and opportunities in a fast changing world and in helping our clients to do the same. 

In their totality, these aspects affirm our commitment to sustaining our business over the long term. We seek to successfully manage the financial, environmental and social risks and opportunities our complex organization faces, and help our clients do the same. Under the new title, Building A Better Tomorrow ( sm ), during 2016 we will be reorganizing our sustainability communications and strategy globally. 

Global Governance Structure 

To achieve our mission, we must establish and maintain an enterprise that will sustain itself over the long term for the benefit of all of our stakeholders: clients, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities, among others. Accordingly, we have committed ourselves to effective corporate governance that reflects best practices and the highest level of business ethics. For a number of years, we have governed the organization through a highly coordinated framework within which decisions are deliberated and corporate authority is derived. 

GLOBAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 

To continue to create on-going value for our clients, shareholders, and employees, both from current and longer-term perspectives, we have identified five strategic priorities, which we call the G5. We have consistently used the G5 approach since 2005. Although we have grown significantly over the past decade, we believe we have a substantial opportunity to continue to grow and prosper by providing our core services within our key markets, whose potential remains large given the global magnitude of commercial and residential real estate, broadly defined. From time to time we may add adjacent services that are not part of our historical core functions, but we intend these to be opportunistic in nature and targeted to individual geographical locations and evolving business opportunities. For example, we successfully expanded the cross-border brokerage of high-end residential properties in London with the 2011 King Sturge merger, followed by the acquisition of W.A. Ellis during 2014 and Guardian in Dublin in 2015. We have expanded the Tetris-branded fit-out business we originally acquired in France and have been introducing it into other countries, including through acquisitions in Portugal in 2014 and in Poland, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 2015. In 2015, we enhanced our service offering for facility management clients by acquiring a cloud-based technology platform called Corrigo. 

We regularly re-evaluate whether the G5 continue to be the right priorities for best driving the business forward toward the overall objective of on-going value creation. 

G1: Build our Leading Local and Regional Service Operations 

Our strength in local and regional markets contributes to the strength of our global service capabilities. Our financial performance also depends, in great part, on the business we source and execute locally from our more than 280 wholly-owned offices around the world. We continually seek to leverage our established business presence in the world's principal real estate markets to provide expanded and adjacent local and regional services without a proportionate increase in infrastructure costs. We believe these capabilities will continue to fuel our competitive advantage and make us more attractive to current and prospective clients, as well as to revenue-generating employees such as brokers and client relationship managers. 

Metrics: &#32;During 2015, we completed approximately 35,500 transactions for landlord and tenant clients, a 6% increase over 2014, representing 1.1 billion square feet of space. 

G2: Strengthen our Leading Position in Corporate Solutions 

The accelerating trends of globalization, cost cutting, energy management and the outsourcing of real estate services by corporate occupiers support our decision to emphasize a truly global Corporate Solutions business that serves the comprehensive needs of corporate clients. This service delivery capability helps us create new client relationships, particularly as companies turn to outsourcing their real estate as a way to manage expenses and to implement sustainable practices. These services have proved to be counter-cyclical, as we have seen demand for them strengthen when the economy has weakened. 

Metrics: During 2015, we provided corporate facility management services for 1.3 billion square feet of clients' real estate, a 17% increase from 2014. Over the same period, JLL had 137 new business wins, 75 expansions of existing relationships and 35 contract renewals. 

G3: Capture the Leading Share of Global Capital Flows for Investment Sales 

Our focus on further developing our ability to provide global Capital Markets services reflects the increasingly international nature of cross-border money flows into real estate and the global marketing of real estate assets. Our real estate investment banking capability helps provide capital and other financial solutions by which our clients can maximize the value of their real estate. 

Metrics: During 2015, we provided capital markets services for $138 billion of client transactions, a 17% increase from 2014. 

G4: Strengthen LaSalle Investment Management's Leadership Position 

With its integrated global platform, LaSalle is well-positioned to serve institutional investors looking for attractive real estate investment opportunities around the globe. LaSalle also continues to develop its ability to serve individual retail investors, particularly in the U.S. and Japan. LaSalle develops and implements strategies based on a thorough understanding of investor objectives and knowledge of local market risks and rewards. We intend to continue to maintain strong offerings in core products to meet the demand from clients who seek lower risk investments in the most stable and mature real estate markets. In addition, we continue to strengthen our capabilities in value-add, opportunistic and debt strategies to meet the diverse range of our clients' objectives. 

Metrics: At the end of 2015, LaSalle had assets under management of $56.4 billion, an increase of 5% over 2014, while raising $5.0 billion of capital. 

G5: Connections: Differentiate and Sustain the Organization by Connecting Across the Firm and with Clients and other Stakeholders 

Connecting. To create real value and new opportunities for our clients, shareholders, and employees, we regularly work to strengthen and fully leverage the links between our people, service lines, and geographies to better connect with our clients and put the Firm's global expertise and experience to work for them. This includes constantly striving to strengthen our data and analytics capabilities, and to leverage use of the Internet and emerging social media to gather, analyze, and disseminate information that will be useful to our clients, employees, vendors, and other constituencies. Linking our operations effectively to make service delivery more efficient not only serves client needs, it also contributes to our profitability and enhances our ability to identify and manage the enterprise risks inherent in our business. 

Differentiating and Sustaining. We also recognize that the value we deliver to our clients, shareholders, employees, and the global community closely relates to our Firm's people, brand, ethics, and technology. As a professional services company, the focus on our people is paramount. Because our human capital contributes strongly to high-quality client service, this includes a focus on areas such as: employee satisfaction; health, safety and well-being; training and career development and rewards and recognition; and diversity and inclusion. Coupled with a strong brand and high ethical standards, our active role as good corporate citizens enables our long-lasting presence. Our use of technology to provide information to our clients and to improve the ability of our people play an undeniable role in maximizing our clients' real estate value, shaping our industry's response to global challenges such as market risk, climate change and urbanization. These values and culture help us embed sustainability principles throughout the enterprise and successfully differentiate us from our competition, therefore ensuring we continue our more than 250-year history. 

Metrics: Our Employee Engagement Index, which measures the percentage of survey respondents reporting high levels of engagement with the Firm and their work reached 76% as measured in 2015, up 3 percentage points from 2012, the last time we completed a full survey. Substantially all of the results in the survey improved over 2012 and also were higher than the global norms reported by our independent survey provider. 

From Google Analytics, we understand our website received over 20.5 million page views by more than 4.8 million visitors in 2015. 

Future Development of the G5 

We have committed resources to each of the G5 priorities in past years and expect to continue to do so in the future. This strategy has helped us weather economic downturns, continue to grow market share, expand our services by developing adjacent offerings, and take advantage of new opportunities. 

Our strategic review has validated the continued potential for our G5 priorities to drive the long-term sustained growth of our firm and deliver real value to our clients. To derive the full advantage of that potential, we recognize the need to accelerate the development of the G5 to meet the challenges of our dynamic markets and the specific themes we have identified such as globalization and urbanization. We will do this by targeting our efforts and capital resources to: 

&#8226; 

Deploy innovative technology that allows our people to mine the depth of our intellectual property to provide the most sophisticated possible advice and service to our clients. 

Examples: &#32;HiRise ( sm ), Blackbird ( sm ) and RED systems bring digital capabilities for managing real estate needs directly to clients in multiple ways (all available on-line through our public website). 

&#8226; 

Apply best practices in human resources to supply our businesses with well-trained, engaged and diverse employees and create an overall culture that serves to retain our top talent. 

Examples: &#32;Develop and implement a new electronic learning management system by Human Resources for use globally. 

&#8226; 

Promote an updated and modern brand that fully leverages our digital capabilities and clearly reflects the breadth of our expertise, wisdom, governance and integrity. 

Examples: &#32;Adapting the JLL and LaSalle names and refreshing their logos; acquiring the rights to the dot jll (.jll) and dot lasalle (.lasalle) top-level domain names. 

&#8226; 

Establish and standardize tools and processes that make our operations highly productive and minimize losses from enterprise risk. 

Examples: &#32;Implementing significant new document management system for legal and other client documentation in our Corporate Solutions business. 

By continuing to invest in the future based on how our strengths can support the needs of our clients, we intend to enhance our position as an industry leader. Although we have validated our fundamental business strategies, each of our businesses continually re-evaluates how it can best serve our clients as their needs change, as technologies and the application of technologies evolve, and as real estate markets, credit markets, economies, and political environments exhibit changes, which in each case may be dramatic and unpredictable. 

STRATEGY 2020: OUR FUTURE ORIENTATION 

During 2015, we continued to implement our Strategy 2020, which we first launched to identify specific business and operational strategies we believe will best drive the continued success of the G5 priorities over the longer term. They include: 

&#8226; 

Employing an investment philosophy and filters that are focused on growth that will best meet client needs and concentrate on the most lucrative potential services, markets and cities; 

&#8226; 

Establishing charters for internal business boards with responsibility for promoting more inter-connected global approaches, where appropriate, to client services and delivery; 

&#8226; 

Using technology, including emerging digital, Internet and social media capabilities, to provide information to clients to help them maximize the value of their real estate portfolios and to mine and apply our knowledge to improve the ability of our people to provide superior client services; 

&#8226; 

Deploying additional tools and metrics that will make our people as productive and efficient as possible; 

&#8226; 

Determining how best to marshal, train, recruit, motivate and retain the human resources that will have the skill sets, diversity and other abilities necessary to accomplish our strategic objectives; 

&#8226; 

Continuing to develop our brand and reputation for high quality client service, integrity and intimate local and global market knowledge; 

&#8226; 

Building our brand in digital and social media channels; and 

&#8226; 

Continuing to promote best-in-class governance, compliance, enterprise risk management and professional standards to operate a sustainable organization capable of meeting the significant challenges and risks inherent in global markets and to minimize disruptions to, and distractions from, the accomplishment of our corporate mission. 

Viewed as complementary strategies, the G5 and Strategy 2020 work in combination to provide both short- and long-term paths to sustained success for our Firm. 

As a professional services organization, the principal capitals we deploy are (1) human resources enabled by (2) intellectual property in the form of market knowledge, technology, innovation, and a reputation for quality, expertise, and integrity that is reflected by the strength of our brand, and (3) financial resources. Our Strategy 2020 review confirmed that the historical approach we have taken to our business should sustain us in the future. We believe there is ample room for growth within our core markets and competencies without having to resort to particularly different business lines to continue to grow and prosper as a business organization. We will, however, maintain an open mind about moving into adjacent businesses where local teams identify specific opportunities, as our clients and industry evolve, and as new technologies develop that could support our business. 

We also believe that our historical approach to growth through a combination of organic development of talent and opportunistic acquisitions continues to be the best overall approach for us. Our business model has natural risk mitigation benefits derived from the diversity of our geographic presence, asset classes served, and complementary service lines. This diversity also provides revenue streams that have both short-term transactional and longer-term annuity characteristics. 

During 2015, we continued to devote significant efforts and resources to implement our 2020 strategies and priorities through the deployment of cross-functional workstreams that have engaged our leadership globally. We expect these workstreams to continue for the foreseeable future and we have put a mechanism in place for both our Board of Directors and our Global Executive Board to monitor and influence their progress on a regular basis. 

Our Strategy 2020 identified particular challenges we will need to confront to successfully achieve its goals: 

&#8226; 

In terms of our financial capital, we recognize the challenge of maintaining healthy short-term profit margins while continuing to invest in the further growth of the business. As there is constant fee pressure from our clients that is inherent in a competitive professional services environment, we need to continue to find new ways to increase the productivity of our people so that we can drive higher revenue per person. Additional productivity can be derived by improved application of technology, by continuous process improvements, and through increased staff well-being and training and development, among other techniques. 

Example: &#32;We now report revenues per professional in our quarterly operating reviews to senior management. 

&#8226; 

In terms of our human capital, we recognize that our investments in talent will continue to be a primary method of creating long-term value and that continuing business growth will necessitate the growth and increased flexibility and diversity of our workforce. This can be a challenge, particularly in emerging markets, where the available pool of talent does not necessarily have the skill sets we need. Consequently, we may need to establish our own training programs beyond what is typically required for companies in developed markets. Increased reliance on third-party suppliers may create challenges in terms of due diligence, performance management, and ensuring that third-party personnel have the same level of commitment and integrity as we demand from our own people. In developed markets, the challenge of growing a workforce with the requisite skill sets can be frustrated by the targeted efforts of competitors to hire away our people, including sometimes by offering above-market compensation. 

Example: &#32;We now report diversity statistics in our quarterly operating reviews to senior management. 

&#8226; 

In terms of our intellectual capital, we recognize the challenge of continuing to identify innovations through which we can provide increasingly valuable services to our clients, including as the result of developing, identifying, and successfully applying new technologies to our business processes. We also must confront the challenges inherent in managing and mining the significant data in our systems so that it can be made useful to our people and maximized in terms of our ability to analyze it in a sophisticated way for the benefit of our clients. As we develop our intellectual capital, we need to make sure our brand, and the awareness it generates in the marketplace, keeps pace with our capabilities and the messages we want associated with them in the minds of current and prospective clients, employees, and other third parties in the business community and society at large. 

Example: &#32;Our U.S. business runs an annual innovation competition to identify cutting-edge approaches that will benefit clients, which we then evaluate in terms of potential patent applications. 

INTEGRATED REPORTING 

Initially as a pilot company from 2012-2014 and now as a part of the business network of the International Integrated Reporting Council ("IIRC"), we support the general principles designed to promote communications and integrated thinking about how an organization's strategy, governance, and financial and non-financial performance lead to the creation of value over the short, medium and long term. This Annual Report on Form 10-K focuses on our business strategy and our financial performance, including an initial attempt to illustrate how being a sustainable enterprise is integral to our success. Our citizenship and sustainability efforts for ourselves and our clients are reflected primarily in our annual Global Sustainability Report . 

Our governance and remuneration practices are reported primarily in the Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The mechanisms we use to provide confidence to our clients with respect to our transparency and fair dealing are summarized in our Transparency Report, which we first published in 2013. The behaviors and standards we expect of our employees and of the suppliers we engage for our own firm and on behalf of clients are presented in our Code of Business Ethics and our Vendor Code of Conduct. Our Corporate Facts document is intended to provide an overall summary of the information we believe will be of primary interest to our different stakeholders. 

We intend this Annual Report to satisfy the requirements of the International &#60;IR&#62; Framework issued by the IIRC in December, 2013 ( www.theiirc.org ). Following the Exhibit Index, we present a tie-out sheet that cross-references the requirements in the Framework and the locations of our responses within this Annual Report. 

We have recently launched an electronic Integrated Report on our website which provides access to all of our information embedded in the documents discussed above through one access portal. 

Responsibility for Integrated Reporting. The Finance and Legal Services functions of our Company are primarily responsible for the integrity of our integrated reporting efforts and acknowledge that we have applied a collaborative approach in the preparation and presentation of this report. To do so, we have also engaged the members of our Global Operating Board ("GOB" ) , which consists of the leaders of our corporate staff functions in addition to others and is described below in more detail, with respect to the preparation of the information presented in Items 1 (Business) and 1A (Risk Factors). In our collective opinion, this report is presented in accordance with the Framework. However, as our effort to comply with the Framework is done voluntarily, we disclaim any legal liability to the extent that this report is deemed to not comply with the Framework. 

Alignment with the Integrated Reporting Framework. &#32;Building on the Strategy 2020 and as an important part of our aim to align more closely with the Integrated Reporting Framework, we began to identify the medium- to long-term global megatrends with the greatest potential to impact materially upon our business. To do this, we used the 'six capitals' model advocated by the International Integrated Reporting Council, namely financial, human, intellectual, manufactured, social, and natural capitals. 

While we are most heavily dependent on the financial, human, and intellectual capitals to execute our own operations successfully, we identified significant trends with implications for our business across all six capitals. Furthermore, changes in the availability of all six capitals impact our clients&#8217; businesses, and by extension, our service provision. An example in 2015 was the effect of significantly lower oil prices on the financial ability of energy-related companies to improve their real estate assets. Through internal consultation, we identified a number of trends as significant for our business in the medium to long term. All of these "Global Trends," which we are tracking and/or actively managing, are illustrated below. The "JLL Activities," which address these trends, are summarized in the table below primarily via a combination of references to (1) sections within Items 1 and 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and (2) resources we publish on our website, where we discuss relevant points in more detail.

Our Materiality Process. In 2014, JLL identified its long-term risks and opportunities with a view to furthering our integrated reporting journey. This effort complemented our Enterprise Risk Management processes; enabled further engagement with internal executives; prioritized our long-term risks and opportunities to generate further business value based on the IIRC&#8217;s guidance; and will help us articulate how we are managing and taking advantage of long-term risks and opportunities in reports like this and in our sustainability reporting. 

We used the &#8216;six capitals&#8217; model from the IR Framework to identify and investigate a number of global trends with the potential to impact our business. These trends covered financial, human, manufactured, intellectual, social and natural capitals. This process helped us to identify where and how different trends interact with one another. Using this model, we created an initial list of 36 trends and their potential implications for JLL. We then undertook one-to-one engagements with around 30 executives across the firm from different disciplines and geographies to present the six capitals model; discuss the trends identified; and to understand, based on these trends, what the potential risks and opportunities are to JLL and how we are, or should be, responding to them. We were then able to develop a comprehensive qualitative analysis based on these internal engagements. Working with our Internal Audit team, we developed a quantitative analysis aligned with our existing risk management matrix. We scored the long-term trends according to likelihood and magnitude, taking account of potential impact on different areas of the business. The result of this scoring is the six capitals risks and opportunities materiality matrices, shown below, which allowed us to identify the most material long-term risks and opportunities for our company.

SUSTAINING OUR ENTERPRISE: A BUSINESS MODEL THAT COMBINES CAPITALS TO CREATE STAKEHOLDER VALUE 

We have designed our business model to (1) create value for our clients, shareholders, and employees and (2) establish high-quality relationships with the suppliers we engage and the communities in which we operate. Our synergistic approach seeks to derive business benefits from the application and intersection primarily of human resources, financial capital, and intellectual capital and technology. Based on our intimate knowledge of local real estate and capital markets worldwide, as well as our investments in thought leadership and technology, we create value for clients by addressing their real estate needs as well as their broader business, strategic, operating, and longer-term sustainability goals. Given the increasingly global and interconnected marketplace in which many of our clients compete, our own capacity to deliver global solutions has also become more important to our business model. 

We strive to create a healthy and dynamic balance between (1) activities that will produce short-term value and returns for our stakeholders through effective management of current transactions and business activities and (2) investments in people (such as new hires), acquisitions, technologies and systems designed to produce sustainable returns over the longer-term. 

Our financial strength and our reputation for integrity, strong governance, and transparency, which we believe are among the strongest in the industry, give our clients confidence in our long-term ability to meet our obligations to them. It also positions us to be trusted extensions for the ways in which they seek to do business for the benefit of their own stakeholders. During 2015, we were included on the Ethisphere Institute's list of The World's Most Ethical Companies and we were listed as #20 on CR Magazine's list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. 

The ability to create and deliver value to our clients drives our revenue and profits, which in turn allows us to invest in our business and our people, improving productivity and shareholder value. In doing so, we enable our people to advance their careers by taking on new and increased responsibilities within a dynamic environment as our business expands geographically, adds adjacent service offerings and develops new competencies. We are also increasingly able to develop and expand our relationships with suppliers of services to our own organization as well as to our clients, for whom we serve a significant intermediary role. By expanding employment both internally and to outsourced providers, we stimulate economically the locations in which we operate, and we increase the opportunities for those we directly or indirectly employ to engage in community services and other activities beneficial to society. 

We apply our business model to the resources and capitals that we employ to provide services to assets owned or occupied by our clients. We provide these services through our own employees and, where necessary or appropriate in the case of property and facility management and project and development services, through the management of third-party contractors. The revenue and profits we earn from those efforts are divided between further investments in our business, employee compensation, and returns to our shareholders. We are increasingly focused on linking our business and sustainability strategies to promote the goal of creating long-term value for our shareholders, clients, employees, and the global community of which our firm is a part. These efforts help our clients manage their real estate more effectively and efficiently, promote employment globally, and create wealth for our shareholders and employees. In turn, they allow us to be an increasingly impactful member of, and positive force within, the communities in which we operate. 

The following diagram summarizes how we create value for our shareholders and our broader stakeholders. It starts with the capital resources &#8211; or inputs &#8211; we need to do business. We use these resources to deliver services &#8211; or outputs &#8211; for our clients through a number of business activities we closely manage. 

The resources we use are broadly comparable to many other professional services firms globally. What makes JLL unique is that we provide real value in a changing world: both through the implementation of our G5 business strategy and the medium-term Strategy 2020 to mitigate the impact of risks of future volatility on our business model. 

Finally, there are outcomes of our business model, which can be both positive and negative. We realize that these outcomes will eventually become our resources once again, so our business model is designed in a way that keeps our impact low and our influence on quality resources high. Ultimately, this business model shows how we seek to derive long-term profit by the sustainable use of all resources. 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

We report our operations as four business segments. We manage our RES product offerings geographically as (1) the Americas, (2) EMEA and (3) Asia Pacific, and we manage our investment management business globally as (4) LaSalle. 

There are significant risks inherent in conducting a global business. We describe these in detail below in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Information regarding revenue and operating income or loss, attributable to each of our segments, is included in &#8220;Segment Operating Results&#8221; within Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and within Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

REAL ESTATE SERVICES: AMERICAS, EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC 

To address the needs of real estate owners and occupiers, we provide a full range of integrated property and facility management, project management, advisory and transaction services locally, regionally, and globally through our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments. We organize our RES in five major product categories: 

&#8226; 

Leasing; 

&#8226; 

Capital Markets and Hotels; 

&#8226; 

Property and Facility Management; 

&#8226; 

Project and Development Services; and 

&#8226; 

Advisory, Consulting and Other Services. 

Across these five broad RES categories, we leverage our deep real estate expertise and experience within the Firm to provide innovative solutions for our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived our RES revenue from product categories and regional geographies as follows ($ in millions and showing change from 2014 in local currency): 

For Property &#38; Facility Management, Project &#38; Development Services and total RES revenue, the table above shows "Fee Revenue," or revenue net of vendor and subcontract costs that are otherwise included both in revenue and expense ("gross contract costs") for reporting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that excluding gross contract costs from revenue in this presentation gives a more accurate picture of the revenue growth rates in these RES product categories. 

RES Revenue Mix by Business Lines and Geographies 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our global total fee revenue of $4.8 million was generated as follows: 

&#32; 

In the Americas, our total RES operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was derived from the following countries in the proportions indicated below: 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

In EMEA, our total RES operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was derived from the following countries in the proportions indicated below: 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

In Asia Pacific, our total RES operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was derived from the following countries in the proportions indicated below: 

These product categories, and the services we provide within them, include: 

1. Leasing Services 

Agency Leasing Services &#32;executes marketing and leasing programs on behalf of investors, developers, property companies and public entities to secure tenants, and negotiate leases with terms that reflect our clients' best interests. In 2015, we completed approximately 18,100 agency leasing transactions representing 714 million square feet of space. We typically base our agency leasing fees on a percentage of the value of the lease revenue commitment for consummated leases, although in some cases they are based on a dollar amount per square foot leased. 

Tenant Representation Services &#32;establishes strategic alliances with clients to deliver ongoing assistance to meet their real estate needs and to help them evaluate and execute transactions in line with their occupancy requirements. Tenant Representation Services is also an important component of our local market services. We assist clients by defining space requirements, identifying suitable alternatives, recommending appropriate occupancy solutions, negotiating lease and ownership terms with landlords and reducing real estate costs for clients through analyzing, structuring and negotiating business and economic incentives. We help our clients lower their real estate costs, minimize real estate occupancy risks, improve occupancy control and flexibility, and create more productive office environments. We employ a multi-disciplinary approach to develop occupancy strategies linked to our clients' core business objectives. 

We determine Tenant Representation Services fees on a negotiated fee basis. In various markets, landlords may be responsible for paying them. Fees sometimes reflect performance measures related to targets that we and our clients establish prior to engagement or, in the case of strategic alliances, at future annual intervals. We use quantitative and qualitative measurements to assess performance relative to these goals, and we may be awarded incentive fees for superior performance. In 2015, we completed approximately 17,400 tenant representation transactions representing 426 million square feet of space. 

2. Property and Facility Management 

Property Management Services &#32;provides on-site management services to real estate owners for office, industrial, retail, multifamily residential and specialty properties. We seek to leverage our market share and buying power to deliver superior service and value to clients. Our goal is to enhance our clients' property values through aggressive day-to-day management. We may provide services through our own employees or through contracts with third-party providers. We focus on maintaining high levels of occupancy and tenant satisfaction while lowering property operating costs. During 2015, we provided on-site property management services for properties totaling approximately 2.7 billion square feet. 

We typically provide property management services through an on-site general manager and staff. We support them with regional supervisory teams and central resources in such areas as training, technical and environmental services, accounting, marketing, and human resources. Our general managers are responsible for property management activities, client satisfaction and financial results. We do not compensate them with commissions, but rather with a combination of base salary and a performance bonus that is directly linked to results they produce for their clients. In some cases, management agreements provide for incentive compensation relating to operating expense reductions, gross revenue or occupancy objectives, or tenant satisfaction levels. Consistent with industry custom, management contract terms typically range from one to three years, although some contracts are terminable at will at any time following a short notice period, usually 30 to 120 days, as is typical in the industry. 

Integrated Facility Management Services &#32;provides comprehensive portfolio and facility management services to corporations and institutions that outsource the management of the real estate they occupy. Facilities under management range from corporate headquarters to industrial complexes. During 2015, Integrated Facility Management Services managed approximately 1.3 billion square feet of real estate for its clients. Our target clients typically have large portfolios (usually over one million square feet) that offer significant opportunities to reduce costs and improve service delivery. The competitive trends of globalization, outsourcing, and offshoring have prompted many of these clients to demand consistent service delivery worldwide and a single point of contact from their real estate service providers. We generally develop performance measures to quantify the progress we make toward goals and objectives that we have mutually determined. Depending on client needs, our Integrated Facility Management Services units, either alone or partnering with other business units to benefit from their particular expertise or local market knowledge, provide services that include portfolio planning, property management, agency leasing, tenant representation, acquisition, finance, disposition, development management, energy and sustainability services, and land advisory services. We may provide services through our own employees or through contracts with third-party providers (as to which we may act in a principal capacity or which we may hire as an agent acting on behalf of our clients). 

Our Integrated Facility Management Services units are compensated on the basis of negotiated fees that we typically structure to include a base fee and a performance bonus. We generally base performance bonus compensation on a quantitative evaluation of progress toward performance measures and regularly scheduled client satisfaction surveys. Integrated Facility Management Services agreements are typically three to five years in duration, although most contracts are terminable at will by the client upon a short notice period, usually 30 to 60 days, as is typical in the industry. 

We also provide Lease Administration and Auditing Services , helping clients centralize their lease management processes. Whether clients have a small number of leases or a global portfolio, we assist them by reducing costs associated with incorrect lease charges, right-sizing their portfolios through lease options, identifying underutilized assets and ensuring regulatory compliance to mitigate risk. 

In the United States, the United Kingdom and selected other countries, we provide Mobile Engineering Services &#32;to clients with large portfolios of sites or where we have multiple clients in proximity to each other. Rather than using multiple vendors to perform facility services, these companies hire JLL to provide HVAC, electrical and plumbing services, and general interior repair and maintenance. Our multi-disciplined mobile engineers serve numerous clients in a specified geographic area, performing multiple tasks in a single visit and taking ownership of the operational success of the sites they service. This service delivery model reduces clients' operating costs by bundling on-site services, leveraging resources across multiple accounts and reducing travel time between sites. 

3. Project and Development Services 

Project and Development Services &#32;provides a variety of services to tenants of leased space, owners in self-occupied buildings, and owners of real estate investments. These include conversion management, move management, construction management, and strategic occupancy planning services. Project and Development Services frequently manages relocation and build-out initiatives for clients of our Property Management Services, Integrated Facility Management Services, and Tenant Representation Services units. Project and Development Services also manages all aspects of development and renovation of commercial projects for our clients, serving as a general contractor in some cases. Additionally, we provide these services to public-sector clients, particularly to military and government entities and educational institutions, primarily in the United States, and to a limited but growing extent in other countries. 

Our Project and Development Services business is generally compensated on the basis of negotiated fees. Client contracts are typically multi-year in duration and may govern a number of discrete projects, with individual projects being completed in less than one year. 

In a growing number of countries, we provide fit-out and refurbishment services on a principal basis under the Tetris brand, which is an outgrowth of a previous acquisition we completed through our French business. 

4. Capital Markets and Hotels 

Capital Markets and Hotels Services &#32;includes property sales and acquisitions, real estate financings, private equity placements, portfolio advisory activities and corporate finance advice and execution. We provide these services with respect to substantially all types of properties. In the United States, we operate a multifamily lending and commercial loan servicing platform and for a number of years we have been a Freddie Mac Program Plus&#174; Seller/Servicer . With our acquisition of Oak Grove Capital in 2015, we have added Fannie Mae and HUD/GNMA multifamily lending services capabilities. Real Estate Investment Banking Services includes sourcing capital, both in the form of equity and debt, derivatives structuring, and other traditional investment banking services designed to assist investor and corporate clients in maximizing the value of their real estate. To meet client demands for marketing real estate assets internationally and investing outside of their home markets, our Capital Markets Services teams combine local market knowledge with our access to global capital sources to provide superior execution in raising capital for real estate transactions. By researching, developing, and introducing innovative new financial products and strategies, Capital Markets Services is also integral to the business development efforts of our other businesses. 

Clients typically compensate Capital Markets Services units on the basis of the value of transactions completed or securities placed. In certain circumstances, we receive retainer fees for portfolio advisory services. Real Estate Investment Banking fees are generally transaction-specific and conditioned upon the successful completion of the transaction. 

We also deliver specialized Capital Markets Services for hotel and hospitality assets and portfolios on a global basis, including investment sales, mergers and acquisitions, and financing. We provide services to assets that span the hospitality spectrum: luxury properties; resorts; select service and budget hotels; golf courses; theme parks; casinos; spas; and pubs. 

We provide Value Recovery Services to owners, investors and occupiers to help them analyze the impact of a possible financial downturn on their assets and identify solutions that allow them to respond decisively. In this area, we address the operational and occupancy needs of banks and insurance companies that are merging with or acquiring other institutions. We assist banks and insurance companies with challenged assets and liabilities on their balance sheets by providing valuations, asset management, loan servicing, and disposition services. We provide receivership services and special asset servicing capabilities to lenders, loan servicers, and financial institutions that need help managing defaulted real estate assets. In addition, we provide valuation, asset management, and disposition services to government entities to maximize the value of owned securities and assets acquired from failed financial institutions or from government relief programs. We also assist owners by identifying potentially distressed properties and the major occupiers who are facing challenges. 

5. Advisory, Consulting and Other Services 

Valuation Services provides clients with professional valuation services to help them determine market values for office, retail, industrial, and mixed-use properties. Such services may involve valuing a single property or a global portfolio of multiple property types. We conduct valuations, which typically involve commercial property, for a variety of purposes, including acquisitions, dispositions, debt and equity financings, mergers and acquisitions, securities offerings (including initial public offerings), and privatization initiatives. Clients include occupiers, investors, and financing sources from the public and private sectors. For the most part, our valuation specialists provide services outside of the United States. We usually negotiate compensation for valuation services based on the scale and complexity of each assignment, and our fees typically relate in part to the value of the underlying assets. 

Consulting Services delivers innovative, results-driven real estate solutions that align strategically and tactically with clients' business objectives. We provide clients with specialized, value-added real estate consulting services in such areas as mergers and acquisitions, occupier portfolio strategy, workplace solutions, location advisory, financial optimization strategies, organizational strategy, and Six Sigma process solutions. Our professionals focus on translating global best practices into local real estate solutions, creating optimal financial and operational results for our clients. 

We also provide Advisory Services for hotels, including hotel valuations and appraisals, acquisition advice, asset management, strategic planning, management contract negotiation, consulting, industry research and project and development services for asset types spanning the hospitality spectrum. 

We typically negotiate compensation for Consulting Services based on work plans developed for advisory services that vary based on the scope and complexity of projects. For transaction services, we generally base compensation on the value of transactions that close. 

We provide Energy and Sustainability Services to occupiers and investors to help them develop their corporate sustainability strategies, green their real estate portfolios, reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint, upgrade building performance by managing Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") construction or retrofits and provide sustainable building operations management. We have more than 1,500 energy and sustainability accredited professionals. In 2014 alone, we documented $47 million in estimated energy savings for our U.S. clients and reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 278,000 tons. Our sustainability teams worked on a total of 8,098 buildings in 2014. 

We generally negotiate compensation for Energy and Sustainability Services for each assignment based on shared savings or the scale and complexity of the project. 

LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT 

Our global real estate investment management business, operating under the brand name of LaSalle Investment Management, has three priorities: 

&#8226; 

Deliver superior investment performance; 

&#8226; 

Develop and execute investment strategies that meet the specific investment objectives of our clients; and 

&#8226; 

Deliver uniformly high levels of client service globally. 

We provide investment management services to institutional and retail investors, including high-net-worth individuals. We seek to establish and maintain relationships of trust with sophisticated investors who value our global platform and extensive local market knowledge. As of December 31, 2015, LaSalle managed $56.4 billion &#32;of private real estate assets, including debt and equity, and public real estate securities, making us one of the world's largest managers of institutional capital invested in real estate assets and securities. 

LaSalle provides clients with a broad range of real estate investment products and services in the private and public capital markets. We design these products and services to meet the differing strategic, asset allocation, risk/return and liquidity requirements of clients. The range of investment solutions includes private investments in multiple real estate property types including office, retail, industrial, health care and multifamily residential, as well as investments in debt. We act either through commingled investment funds or single client account relationships ("separate accounts"). We also offer indirect public investments, primarily in publicly traded real estate investment trusts ("REITs") and other real estate equities. 

The geographic distribution of LaSalle's assets under management is as follows ($ in billions): 

&#32; 

Separate Accounts 

$ 

32.4 

Commingled Funds 

11.2 

Public Securities 

12.8 

Total Assets under Management 

$ 

56.4 

We believe the success of our investment management business comes from our strong investment performance, industry-leading research capabilities, experienced investment professionals, innovative investment strategies, global presence and coordinated platform, local market knowledge, and strong client focus. We maintain an extensive real estate research and strategy department whose dedicated professionals monitor real estate and capital market conditions around the world to enhance current investment decisions and identify future opportunities. Research and strategy is integrated throughout the investment management process from portfolio strategy formulation to property acquisition through ongoing asset management and disposition. In addition to drawing on public sources for information, LaSalle's research department utilizes the extensive local presence of JLL professionals throughout the world to gather and share proprietary insight into local market conditions. 

The investment and capital origination activities of our investment management business have become increasingly global. We have invested in direct real estate assets in 18 countries around the globe, as well as in public real estate companies traded on all major stock exchanges. We expect that cross-border investment management activities, both fund raising and investing, will continue to grow. 

Private Investments in Real Estate Properties (Separate Accounts and Commingled Funds) 

In serving our investment management clients, LaSalle is responsible for the acquisition, financing, leasing, management, and divestiture of real estate investments across a broad range of real estate property types. LaSalle launched its first institutional investment fund in 1979 and currently has a series of commingled investment funds, including eight funds that invest in assets in the Americas, ten funds that invest in assets located in Europe and six funds that invest in assets in Asia Pacific. LaSalle also maintains separate account relationships with investors for whom we manage private real estate investments. 

LaSalle is the advisor to Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. ("JLL IPT"), a non-listed real estate investment trust launched in 2012 that gives suitable individual investors access to a growing portfolio of diversified commercial real estate investments. As of December 31, 2015, JLL IPT had $1.1 billion in assets under management. In 2015, JLL IPT raised over $400 million. 

As of December 31, 2015, LaSalle had approximately $43.6 billion in assets under management in commingled funds and separate accounts. 

Some investors prefer to partner with investment managers willing to co-invest their own funds to more closely align the interests of the investor and the investment manager. We believe that our ability to co-invest alongside the investments of our clients' funds will continue to be an important factor in maintaining and continually improving our competitive position. We believe our co-investment strategy strengthens our ability to raise capital for new real estate investments and real estate funds. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of $311.5 million &#32;of co-investments in real estate ventures, the majority of which are included in LaSalle's $56.4 billion &#32;of assets under management. 

We may engage in merchant banking activities in appropriate circumstances. These may involve making investments of the Firm's capital or providing loan capital to acquire properties in order to seed investment management funds before they are offered to clients. 

LaSalle conducts its operations with teams of professionals dedicated to achieving specific client objectives. Each investment team functions as an entrepreneurial group managing an investment's entire life cycle and is directly accountable for performance. Regional investment committees, whose members have specialized knowledge applicable to underlying investment strategies, oversee all separate accounts and funds and must approve all investment decisions. This proven approach builds trust and alignment with our clients' investment objectives. 

LaSalle is generally compensated for investment management services for private equity investments based on capital committed, invested and managed (known as advisory fees), with additional fees (known as incentive fees) tied to investment performance above benchmark levels. In some cases, LaSalle also receives fees tied to acquisitions. The terms of contracts vary with the form of investment vehicle involved and the type of service we provide. Our investment funds have various life spans, typically ranging between five and nine years, but in some cases they are open-ended. Separate account advisory agreements generally have specific terms with "at will" termination provisions, and include fee arrangements that are linked to the market value of the assets under management, plus in some cases incentive fees. 

Investments in Public Equity 

LaSalle also offers clients the ability to invest in separate accounts focused on public real estate equities. We invest the capital of these clients principally in publicly traded securities of real estate investment trusts and property companies. As of December 31, 2015, LaSalle had approximately $12.8 billion of assets under management in these types of investments. LaSalle is typically compensated by securities investment clients on the basis of the market value of assets under management. 

REVENUE SUMMARY 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated a total of $5.2 billion &#32;of fee revenue, meaning revenue net of gross contract costs for vendor and subcontract costs that are otherwise included in revenue and expense, from the following RES product categories and LaSalle: 

COMPETITION 

As the result of our significant growth over the last decade, and of our ability to take advantage of the significant consolidation that has taken place in our industry, we are now one of the three largest real estate services and investment management providers on a global basis. We believe that other providers of real estate services are significantly smaller in terms of revenue than the three largest providers. We believe that JLL's geographic reach, scope of services and scale of resources have become sufficient to provide substantially all of the services our clients need, wherever they need them. To most effectively serve and retain current clients, and win new clients, we strive to be the best firm in our industry. 

Although there has been, and we expect will continue to be, consolidation within our industry, the totality of real estate services constituting the industry remains very large, and as a whole the provision of these services remains highly diverse and fragmented. Accordingly, since we provide a broad range of commercial real estate and investment management services across many geographies, we face significant competition at international, regional, and local levels. Depending on the service, we also face competition from other real estate service providers, some of which may not traditionally be thought of as such, including institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms, technology firms, firms providing outsourcing services of various types (including technology or building products) and companies that self-provide their real estate services with in-house capabilities. While these competitors may be global firms that claim to have service competencies similar to ours, many are local or regional firms which, although substantially smaller in overall size, may be larger in a specific local or regional market. 

Consultancy practices typically do not have our implementation expertise or local market awareness. Investment banking and investment management competitors generally possess neither our local market knowledge nor our real estate service capabilities. Traditional real estate firms lack our financial expertise and operating consistency. Other global competitors, which we believe franchise at least some of their offices through separate owners, generally do not have the same level of business coordination or consistency of delivery that we can provide through our network of wholly-owned offices, directly-employed personnel, and integrated information technology, human resources, and financial systems. That network also permits us to promote a high level of governance, enterprise risk management, and integrity throughout the organization and to leverage our diverse and welcoming culture as a competitive advantage in developing clients, recruiting employees, and acquiring businesses. 

COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS 

We believe that the key value drivers we list below create several competitive differentiators. These form the basis of our market positioning, which starting in 2016 we are calling &#8220;The JLL Way,&#8221; as the firm of choice for sophisticated clients seeking an integrated financial and professional services firm specializing in real estate on a global basis. 

Client Relationship Management . We support our ability to deliver superior service to our clients through our ongoing investments in client relationship management and account management. Our goal is to provide each client with a single point of contact at our firm, an individual who is answerable to, and accountable for, all the activities we undertake for the client. We believe that we enhance superior client service through best practices in client relationship management, the practice of seeking and acting on regular client feedback, and recognizing each client's own specific definition of excellence. 

Our client-driven focus enables us to develop long-term relationships with real estate investors, occupiers, and developers. By developing these relationships, we are able to generate repeat business and create recurring revenue sources. In many cases, we establish strategic alliances with clients whose ongoing service needs mesh with our ability to deliver fully integrated real estate services across multiple business units and locations. We support our relationship focus with an employee compensation and evaluation system designed to reward client relationship building, teamwork, and quality performance, in addition to revenue development. 

Integrated Global Business Model . By combining a wide range of high-quality, complementary services and delivering them at consistently high service levels globally through wholly-owned offices with directly employed personnel, we develop and implement real estate strategies that meet the increasingly complex and far-reaching needs of our clients. We also believe that we have secured an established business presence in the world's principal real estate markets, with the result that we can grow revenue without a proportionate increase in infrastructure costs. With operations on six continents and over 280 corporate offices, we have in-depth knowledge of local and regional markets and can provide a full range of real estate services around the globe. This geographic coverage, combined with the ability and willingness of our people to communicate and connect with each other across a common global platform, positions us to serve the needs of our multinational clients and manage investment capital on a global basis. We anticipate that our cross-selling potential across geographies and product lines will continue to develop new revenue sources for multiple business units within JLL. 

We also anticipate that over time we will continue to expand our service offerings that are complementary or adjacent to our current offerings. An example would be providing services to multifamily residential real estate that complements our current services to commercial clients seeking to develop multi-use properties that encompass office, retail and residential space. 

Another example is that we have used our cross-border capabilities to expand the brokerage business, initially acquired from King Sturge in 2011, of high-end residential properties based in London and Dublin. 

Industry-Leading Research Capabilities . We invest in and rely on comprehensive top-down and bottom-up research to support and guide the development of real estate and investment strategy for our clients. With over 300 research professionals who gather data and cover market and economic conditions around the world, we are an authority on the economics of commercial real estate. Research also plays a key role in keeping colleagues throughout the organization attuned to important trends and changing conditions in world markets. We facilitate the dissemination of this information to colleagues through our company-wide intranet. We are also devising new approaches through technology, including the use of the Internet and social media techniques, to make our research, services and property offerings more readily available to our people and our clients. 

We believe that our investments in research, technology, people, and thought leadership position our Firm as a leading innovator in our industry. Our various research initiatives investigate emerging trends to help us anticipate future conditions and shape new services to benefit our clients. Professionals in our Consulting Services practice identify and respond to shifting market and business trends to address changing client needs and opportunities. LaSalle relies on our comprehensive understanding of global real estate and capital markets to develop new investment products and services tailored to the specific investment goals and risk/return objectives of our clients. We believe that our commitment to innovation and thought leadership in sustainability helps us secure and maintain profitable long-term relationships with the clients we target: the world's leading real estate owners, occupiers, investors, and developers. 

Delivery of innovative solutions and consistent worldwide service (including through applications of technology) . We believe that our globally-coordinated investments in research, technology, people, quality control, and innovation, combined with the fact that our offices are wholly-owned (rather than franchised), and our professionals are directly employed, enable us to develop, share, and continually evaluate best practices across our global organization. As a result, we are able to deliver the same consistently high levels of client service and operational excellence substantially wherever our clients' real estate investment and services needs exist. 

Based on our general industry knowledge and on specific client feedback, we believe we are recognized as an industry leader in technology and business intelligence. We possess the capability to provide sophisticated information technology systems on a global basis to serve our clients and support our employees. For example, FutureView ( sm ), our global portfolio optimization tool, allows corporate real estate teams with geographically diverse portfolios to identify potential rent savings by comparing their lease obligations to our firm's sophisticated local market forecasts. OneView by JLL ( sm ), our client extranet technology, provides clients with detailed and comprehensive insight into their portfolios, the markets in which they operate, and the services we provide to them. 

Connect ( sm ), our intranet technology, offers our employees easy access to the Firm's policies, news, and collective thinking regarding our experience, skills, and best practices. We also have implemented globally integrated systems for finance, human resources, and client relationship management, as well as securities management and trading systems for our investment management business. 

We expect that we will continue to seek and implement additional ways in which we can develop and deploy technology platforms, use the Internet and employ social media techniques as business tools that will proactively make our own services and the real estate properties we list on the Internet increasingly efficient and useful to our constituencies, and that will support our marketing and client development activities. 

Maximizing Values of Real Estate Portfolios . To maximize the values of our real estate investments, LaSalle capitalizes on its strategic research insights and local market knowledge to develop an integrated approach that leads to innovative solutions and value enhancement. Our global strategic perspective allows us to assess pricing trends for real estate and know which investors worldwide are investing actively. This gives us an advantageous perspective on implementing buying and selling strategies. 

During hold periods, our local market research allows us to assess the potential for cash flow enhancement in our clients' assets based on an informed opinion of rental-rate trends. When combined, these two perspectives provide us with an optimal view that leads to timely execution and translates into superior investment performance. 

Strong Brand and Reputation . Based on evidence provided by marketing surveys we have commissioned, the extensive coverage we receive in top-tier business publications, the major awards we receive in many categories of real estate, sustainability, and ethics, as well as our significant, long-standing client relationships, we believe that large corporations and institutional investors and occupiers of real estate recognize JLL's ability to create value reliably in changing market conditions. Our reputation is based on our deep industry knowledge, excellence in service delivery, integrity, and our global provision of high-quality, professional real estate, and investment management services. We believe that the combined strength of the JLL and LaSalle brands represent a significant advantage when we pursue new business opportunities and is also a major motivator for talented people to join us around the world. 

During 2014, we introduced the more formal use of the name "JLL," together with refreshed logos for both JLL and LaSalle, across our businesses. The JLL name, which is also our New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol, has been used informally for a number of years and will therefore be our primary trading name. Jones Lang LaSalle remains our legal name. Using the shorter JLL name facilitates its adaptation to different communication styles in different countries, languages, and channels, and especially to the use of digital and online channels for marketing and communications. 

We believe we hold the necessary trademarks worldwide with respect to the "Jones Lang LaSalle," "JLL" and "LaSalle Investment Management" names and the related logos, which we expect to continue to renew as necessary. We have obtained the right to use the top level domain names of each of ".jll" and ".lasalle" from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"). 

Financial Strength . We focus on maintaining financial performance metrics, particularly our leverage and interest coverage ratios, that allow us to maintain investment grade financial ratings. We believe that confidence in the financial strength of long-term service providers has become increasingly important to our clients and they are increasingly making financial strength an important criterion when they select real estate service providers. Accordingly, our ability to present a superior financial condition distinguishes us as we compete for business. 

We also believe that our broad geographic reach and the range of our global service offerings diversify the sources of our revenue, reducing the overall inherent volatility of operating a real estate services business. This creates an additional measure of financial stability relative to other firms with more limited service offerings or that are only local or regional and therefore must rely on the strength of fewer diverse markets and services. 

For a number of years, we have maintained investment grade ratings from S&#38;P and Moody's: our issuer and senior unsecured ratings as of December 31, 2015: BBB+ (stable outlook) from S&#38;P and Baa2 (positive outlook) from Moody&#8217;s. 

Our primary source of credit is our unsecured credit facility (the "Facility") provided by an international syndicate of banks, which as of December 31, 2015 had a maximum borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion &#32;and a maturity date of February 25, 2020. During 2012, both to diversify our sources of credit and take advantage of historically low interest rates, we issued $275 million of long-term senior notes with a ten-year maturity and a fixed interest rate of 4.4% per annum. 

Employee Engagement . As a business whose primary asset is the expertise and capabilities of its people, it is important to periodically measure and evaluate the level of our employee engagement, their performance enablement, as defined below, and the effectiveness of our managers. We conducted our most recent comprehensive survey during the fall of 2015. We used an outside provider to conduct the study and then assist us in evaluating the results and identifying opportunities for improvement. 

Using our outside provider's definitions: 

&#8226; 

Employee engagement means the extent to which employees are motivated to contribute to organizational success and are willing to apply discretionary effort to accomplishing tasks important to the achievement of organizational goals; 

&#8226; 

Performance enablement means the extent to which an organization is committed to high levels of customer service and relies upon continuous improvement practices to achieve superior organizational results; and 

&#8226; 

Manager effectiveness means the extent to which supervisors are leaders, capable of facilitating team performance through effectively managing both the tasks and responsibilities as well as facilitating teamwork and interpersonal relationships. 

Our results indicated that our people reported an overall higher level of engagement, performance enablement, and manager effectiveness than the global norms. In all cases, our top quartile of most engaged employees demonstrated significantly higher results than the top quartile of the global norms. Our Employee Engagement Index, which measures the percentage of survey respondents reporting high levels of engagement with the Firm and their work here reached 76%, an increase of 3% over 2012, the last time we did a full engagement survey. Virtually all of our scores increased over the 2012 results, in some cases significantly. 

While we were pleased with the results, we are developing and intend to implement various actions to address specific areas where the data continued to indicate room for improvement or possible concerns. For example, we believe there is a desire for a greater understanding in some units of the Firm for how compensation is determined. In any event, we believe that the quality of our people, and their commitment to our organization and to providing a high level of service to our clients, provides us with an important differentiator within the markets in which we operate. 

History of strong investment performance. Our LaSalle business has a history of delivering strong investment performance for clients who entrust them with investing their capital in real estate and real estate securities. 

Strong governance, enterprise risk management and integrity. Our overlapping and communicative senior management and Board of Directors structure promotes an environment of best practices in corporate governance and controls. We believe that these attributes allow us to infuse a culture of internal communication and connectivity throughout the organization that is unparalleled in our industry. 

Successful management of any organization's enterprise risks is critical to its long-term viability. We seek to promote, operate and continually improve a globally integrated enterprise risk management model that optimizes our overall risk/reward profile through the coordinated and sophisticated interaction of business and corporate staff functions. 

Related to our governance and enterprise risk management efforts, we believe in uncompromising integrity and the highest ethical conduct. We are proud of the global reputation we have earned and are determined to protect and enhance it. The integrity our brand represents is one of our most valuable assets and a strong differentiator for our company. We have been recognized for eight years in a row as one of the World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute and in 2015 we were listed as #20 on the roster of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States by CR Magazine. 

Sustainability leadership . In 2014, we employed over 220 professionals dedicated to sustainability services for our clients. Beyond this, we are increasingly integrating sustainability into our own operations as well as to the core real estate services we deliver across the Firm. An example is our sustainability experts in Project and Development Services who manage green building certifications and the creation of central sustainability roles to embed sustainability throughout the advice we give to clients and within our own operations. Another example is the efforts that LaSalle is making to solidify its leadership role in responsible investing and sustainable best practices with the assets it acquires and manages for clients. Our overall leadership in sustainability is evidenced by our significant thought leadership, technology, awards, and industry involvement. During 2015, we revisited our sustainability messaging and strategy. As a result of an internal consultation process, our sustainability leadership agenda will now be called Building a Better Tomorrow ( sm ). Implementation of the agenda, which we are beginning in 2016, includes four main areas: Clients, People, Workplaces and Communities. 

With sustainability as a key focus, we invest heavily in our research and thought leadership to guide our clients' real estate investment and occupation strategies. We continue to develop influential sustainability research that supports our clients and contributes to the wider industry. Our global publications serve as good examples of our progress, including the Global Sustainability Perspective, the Real Estate Sustainability Transparency Index, and the Green Blog. We also maintain partnerships with nearly 50 sustainability organizations and initiatives to further both our own and our clients' sustainability commitments. These include global efforts such as the World Green Building Council as well as numerous local green building councils. 

In December 2015, members of our senior management team joined world leaders and experts from the private and public sectors at the United Nations climate conference, known as &#8220;COP21,&#8221; held in Paris. As an organization, we support the Paris Agreement that resulted. Considering that buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy use, the real estate sector has a key role in helping make the transition to a low-carbon future. JLL understands it plays a significant role in making this vision a reality. 

In our Energy and Sustainability Services business, we have developed industry leading technology platforms designed to help our clients reduce their environmental footprint and energy costs: (1) OneView Energy and Sustainability Analytics help us manage an ever-increasing volume of sustainability data on behalf of our clients around the globe; (2) Portfolio Energy and Environmental Reporting System ("PEERS"), provides a web-based platform for ongoing energy and environmental measurement and reporting including carbon footprint assessment; (3) Environmental Sustainability Platform is a real-time metering and monitoring program that enables on-line, real-time monitoring of building energy consumption; and (4) IntelliCommand is a powerful platform that combines smart technology with building operations expertise and execution to provide 24/7 real-time remote monitoring and control of facilities. These platforms demonstrate our global expertise in the provision of technology solutions and advance our role in addressing such global challenges and opportunities as climate change and smart buildings. Using our proprietary sustainability platforms, we helped our clients measure and improve their environmental impact in approximately 160,000 buildings as of 2014. 

Our sustainability consulting services benefit a wide range of clients including, for example, Leasing clients who commission green leases, green interior design and green assessments of prospective buildings; Capital Markets and Investment Management clients who want green building valuation assessments; and Project and Development Services clients who request retrofits to existing buildings. 

Internally, we have undertaken a materiality assessment to identify the key impacts underlying the four focus areas of Building A Better Tomorrow ( sm ). Our most material environmental issues are energy reduction for ourselves and our clients; improving the energy efficiency of our buildings; and reducing the impact of our business travel activities. In terms of our social impact, our most material issues are the ethics and integrity of our business; the health, safety and well-being of our employees; and the impact of our supply chain. Addressing these areas not only reduces our negative impact, but it also provides business benefits through reduced operating costs, employee well-being and retention, and reduced supply chain risk. We provide additional information in our latest Global Sustainability Report on our website. 

INDUSTRY TRENDS 

Since 2010, commercial real estate markets have continued their broad recovery around the world, although at different speeds and different levels of strength, and with some disruptions in countries and regions that have had political or economic challenges such as Brazil, Russia, China, and the Middle East. As indicated by the Property Clocks ( sm ) published by JLL's research team and provided below, co mmercial values in most markets continued to rise through 2015, though at varying rates of growth. 

Global capital flows for investment sales by region, below, indicate that volumes have continued to expand since they reached their lowest levels in the wake of the recent global financial crisis. However, market dynamics reflect contrasting conditions between the capital markets and the leasing markets. The strong capital markets have been supported by globally low interest rates, which have been encouraged by the so-called "quantitative easing" by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank. 

On the other hand, the leasing markets have been flatter since corporations have remained financially cautious in terms of commitments to space expansions and have also been focused on space optimization as a means to control cost and improve productivity. 

We define market volumes for Leasing as gross absorption of office real estate space in square meters for the United States, Europe and selected markets in Asia Pacific. We define market volumes for Capital Markets as the U.S. dollar equivalent value of investment sales transactions globally in the office, retail, industrial, hotels, mixed-use and certain other asset classes (excluding entity-level transactions, development deals and multifamily residential investment), for individual property assets or portfolios of assets with a value above $5 million. Our research professionals aggregate this market volume information from a number of sources globally and make it publicly available through the quarterly publication of our Global Market Perspective reports. In assessing our market share performance, we compare our own Leasing and Capital Markets revenue performance to the market volume performance in a region or globally to determine whether we are growing faster than the overall market. 

Although the urbanization trend and continued low interest rates globally kept the real estate markets in many of the world&#8217;s largest cities strong, which has continued to benefit JLL, 2016 has begun with some important political and economic uncertainties. These include significant reductions in oil and commodity prices, the slowdown in the China economy, the hostilities in the Middle East and the immigration pressures on Europe that have resulted as well as the occurrence of random acts of terrorism in urban centers outside the Middle East, the lack of clarity around the potential results of the presidential election that will take place in November 2016 in the United States, and the significant downturn in global equity markets. Additionally, emerging technologies that are potentially disruptive and the risks from potential cyber-security events will remain important influencers and concerns for all business entities, particularly those like ours that are global in nature. 

Increasing Demand for Global Services and Globalization of Capital Flows . Many corporations have continued to pursue growth opportunities in international markets. Many are striving to control costs by outsourcing or off-shoring non-core business activities. Both trends have increased the demand for global real estate services, including facility management, tenant representation and leasing, and property and energy management services. We believe that these trends will favor real estate service providers with the capability to provide services - and consistently high service levels - in multiple markets around the world. The highly competitive marketplace for the services we provide has, however, continued to put negative pressure on fees within some of our service lines. 

Additionally, real estate capital flows have become ever more global, as more assets are marketed internationally and as more investors seek real estate investment opportunities beyond their own borders. This trend has created new opportunities for investment managers equipped to source and facilitate international real estate capital flows and execute cross-border real estate transactions. One example we have seen in particular is that high-end residential real estate in major mature markets such as London and New York has become a type of "reserve currency" for wealthy individuals from other countries who are seeking stability in their investment holdings. We expect this trend to continue should uncertainty increase within Russia, China, the Middle East and other countries and regions. 

Growth of Outsourcing . In recent years, outsourcing of professional real estate services has increased substantially, as corporations focused corporate resources on core competencies. Although some continue to unbundle and separate the sources of their real estate services, large users of commercial real estate services continue to demonstrate an overall preference for working with single-source service providers able to operate locally, regionally and globally. The ability to offer a full range of services on this scale requires significant infrastructure investment, including information technology applications and personnel training. Smaller regional and local real estate service firms, with limited resources, are less able to make such investments. In addition, public and other non-corporate users of real estate, including government agencies and health and educational institutions, have begun to outsource real estate activities as a means of reducing costs. As a result, we believe there continue to be significant growth opportunities for firms like ours that can provide integrated real estate services across many geographic markets and types of clients. 

. 

In 2015, our Corporate Solutions business has continued to expand its client base as follows: 

Alignment of Interests of Investors and Investment Managers . Institutional investors continue to allocate significant portions of their investment capital to real estate. Many investors have shown a desire to commit their capital to investment managers willing to co-invest their own capital in specific real estate investments or real estate funds. In addition, investors are increasingly requiring that fees paid to investment managers be more closely aligned with investment performance. As a result, we believe that investment managers with co-investment capital, such as LaSalle, will have an advantage in attracting real estate investment capital. In addition, co-investment may bring the opportunity to provide additional services related to the acquisition, financing, property management, leasing, and disposition of such investments. 

We expect institutional capital to continue to flow into real estate as interest rates remain at historically low levels. In the event that global equity markets decline significantly, a potential counterweight will be the so-called &#8220;denominator effect&#8221; where money managers will reduce their real estate investments in order to keep them from becoming too large proportionately. We are also seeing institutional investors consolidate their real estate portfolios, moving away from the spread of smaller managers assembled over the last cycle to larger managers such as LaSalle. 

Industry Consolidation and Other Trends . We believe that consolidation in our industry will continue as the larger, more financially and operationally stable companies gain market share and become increasingly capable of servicing the needs of global clients. We also believe that developed countries will be favored for new investment as the risk appetite of investors remains conservative. Additionally, selecting service providers with the best reputation for sustainability leadership, governance, enterprise risk management and ethics will become increasingly important. Operators and investors seeking efficiencies from developing their supply chains will want to avoid the significant potential costs and reputational issues associated with compliance missteps, such as violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or anti-money laundering regulations. 

EMPLOYEES 

With the help of aggressive goal setting and performance measurement systems and training, we attempt to instill in all our people the commitment to be the best in the industry. Our goal is to be the real estate advisor of choice for clients and the employer of choice in our industry. To achieve that, we intend to continue to promote human resources techniques that will attract, motivate and retain high quality employees. The following table details our respective headcount as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (rounded to the nearest hundred): 

&#160; 

2014 

Professional non-reimbursable employees 

28,800 

24,800 

Directly reimbursable employees 

32,700 

33,300 

Total employees 

61,500 

55,100 

The significant increase in the number of employees year-over-year largely results from our acquisitions and from new contracts in our property and facility management businesses. Reimbursable employees include our property and integrated facility management professionals and our building maintenance employees. The cost of these employees is generally reimbursable by our clients. Our employees are not members of any labor unions, with the exception of over 1,600 directly reimbursable property maintenance employees in the United States. Approximately 41,300 and 40,800 of our employees as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were based in countries other than the United States. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

We regard our technology and other intellectual property, including our brands, as a critical part of our business. 

We hold various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, have registered numerous trademarks, and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in the United States and in foreign countries. We own the rights to use the dot-jll (.jll) and dot-lasalle (.lasalle) top level domain names, which we acquired during 2015. 

Consistent with our belief that we are recognized as an industry leader in technology as discussed above, we currently have a patented process in the United States for a "System and Method for Evaluating Real Estate Financing Structures" that assists clients with determining the optimal financing structure for controlling their real estate assets, including, for example, whether a client should own a particular asset, lease the asset, or control the asset by means of some other financing structure. We also have a number of pending United States patent applications to further enable us to provide high levels of client service and operational excellence. Our products that have pending patent applications include HiRise ( sm ), an online marketplace for leasing space, Blackbird ( sm ), a geospatial intelligence tool, and CRC Website, a cities comparison tool. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. 

Although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the &#8220;JLL,&#8221; "Jones Lang LaSalle," &#8220;LaSalle,&#8221; and "LaSalle Investment Management" names, and our Design (Three Circles) mark that is also trademarked. Our trademark registrations have to be renewed every ten years. Based on our most recent trademark registrations, the JLL mark would expire in 2024, while the Jones Lang LaSalle name would expire in 2022 and the Design (Three Circles) mark would expire in 2021. Since our LaSalle and LaSalle Investment Management marks will expire in 2016, these trademark registrations will be renewed with an expected expiration of 2026. 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY AND RELATED MATTERS 

We are committed to the values of effective corporate governance, operating our business to the highest ethical standards and conducting ourselves in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We believe that these values promote the best long-term performance of the Company for the benefit of our shareholders, clients, staff and other constituencies. 

Corporate Governance . We believe our policies and practices reflect corporate governance initiatives that comply with: 

&#8226; 

The listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), on which our Common Stock is traded; 

&#8226; 

The corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes&#8209;Oxley Act of 2002, as currently in effect; 

&#8226; 

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations; 

&#8226; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as currently in effect; and 

&#8226; 

The General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland, where Jones Lang LaSalle is incorporated. 

Our Board of Directors regularly reviews corporate governance developments and modifies our By-Laws, Guidelines and Committee Charters accordingly. As a result, over the past years we have adopted the following corporate governance policies and approaches that are considered to be best practices in corporate governance: 

&#8226; 

Annual elections of all members of our Board of Directors; 

&#8226; 

Annual "say on pay" votes by shareholders with respect to executive compensation; 

&#8226; 

Right of shareholders owning 30% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock to call a special meeting of shareholders for any purpose; 

&#8226; 

Majority voting in Director elections; 

&#8226; 

Separation of Chairman and CEO roles, with the Chairman serving as Lead Independent Director; 

&#8226; 

Required approval by the Nominating and Governance Committee of any related-party transactions; 

&#8226; 

Executive session among the Non-Executive Directors at each in-person meeting; 

&#8226; 

Annual self-assessment by the Board of Directors and each of its Committees; and 

&#8226; 

Annual assessment by the Company's senior executive management of the operation of the Board of Directors. 

During 2015, we were recognized for excellence in global corporate governance by the India Institute of Directors and for gender diversity on our Board of Directors by the 2020 Women on Boards. 

Code of Business Ethics . The ethics principles that guide our operations globally are embodied in our Code of Business Ethics, which applies to all employees of the Company, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Global Controller and the members of our Board of Directors. The Code of Business Ethics is the cornerstone of our Ethics Everywhere Program, by which we establish, communicate and monitor the overall elements of our efforts. We are proud of, and are determined to protect and enhance, the global reputation we have established since, in a service business such as ours, the integrity that our brand represents is one of our most valuable assets. For a number of years we have applied for and received Ethics Inside&#8482; certification from NYSE Governance Services, a leading organization dedicated to best practices in ethics, compliance, corporate governance and citizenship. We believe it is the only available independent verification of a company's ethics program. In 2015, for the eighth consecutive year, we were also named to the Ethisphere Institute&#8217;s list of the World's Most Ethical Companies, and we were also placed as #20 on the list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by CR Magazine. 

We support the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investing and, given that our clients include a number of the major companies within the electronic industry, the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct. We are also a member of the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative sponsored by the World Economic Forum. 

Vendor Code of Conduct . JLL expects that each of its vendors, meaning any firm or individual providing a product or service to JLL or indirectly to our clients as a contractor or subcontractor, will share and embrace the letter and spirit of our commitment to integrity. While vendors are independent entities, their business practices may significantly reflect upon us, our reputation and our brand. Accordingly, we expect all vendors to adhere to the JLL Vendor Code of Conduct, which we publish in multiple languages on our website, www.jll.com. We continue to evaluate and implement new ways to monitor the quality and integrity of our supply chain, including developing means by which we can efficiently survey and compare responses about the ethical environment and riskiness of current and potential suppliers that we engage both for our own firm and on behalf of clients. 

Professional Standards Guide. Our guide to professional standards seeks to establish principles under which our people will perform services for clients. It is published on our website. 

Corporate Sustainability. We encourage and promote the principles of sustainability everywhere we operate, seeking to improve the communities and environment in which our people work and live. We design our corporate policies to reflect the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency, and we hold ourselves responsible for our social, environmental and economic performance. We seek to incorporate sustainability practices and principles into our client investments and asset management. These priorities guide the interactions we have with our shareholders, clients, employees, regulators, and vendors, as well as with all others with whom we come into contact. We pursue our vision to lead the transformation of the real estate industry by making a positive impact both in and beyond our business. 

We also work to foster an environment that values the richness of our differences and reflects the diverse world in which we live and work. By cultivating a dynamic mix of people and ideas, we enrich our Firm's performance, the communities in which we operate and the lives of our employees. We seek to recruit a diverse workforce, develop and promote exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds and embrace the varied experiences of all our employees. 

We have begun to launch globally new internal branding around our overall sustainability program called Building a Better Tomorrow ( sm ). 

Corporate Political Activities . Given the diversity of the Company's clients, shareholders, staff, and other constituencies, the general approach of the Company is to not take positions as an organization on social or political issues or on political campaigns. Accordingly, our use of corporate funds or other resources for political activities has been negligible. From time to time, the Company may comment on proposed legislation or regulations that directly affect our business interests and therefore the interests of our shareholders. We may also belong to industry trade associations that do become involved in attempts to influence legislation in the interests of the industry generally. 

Conflicts Minerals. Since we are not a manufacturer, nor do we contract to manufacture, we do not believe that we engage in the purchase or procurement of conflicts minerals, either for ourselves or our clients.
