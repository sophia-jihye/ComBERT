 ITEM 1. BUSINESS References herein to &#147;Blackstone Mortgage Trust,&#148; &#147;company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148; refer to Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 

Our Company 

Blackstone Mortgage Trust is a real estate finance company that originates and purchases senior loans collateralized by properties in North America and Europe. We are externally managed by BXMT Advisors L.L.C., or our Manager, a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P., or Blackstone, and are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol &#147;BXMT.&#148; Our principal executive offices are located at 345 Park Avenue, 42 nd Floor, New York, New York 10154. We were incorporated in Maryland in 1998, when we reorganized from a California common law business trust into a Maryland corporation. 

We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. We operate our business as one segment, which originates and acquires commercial mortgage loans and related investments. 

Our Manager 

We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, which is responsible for administering our business activities, day-to-day operations, and providing us the services of our executive management team, investment team, and appropriate support personnel. 

Our Manager is a part of Blackstone&#146;s alternative asset management business, which includes the management of investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, public debt and equity, non-investment grade credit, real assets, and secondary funds, all on a global basis. Through its different businesses, Blackstone had total assets under management of $336.4 billion as of December 31, 2015. 

In connection with the performance of its duties, our Manager benefits from the resources, relationships, and expertise of the 394 professionals in Blackstone&#146;s global real estate group, which is the largest private equity real estate manager in the world with $93.9 billion of investor capital under management as of December 31, 2015. Jonathan D. Gray, who is the global head of Blackstone&#146;s real estate group, is a member of the board of directors of Blackstone and is a member of our Manager&#146;s investment committee. 

Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies, or BREDS, was launched in 2008 within Blackstone&#146;s global real estate group, to pursue opportunities relating to debt and preferred equity investments globally, with a focus on North America and Europe. Michael B. Nash, the global chairman and co-founder of BREDS, serves as the executive chairman of our board of directors and is the chairman of our Manager&#146;s investment committee. In addition, Jonathan Pollack, the global head of BREDS, serves as one of our directors and is a member of our Manager&#146;s investment committee. As of December 31, 2015, 107 dedicated BREDS professionals, including 32 investment professionals based in London and other international locations, managed $10.7 billion of investor capital. 

Our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and other executive officers are senior Blackstone real estate professionals. None of our Manager, our executive officers, or other personnel supplied to us by our Manager is 

&#160;

obligated to dedicate any specific amount of time to our business. Our Manager is subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors and has only such functions and authority as our board of directors delegates to it. Pursuant to a management agreement between our Manager and us, or our Management Agreement, our Manager is entitled to receive a base management fee, an incentive fee, and expense reimbursements. See Notes 11 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 13 &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detail on the terms of the Management Agreement. 

Our Investment Strategy 

Our investment strategy is to originate loans and invest in debt and related instruments supported by institutional quality commercial real estate in attractive locations. Through our Manager, we draw on Blackstone&#146;s extensive real estate debt investment platform and its established sourcing, underwriting, and structuring capabilities in order to execute our investment strategy. In addition, we have access to Blackstone&#146;s extensive network and Blackstone&#146;s substantial real estate and other investment holdings, which provide our Manager access to market data on a scale not available to many competitors. While the majority of our capital will likely continue to be invested in North America and Europe, we expect to benefit from Blackstone&#146;s global real estate debt platform. 

We directly originate, co-originate, and acquire debt instruments in conjunction with acquisitions, refinancings, and recapitalizations of commercial real estate around the world. In the case of loans we acquire, we focus on performing loans that are supported by well-capitalized properties and portfolios. We believe that the scale and flexibility of our capital, as well as our Manager&#146;s and its affiliates&#146; relationships, enables us to target opportunities with strong sponsorship and invest in large loans or other debt that is collateralized by high-quality assets and portfolios. 

Our business is currently focused on originating or acquiring senior, floating rate mortgage loans that are secured by a first priority mortgage on commercial real estate assets primarily in the office, lodging, residential, retail, industrial, and healthcare sectors in North America and Europe. These investments may be in the form of whole loans or may also include pari passu participations within mortgage loans. Although originating senior, floating rate mortgage loans is our primary area of focus, we also originate and acquire fixed rate loans and subordinate loans, including subordinate mortgage interests and mezzanine loans. This focused lending strategy is designed both to provide attractive current income and protect investors&#146; capital. 

As market conditions evolve over time, we expect to adapt as appropriate. We believe our current investment strategy will produce significant opportunities to make investments with attractive risk-return profiles. However, to capitalize on the investment opportunities that may be present at various other points of an economic cycle, we may expand or change our investment strategy by targeting assets such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Subordinate mortgage loans: These are interests, often referred to as &#147;B Notes,&#148; in a junior portion of a mortgage loan. The interests are subordinated to the &#147;A Note&#148; or senior participation interest by virtue of a contractual arrangement. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mezzanine loans: These are loans (including pari passu participations in such loans) made to the owners of a mortgage borrower and secured by a pledge of equity interests in the mortgage borrower. These loans are structurally subordinate to any loan made directly to the mortgage borrower. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Preferred equity: These are investments subordinate to any mezzanine loan, but senior to the owners&#146; common equity. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Real estate securities: These are interests in real estate which may take the form of commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, or collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Note financings: These are loans secured by other mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, and mezzanine loans. 

&#160;

We believe that the diversification of the portfolio of assets that we originate, our ability to aggressively manage those assets, and the flexibility of our strategy positions us to generate attractive returns for our stockholders in a variety of market conditions over the long term. 

Loan Portfolio Acquisition 

During the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a portfolio of 77 loans from General Electric Capital Corporation, or GE, and certain of its affiliates and joint venture partnerships, for a total purchase price of $4.7 billion. The GE loan portfolio consisted of commercial mortgage loans secured by properties located in North America and Europe, and represented a significant expansion of our lending business. The acquisition was financed through borrowings of $4.0 billion under a secured debt agreement with Wells Fargo as well as a portion of the $1.0 billion of proceeds we received from our underwritten offerings of shares of class A common stock during the second quarter of 2015. 

Our Portfolio 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we originated or acquired $8.8 billion of loans, including loans financed with $1.3 billion of non-consolidated senior interests. Loan fundings during the year totaled $8.3 billion, including $1.1 billion of non-consolidated senior interests. The following table details the overall statistics of our current loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 ($ in thousands): 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Floating Rate &#160; &#160; Fixed Rate &#160; &#160; Total &#160; Number of loans

&#160; $ 7,064,279 &#160; &#160; $ 2,012,728 &#160; &#160; $ 9,077,007 &#160; Unfunded loan commitments (1) 

&#160; $ 696,276 &#160; &#160; $ 4,382 &#160; &#160; $ 700,658 &#160; Weighted-average cash coupon (2)(3)

&#160; &#160; 63.9 % &#160; &#160; 64.2 % &#160; &#160; 64.0 % &#160;

&#160; (1) Unfunded commitments will primarily be funded to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by the borrowers. These future commitments will expire over the next four years. 

&#160; &#160; (2) As of December 31, 2015, our floating rate loans were indexed to various benchmark rates, with 84% of floating rate loans indexed to USD LIBOR. In addition, $147.9 million of our floating rate loans earned interest based on floors that are above the applicable index, with an average floor of 1.80%, as of December 31, 2015. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, loan origination costs, purchase discounts, and accrual of both extension and exit fees. Coupon and all-in yield for the total portfolio assume applicable floating benchmark rate for weighted-average calculation. 

&#160; &#160; (3) Weighted-average cash coupon and all-in yield include subordinate loans, which are not comparable to other loans as they are reported net of related non-consolidated senior interests. Excluding subordinate loans, total weighted-average coupon is 4.65% and total weighted average yield is 4.98%. 

&#160; &#160; (4) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower, however our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2015, 64% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 36% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. 

&#160; &#160; (5) Based on LTV as of the dates loans were originated or acquired by us. 

&#160; &#160;

Our loan portfolio is diversified by collateral property type and geographic location, the majority of which are senior mortgages and similar credit quality loans. The following presents the geographic distribution and types of properties securing our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160;

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, see Item 7 &#150; &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; II. Loan Portfolio&#148; and &#150; &#147;VI. Loan Portfolio Details&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Financing Strategy 

In addition to raising capital through public offerings of our equity and debt securities, our financing strategy includes secured revolving repurchase facilities, asset-specific repurchase agreements, and the sale of senior loan participations. In addition to our current mix of financing sources, we may also access additional forms of financings including credit facilities, securitizations, resecuritizations, and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances by us or our subsidiaries. 

&#160;

Concurrently with our acquisition of the GE loan portfolio, we entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo to provide us with $4.2 billion of financing secured by the acquired portfolio. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into one new revolving repurchase facility agreement, increased the maximum facility size of five of our existing revolving repurchase facilities, and sold one senior loan participation providing an aggregate $1.8 billion of additional credit capacity. The following table details our outstanding financing arrangements as of December 31, 2015 ($ in thousands): 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; December 31, 2015 &#160; Secured debt agreements

&#160;

&#160; &#160; $ 7,843,008 &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

&#160; (1) These non-consolidated senior interests provide structural leverage for our net investments which are reflected in the form of mezzanine loans or other subordinate interests on our balance sheet and our results of operations. 

&#160; The amount of leverage we employ for particular assets will depend upon our Manager&#146;s assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility, and other risks of those assets and the financing counterparties, the availability of particular types of financing at the time, and the financial covenants under our credit facilities. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets will be at the discretion of our Manager and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders. We currently expect that our leverage will not exceed, on a debt to equity basis, a ratio of 4-to-1. We will endeavor to match the terms, currency, and indices of our assets and liabilities, including in certain instances through the use of derivatives. We will also seek to limit the risks associated with recourse borrowing. 

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may engage in hedging transactions that seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates or currencies and their effects on our cash flows. These hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate or currency swaps or cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate or currency agreements or similar financial instruments. 

Floating Rate Portfolio 

Generally, our business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease net income. As of December 31, 2015, 78% of our loans by principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining 22% of our loans by principal balance earned a fixed rate of interest, but are financed with liabilities that pay interest at floating rates, which resulted in a negative correlation to rising interest rates to the extent of our financing. In certain instances where we have financed fixed rate assets with floating rate liabilities, we have purchased interest rate caps to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on such liabilities. 

Investment Guidelines 

Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our Manager shall seek to invest our capital in a broad range of investments in, or relating to, public and/or private debt, non-controlling equity, loans and/or other interests (including &#147;mezzanine&#148; interests and/or options or derivatives) relating to real estate assets (including pools thereof), real estate companies, and/or real estate-related holdings; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; prior to the deployment of capital into investments, our Manager may cause our capital to be invested in any short-term investments in money market funds, bank accounts, overnight repurchase agreements with primary federal reserve bank dealers collateralized by direct U.S. government obligations and other instruments or investments reasonable determined by our Manager to be of high quality; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; not more than 25% of our equity, as defined in the Management Agreement with our Manager, will be invested in any individual investment without the approval of a majority of the investment risk management committee of our board of directors (it being understood, however, that for purposes of the foregoing concentration limit, in the case of any investment that is comprised (whether through a structured investment vehicle or other arrangement) of securities, instruments or assets of multiple portfolio issuers, such investment for purposes of the foregoing limitation shall be deemed to be multiple investments in such underlying securities, instruments and assets and not such particular vehicle, product or other arrangement in which they are aggregated); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; any investment in excess of $250.0 million shall require the approval of a majority of the investment risk management committee of our board of directors; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; no investment shall be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

These investment guidelines may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented or waived pursuant to the approval of a majority of our board of directors, which must include a majority of the independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. 

Competition 

We are engaged in a competitive business. In our lending and investing activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by Blackstone and its affiliates), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for lending and investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources, such as the U.S. Government, that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments and offer more attractive pricing or other terms than we would. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in assets we target may lead to decreasing yields, which may further limit our ability to generate targeted returns. 

In the face of this competition, we have access to our Manager&#146;s and Blackstone&#146;s professionals and their industry expertise and relationships, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. We believe these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Risks Related to Our Lending and Investment Activities.&#148; 

Employees 

We do not have any employees. We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement between our Manager and us. Our executive officers serve as officers of our Manager, and are employed by an affiliate of our Manager. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Our operations in North America and Europe are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by U.S. and other governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (i) regulate credit-granting activities; (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (iii) require disclosures to customers; (iv) govern secured transactions; and (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans. We intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

In our judgment, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. In recent years, legislators in the United States and in other countries have said that greater regulation of financial services firms is needed, particularly in areas such as risk management, leverage, and disclosure. While we expect that additional new regulations in these areas will be adopted in the future, it is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, or results of operations or prospects. 

Taxation of the Company 

We made an election to be taxed as a REIT, effective January 1, 2003, under the Internal Revenue Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal income tax not to apply to our earnings that we distribute. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we are subject to certain U.S. federal excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, and will not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four years. 

Furthermore, we have one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, which pay federal, state, and local income tax on their net taxable income. See Item 1A &#150; &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items&#148; for additional tax status information.
