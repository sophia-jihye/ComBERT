 Item 1. BUSINESS 

As of January 31, 2016 , MFRI, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries ("MFRI", "Company" or "Registrant"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in one &#32;reportable segment: Piping Systems. As described below, prior to January 29, 2016, the Company was also engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in the Filtration Products segment. The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. Years and balances described as 2015 and 2014 &#32;are the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. 

In January 2016, the Company took a series of actions designed to refocus its business portfolio and cost structure to enhance the Company&#8217;s overall performance. These actions included the sale of MFRI&#8217;s domestic and international filtration businesses, including TDC Filter Manufacturing, Inc., Nordic Air Filtration, A/S and related assets, and the planned sale of the domestic fabric filter business in Winchester, Virginia. The sales follow a competitive bidding process that MFRI initiated as part of this program. 

In addition to paying down debt, the sale of the filtration business will give the Company the opportunity to focus resources on new Piping Systems growth opportunities such as the recent acquisition of 100% ownership of Bayou Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd. ("BPPC"), which the Company believes creates a strong platform to diversify and expand Perma-Pipe Inc&#8217;s ("Perma-Pipe") business into new markets and geographies. &#32; 

In connection with its strategic repositioning, the Company: 

&#8226; 

On January 29, 2016, sold certain assets and liabilities of its TDC Filter business based in Bolingbrook, Illinois for approximately $11 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, to the Industrial Air division of CLARCOR, a NYSE-listed company based in Franklin, Tennessee. CLARCOR is a leading diversified marketer and manufacturer of mobile, industrial and environmental filtration products. As a part of this program, MFRI plans to sell the 100,000 square foot TDC manufacturing and office facility in Bolingbrook, Illinois. 

&#8226; 

On January 29, 2016, sold its Nordic Air Filtration, Denmark and Nordic Air Filtration, Middle East businesses, for approximately $11 million, on a debt/cash free basis, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, to Hengst Holding GmbH. Hengst is a leading specialist in filtration and filtration management and an international development partner and OEM supplier for all major automobile manufacturers. 

&#8226; 

Is reorganizing the Company&#8217;s corporate staff and reducing expenses to reflect its new strategic focus and structure. The restructuring is expected to yield annualized savings of approximately $1.2 million. 

&#32;1 

At January 31, 2016 , one customer accounted for 10.3% &#32;of the Company's net sales. At January 31, 2015 , one customer accounted for 17.2% &#32;of the Company's net sales. 

Two customers accounted for 46.4% &#32;of accounts receivable at January 31, 2016 , and one customer accounted for 37.4% &#32;of accounts receivable at January 31, 2015 . As of April 1, 2016, these customers have paid 40.4% &#32;of their receivables outstanding at January 31, 2016 .

Piping Systems 

Products and services. &#32;&#32;The Company engineers, designs, manufactures and sells specialty piping and leak detection and location systems. Piping Systems include (i) industrial and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (ii) insulated and jacketed district heating and cooling ("DHC") piping systems for efficient energy distribution to multiple locations from central energy plants, (iii) subsea oil and gas gathering flow and (iv) above ground long lines for oil and mineral transportation. The leak detection and location systems are sold with some of its piping systems and also on a stand-alone basis to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property. 

Piping Systems frequently engineers and custom fabricates to job site dimensions and incorporates provisions for thermal expansion due to varying temperatures. This custom fabrication helps to minimize the amount of field labor required by the installation contractor. Most of the piping systems are produced for underground installations and, therefore, require trenching, which is the responsibility of the general contractor, and done by unaffiliated installation contractors. 

The Piping Systems segment is based on large discrete projects, and domestic Piping Systems is seasonal. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&#38;A") - Piping Systems." 

&#32;2 

Recent developments. On December 31, 2015, MFRI entered into a purchase agreement with its joint venture partner Aegion Corporation to acquire 100% ownership of BPPC, a coating and insulation company in Camrose, Alberta, which acquisition closed on February 4, 2016. MFRI had owned a 49% interest in BPPC since 2009, when the joint venture was formed with Aegion to serve the oil and gas industry in Western Canada. 

The purchase price was approximately $9.6 million in cash and debt at closing and is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. 

Customers . The customer base is industrially and geographically diverse. In the United States of America ("U.S."), the Company employs national and regional sales managers who use and assist a network of independent manufacturers' representatives, none of whom sells products that are competitive with the Company's Piping Systems. The Company employs a direct sales force as well as an exclusive agent network for several countries in the Middle and Far East to market and sell products and services. 

Intellectual property. &#32;&#32;The Company owns several patents covering its piping and electronic leak detection systems. The patents are not material either individually or in the aggregate overall, because the Company believes sales would not be materially reduced if patent protection were not available. The Company owns numerous trademarks connected with its piping and leak detection systems including the following U.S. trademarks: Perma-Pipe&#174;, Chil-Gard&#174;, Double Quik&#174;, Escon-A&#174;, FluidWatch&#174;, Galva-Gard&#174;, Polytherm&#174;, Pal-AT&#174;, Stereo-Heat&#174;, LiquidWatch&#174;, PalCom&#174;, Xtru-therm&#174;, Auto-Therm&#174;, Pex-Gard&#174;, Multi-Therm&#174;, Ultra-Therm&#174;, Cryo-Gard&#174;, Sleeve-Gard&#174;, Electro-Gard&#174; and Sulphur-Therm&#8482;. The Company also owns a number of trademarks throughout the world. Some of the Company's more significant trademarks include: Auto-Therm&#174;, Cryo-Gard&#174;, Electro-Gard&#174;, Sleeve-Gard&#174;, Permalert&#174;, Pal-AT&#174;, Perma-Pipe&#174;, Polytherm&#174;, Ric-Wil&#174;, and Xtru-therm&#174;. 

Raw materials. &#32;&#32;Basic raw materials used in production are pipes and tubes made of carbon steel, alloy, copper, ductile iron, plastics and various chemicals such as polyols, isocyanate, urethane resin, polyethylene and fiberglass, mostly purchased in bulk quantities. The Company believes there are currently adequate supplies and sources of availability of these needed raw materials. 

The sensor cables used in the leak detection and location systems are manufactured to the Company's specifications by companies regularly engaged in manufacturing such cables. The Company owns patents for some of the features of its sensor cables. The Company assembles the monitoring component of the leak detection and location systems from components purchased from many sources. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;Piping Systems is highly competitive and believes its principal competition consists of between ten and twenty major competitors and more small competitors. The Company believes quality, service, a comprehensive product line and price are key competitive factors. The Company also believes it has a more comprehensive line for DHC than any competitor. Some competitors have greater financial resources and cost advantages as a result of manufacturing a limited range of products. 

Government regulation. &#32;&#32;The demand for the Company's leak detection and location systems and secondary containment piping systems, a small percentage of the total annual piping sales, is driven by federal and state environmental regulation with respect to hazardous waste. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires, in some cases, that the storage, handling and transportation of fluids through underground pipelines feature secondary containment and leak detection. The National Emission Standard for hydrocarbon airborne particulates requires reduction of airborne volatile organic compounds and fugitive emissions. Under this regulation, many major refineries are required to recover fugitive vapors and dispose of the recovered material in a process sewer system, which then becomes a hazardous secondary waste system that must be contained. Although there can be no assurances as to the ultimate effects of these governmental regulations, the Company believes such regulations may increase the demand for its Piping Systems products.

Filtration Products 

Products and services. &#32;&#32;Prior to January 29, 2016, the Company manufactured and sold a wide variety of filter elements for cartridge collectors and baghouse air filtration and particulate collection systems. The principal types of industrial air filtration and particulate collection systems in use are baghouses, cartridge collectors, electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers and mechanical collectors. This equipment is used to eliminate particulates from the air by passing particulate laden gases through fabric filters (filter bags) or pleated media filter elements, in the case of baghouses or cartridge collectors, between electrically charged collector plates, in the case of electrostatic precipitators and contact with liquid reagents (scrubbers). The Company manufactured filter elements in standard industry sizes, shapes and filtration media and to custom specifications, maintaining manufacturing standards for more than 10,000 styles of filter elements to suit substantially all industrial applications. Filter elements were manufactured from industrial yarn, fabric and paper purchased in bulk. Most filter elements were produced from cellulose, acrylic, fiberglass, polyester, aramid, laminated membranes, or polypropylene fibers. The Company also manufactured filter elements from more specialized materials, sometimes using special finishes. 

The Company marketed numerous filter related products and accessories used during the installation, operation and maintenance of cartridge collectors and baghouses, including wire cages used to support filter bags, spring assemblies for proper tensioning of filter bags and clamps and hanger assemblies for attaching filter elements. In addition, the Company marketed hardware items used in the operation and maintenance of cartridge collectors and baghouses. The Company also provided maintenance services, consisting primarily of air filtration system inspection and filter element replacement, using a network of independent contractors. The Company had particular expertise in supplying filter bags for use with electric arc furnaces in the steel industry. Over the past three years, Filtration Products supplied filter elements to more than 4,000 user locations. 

Customers. &#32;&#32;The customer base was industrially and geographically diverse. These products and services are used primarily by operators of utility and industrial coal-fired boilers, incinerators and cogeneration plants and by producers of metals, cement, chemicals and other industrial products. 

Filtration Products were marketed domestically under the names Midwesco Filter and TDC Filter Manufacturing. The Company marketed its U.S. manufactured Filtration Products internationally using domestically based sales resources to target major users in foreign countries. The Denmark filtration facility marketed pleated filter elements under the name Nordic Filtration throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, primarily to original equipment manufacturers. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had 998 &#32;employees, of whom 51% &#32;worked outside the U.S. 

International
