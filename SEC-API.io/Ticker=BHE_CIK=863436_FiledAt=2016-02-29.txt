General 

&#160; 

Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (Benchmark), a Texas corporation, began operations in 1979 and has become a worldwide provider of integrated manufacturing, design and engineering services and product life cycle solutions. In this Report, references to Benchmark, the Company or use of the words &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; include the subsidiaries of Benchmark unless otherwise noted. 

&#160; 

We provide our services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial equipment (including equipment for the aerospace and defense industries), telecommunication equipment, computers and related products for business enterprises, medical devices, and testing and instrumentation products. A substantial portion of our services are commonly referred to as electronics manufacturing services (EMS). 

&#160; 

We offer comprehensive and integrated design and manufacturing services and solutions&#8212;from initial product concept to volume production including direct order fulfillment and post-deployment services. Our operations comprise three principal areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Manufacturing and assembly operations , which include printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) and subsystem assembly, box build and systems integration. Systems integration is often building a finished assembly that includes PCBAs, complex subsystem assemblies, mechatronics, displays, optics, and other components. These final products may be configured to order and delivered directly to the end customer across all the industries we serve. 

&#183; &#160; Precision technology manufacturing , which complements our electronic manufacturing expertise by providing further vertical integration of critical mechanical components. These capabilities include precision machining, advanced metal joining, assembly and functional testing primarily for customers in the medical, aerospace, and test &#38; instrumentation markets (which include semiconductor capital equipment). 

&#183; &#160; Specialized engineering services and solutions , which includes product design for electronic systems, sub-systems, and components, printed circuit board layout, prototyping, automation and test development. We provide these services across all the industries we serve, but lead with engineering to manufacturing solutions primarily in regulated industries such as medical, complex industrials, aerospace and defense. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our core strength lies in our ability to provide concept-to-production solutions in support of our customers. Our global manufacturing presence increases our ability to respond to our customers&#8217; needs by providing accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production of high-quality products &#8211; especially for complex products with lower volume and higher mix in regulated markets. These capabilities enable us to build strong strategic relationships with our customers and to become an integral part of their operations. 

&#160; 

Our customers often face challenges in designing supply chains, planning demand, procuring materials and managing their inventories efficiently due to fluctuations in their customer demand, product design changes, short product life cycles and component price fluctuations. We employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and lean manufacturing principles to manage the procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost-effective manner so that, where possible, components arrive on a just-in-time, as-and-when-needed basis. We are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials and can capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts, obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply, and return excess components. Our agility and expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain enable us to help reduce our customers&#8217; cost of goods sold and inventory exposure. 

&#160; 

Our global operations include manufacturing facilities in seven countries. Benchmark&#8217;s worldwide manufacturing facilities include 1.4 million square feet in our domestic facilities in Alabama, Arizona, California, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Texas; and 2.3 million square feet in our international facilities in China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania and Thailand. 

&#160; 

We have enhanced our capabilities through acquisitions and through internal expansion: 

&#183; &#160; In November 2015, we acquired Secure Communication Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, Secure Technology or Secure) (the Secure Acquisition), a leading provider of customized high-performance electronics, sub-systems, and component solutions for mission critical applications in highly regulated industrial, aerospace and defense markets. 

&#183; &#160; In October 2013, we acquired the full-service EMS segment of CTS Corporation (the CTS Acquisition). The CTS Acquisition expanded our portfolio of customers in non-traditional and highly regulated markets and strengthened the depth and scope of our new product express capabilities on the West Coast. 

&#183; &#160; In June 2013, we acquired Suntron Corporation (the Suntron Acquisition) to better serve customers in the aerospace and defense industries. 

&#183; &#160; In 2011, we acquired facilities and other assets to expand our precision technology capabilities in Penang, Malaysia. This expansion added sheet metal and frames fabrication services and advanced metal joining and grinding services, along with complex mechanical assembly and machining services to our Asia service offerings to complement our full service offerings in the Americas. 

&#160; 

We believe our primary competitive advantages are our product design, manufacturing, engineering, testing and supply chain management capabilities provided by a highly skilled team of personnel. We continue to invest in our business to expand our skills and service offerings from direct customer inputs. We have a closed-loop feedback system in place to respond to customer ideas to enhance our future flexible design and manufacturing solutions in support of the full life cycle of their products. These solutions provide accelerated time-to-market, time-to-volume production, and reduced production costs. Working closely with our customers and responding promptly to their needs, we become an integral part of their go-to market planning. 

&#160; 

In addition, we believe that a strong focus on human capital through the talent we hire and retain is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. Through our employee survey process, we solicit and act upon feedback to improve our Company and better support our customers in the future. We have taken steps aimed at attracting the best leaders and are accelerating efforts to mentor and develop key leaders for the future. 

&#160; 

Our Industry 

&#160; 

Outsourcing enables OEMs to concentrate on their core strengths, such as research and development, branding, and marketing and sales. In an outsourcing model, OEMs also benefit from improved efficiencies and reduced production costs, reduced fixed capital investment requirements, improved inventory management, and access to global manufacturing. OEMs continue to turn to outsourcing for these manufacturing benefits in addition to reducing time-to-market and time-to-volume production through utilization of their EMS providers&#8217; product design and engineering services benefits. 

&#160; 

Beginning in the 1990s, the EMS industry changed rapidly as an increasing number of OEMs outsourced their manufacturing requirements. In recent years, the number of industries served by EMS providers and their market penetration in certain industries increased, and we believe further growth opportunities exist for EMS providers to penetrate the worldwide manufacturing markets. In 2008, the industry&#8217;s revenue declined as a result of significant cutbacks in customers&#8217; production requirements, consistent with overall global economic downturns. Beginning in 2015, the industry has again experienced revenue declines as customers in certain sectors have reduced their production requirements due to global economic uncertainty; however, OEMs have continued to seek the benefits of a product design and outsourced model. While not all industries we serve are experiencing outsourcing growth rates, we believe that under-penetrated outsourcing markets such as medical, industrials (including aerospace and defense), and test &#38; instrumentation will continue to increase outsourcing in the future. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to be the solutions provider of choice to leading OEMs that we perceive offer the greatest potential for profitable growth. To meet this goal, we have implemented the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Focus on More Complex Products for Customers in Higher-Value Markets. EMS providers serve a wide range of OEMs in different industries, such as consumer electronics, internet-focused businesses and information technology equipment. The product scope ranges from easy-to-assemble, low-cost, high-volume products targeted for the consumer market to complicated, state-of-the-art, mission-critical products. Higher volume manufacturing customers in the more traditional markets of computing and telecommunications often compete on price with short product life cycles and require less value-add from EMS providers. Lower-volume manufacturing customers in the medical, industrial, and test &#38; instrumentation markets are often in highly regulated industries where they are increasingly outsourcing higher value-added services to their EMS providers to meet stringent regulatory and time-to-market requirements. We choose to focus on customers in the traditional markets with more complex requirements and in the higher-value markets where outsourcing growth rates are increasing, product life cycles are longer, and there is a strong match between our capabilities and the needs of these customers. The ability to serve customers in both markets is important to our strategy. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Leverage Advanced Technology and Lead with Engineering Solutions. In addition to strengths in manufacturing complex high-density PCBAs, complex mechanical systems, and full systems integration, we offer customers specialized and tailored advanced design solutions. We provide this engineering expertise through our design capabilities in our design centers in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Leading with engineering is important in our strategy to increase sales to customers in our targeted higher-value markets. Through leveraging our advanced technology and engineering solutions, customers can focus on core branding and marketing initiatives while we focus on bringing their products to market efficiently and timely. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Maintain and Develop Close, Long-Term Relationships with Customers . Our strategy is to establish long-term relationships with leading OEMs in expanding industries by becoming an integral part of their concept-to-production and full product life cycle requirements. To accomplish this, we rely on our global and local management teams to respond with speed and flexibility to frequently changing customer design 

&#160; 

specifications and production requirements. We focus on caring for our customers and insuring that their needs are met and exceeded. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Deliver Complete High- and Low-Volume Manufacturing Solutions Globally . OEMs increasingly require a wide range of specialized design engineering and manufacturing services from EMS providers in order to reduce costs and accelerate their time-to-market and time-to-volume production. Building on our integrated engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we offer services from initial product design and test to final product assembly and distribution to OEM customers. Our precision machining and complex mechanical manufacturing, along with our systems integration assembly and direct order fulfillment services allow our customers to reduce product cost and risk of product obsolescence by reducing their total work-in-process and finished goods inventory. These services are available at many of our manufacturing locations. We continue to expand our global capabilities: 

&#160; 

- &#160; in 2009, we added precision machining assets and capabilities to provide precision machining, metal joining and complex electromechanical manufacturing services in Arizona, California and Mexico; 

- &#160; in 2011, we expanded our precision technologies capabilities in Penang, Malaysia. This expansion added sheet metal and frames fabrication services, advanced metal joining and grinding services, along with complex mechanical assembly and machining services to our Asia service offerings; 

- &#160; in 2013, we strengthened our capabilities to better serve the aerospace and defense industries and added depth and scope to our new product express capabilities on the West Coast; and 

- &#160; in 2015, we acquired Secure Technology, which designs and produces encrypted and ruggedized communication systems, avionics displays and military-grade components. 

&#160; 

These full service capabilities allow us to offer customers the flexibility to move quickly from design and initial product introduction to production and distribution. We offer our customers the opportunity to combine the benefits of low-cost manufacturing (for the portions of their products or systems that can benefit from the use of these geographic areas) with the benefits and capabilities of our higher complexity support in Asia, Europe and the Americas. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Continue to Seek Cost Savings and Operational Excellence. We seek to optimize all of our facilities to provide cost-efficient services for our customers. We have a global culture of continuous improvement, sharing best practices and implementing lean principles. We try to optimize the efficiencies of our operations in order to provide efficient solutions to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our capabilities have continued to grow through acquisitions and we will continue to selectively seek acquisition opportunities. In addition to expanding our global footprint, our acquisitions have enhanced our business in the following ways: 

&#160; 

- &#160; enhanced customer growth opportunities; 

- &#160; developed strategic relationships; 

- &#160; broadened service and solution offerings; 

- &#160; provided vertical solutions; 

- &#160; diversified into new market sectors; and 

- &#160; added experienced management teams. 

&#160; 

We believe that growth by selective acquisitions is critical for achieving the scale, flexibility and breadth of customer services required to remain competitive.

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Seasonality in our business has historically been driven by customer and product mix, particularly the industries that our customers serve. Although we have historically experienced higher sales during the fourth quarter, this pattern does not repeat itself every year. In addition, we typically experience our lowest sales volume in the first quarter of each year. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We maintain a network of suppliers of components and other materials used in our operations. We procure components when a purchase order or forecast is received from a customer and occasionally utilize components or other materials for which a supplier is the single source of supply. If any of these single-source suppliers were unable to provide these materials, a shortage of components could temporarily interrupt our operations and lower our profits until an alternate component could be identified and qualified for use. Although we experience component shortages and longer lead times for various components from time to time, we have generally been able to reduce the impact of component shortages by working with customers to reschedule deliveries, with suppliers to provide the needed components using just-in-time inventory programs, or by purchasing components at somewhat higher prices from distributors rather than directly from manufacturers. In addition, by developing long-term relationships with suppliers, we have been better able to minimize the effects of component shortages compared to manufacturers without such relationships. The goal of these procedures is to reduce our inventory risk. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

We had sales backlog of approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015, as compared to the 2014 year-end backlog of $1.6 billion. Backlog consists of purchase orders received, including, in some instances, forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts. Although we expect to fill substantially all of our year-end backlog during 2016, we do not currently have long-term agreements with all of our customers, and customer orders can be canceled, changed or delayed. The timely replacement of canceled, changed or delayed orders with orders from new customers cannot be assured, nor can there be any assurance that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services. Because of these factors, our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future financial results. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The services we provide are available from many independent sources as well as from the in-house manufacturing capabilities of current and potential customers. Our competitors include Celestica Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Plexus Corp and Sanmina Corporation, who may have substantially greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted markets are engineering solutions capabilities, product quality, flexibility, cost 

&#160; 

and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, reliability in meeting product delivery schedules, pricing, technological sophistication and geographic location. 

&#160; 

In addition, original design manufacturers (ODMs) that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in traditional markets, such as computing and telecommunication. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets. 

&#160; 

Sustainability 

&#160; 

Benchmark is committed to being &#8220;sustainable&#8221;. Being sustainable describes our long-term approach to social, economic and environmental goals to contribute to a more sustained world consistent with our business objectives. Our sustainability priorities include: 

&#183; &#160; upholding the principle of human rights and observing fair labor practices within our organization and our supply chain; 

&#183; &#160; protecting the environment by conserving energy and natural resources and avoiding pollution through appropriate management technology and practices; 

&#183; &#160; ensuring ethical organizational governance; and 

&#183; &#160; observing fair, transparent and accountable operating practices. 

&#160; 

All Benchmark manufacturing facilities are either currently certified or undergoing certification to ISO 14001. Benchmark endorsed the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct and flows specific requirements to our supply chain through our contracts, Supplier Assurance Manual and Supplier Code of Conduct. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our operations, and the operations of businesses that we acquire, are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to security clearance, trade compliance, anticorruption, environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We seek to operate in compliance with all applicable requirements. Significant costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements, which could affect our earnings and competitive position. In addition, our past, current and future operations, and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns. 

&#160; 

We periodically generate and temporarily handle limited amounts of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law. We contract for the off-site disposal of these materials and have implemented a waste management program to address related regulatory issues. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 10,500 people, of whom approximately 500 were engaged in design and development engineering. None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by works councils. Some European countries also often have mandatory legal provisions regarding terms of employment, severance compensation and other conditions of employment that are more restrictive than U.S. laws. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we believe that our employee and labor relations are good. 

&#160; 

Segments and International Operations 

&#160; 

We have manufacturing facilities in the Americas, Asia and Europe to serve our customers. Benchmark is operated and managed geographically, and management evaluates performance and allocates resources on a geographic basis. We currently operate outside the United States in China, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania and Thailand. 

&#160; 

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, 5&#173;&#173;0%, 53% and 51%, respectively, of our sales were from our international operations. See Note 9 and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for segment and geographical information.
