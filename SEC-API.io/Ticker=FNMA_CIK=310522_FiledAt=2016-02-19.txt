 Item 1. Business &#32; 

INTRODUCTION 

Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;) that was chartered by Congress in 1938. We serve an essential role in the functioning of the U.S. housing market and are investing in improvements to the U.S. housing finance system. Our public mission is to support liquidity and stability in the secondary mortgage market, where existing mortgage-related assets are purchased and sold, and to increase the supply of affordable housing. Our charter does not permit us to originate loans or lend money directly to consumers in the primary mortgage market. 

Fannie Mae provides reliable, large-scale access to affordable mortgage credit and indirectly enables families to buy, refinance or rent homes. We securitize mortgage loans originated by lenders into Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities that we guarantee, which we refer to as Fannie Mae MBS. One of our key functions is to evaluate, price and manage the credit risk on the loans and securities that we guarantee. We also purchase mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, primarily for securitization and sale at a later date. We use the term &#8220;acquire&#8221; in this report to refer to both our securitizations and our purchases of mortgage-related assets. We obtain funds to support our business activities by issuing a variety of debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets, which attracts global capital to the United States housing market. 

We remain in conservatorship and our conservatorship has no specified termination date. We do not know when or how the conservatorship will terminate, what further changes to our business will be made during or following conservatorship, what form we will have and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated or whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. In addition, as a result of our agreements with Treasury and directives from our conservator, we are not permitted to retain our net worth (other than a limited amount that will decrease to zero by 2018), rebuild our capital position or pay dividends or other distributions to stockholders other than Treasury. Our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury also includes covenants that significantly restrict our business activities. Congress and the Obama Administration continue to consider options for reform of the housing finance system, including the GSEs. We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or final content of housing finance reform legislation or actions the Administration or FHFA may take with respect to housing finance reform. The conservatorship, the uncertainty of our future, limitations on executive and employee compensation, and negative publicity concerning the GSEs have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to retain and recruit well-qualified executives and other employees. We provide additional information on the conservatorship, the provisions of our agreements with Treasury, and their impact on our business under &#8220;Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We discuss the uncertainty of our future in &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Outlook&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We discuss proposals for housing finance reform that could materially affect our business in &#8220;Housing Finance Reform.&#8221; 

Although Treasury owns our senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 79.9% of our common stock, and has made a commitment under a senior preferred stock purchase agreement to provide us with funds to maintain a positive net worth under specified conditions, the U.S. government does not guarantee our securities or other obligations. 

Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;FNMA.&#8221; Our debt securities are actively traded in the over-the-counter market. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Please read this Executive Summary together with our MD&#38;A and our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Overview 

We reported net income of $11.0 billion &#32;in 2015, compared with net income of $14.2 billion &#32;in 2014. See &#8220;Summary of Our Financial Performance&#8221; below for an overview of our 2015 financial performance. We expect to remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future; however, certain factors, such as changes in interest rates or home prices, could result in significant volatility in our financial results from quarter to quarter or year to year. For more information regarding our expectations for our future financial performance, see &#8220;Outlook&#8212;Financial Results&#8221; and &#8220;Outlook&#8212;Revenues&#8221; below. 

With our expected March 2016 dividend payment to Treasury, we will have paid a total of $147.6 billion &#32;in dividends to Treasury on our senior preferred stock. The aggregate amount of draws we have received from Treasury to date under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement is $116.1 billion . Under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, dividend payments do not offset prior Treasury draws. See &#8220;Treasury Draws and Dividend Payments&#8221; and &#8220;Outlook&#8212;Dividend Obligations to Treasury&#8221; below for more information regarding our dividend payments to Treasury. 

Our Strategy and Business Objectives 

Our vision is to be America&#8217;s most valued housing partner and to provide liquidity, access to credit and affordability in all U.S. housing markets at all times, while effectively managing and reducing risk to our business, taxpayers and the housing finance system. In support of this vision, we are focused on: 

&#8226; 

advancing a sustainable and reliable business model that reduces risk to the housing finance system and taxpayers; 

&#8226; 

providing reliable, large-scale access to affordable mortgage credit for qualified borrowers and helping struggling homeowners; and 

&#8226; 

serving customer needs and improving our business efficiency. 

Advancing a sustainable and reliable business model that reduces risk to the housing finance system and taxpayers 

We have significantly changed our business model since we entered conservatorship in 2008 and our business continues to evolve. We have strengthened our underwriting and eligibility standards, we are moving from a portfolio-focused business to a guaranty-focused business and we are transferring an increasing portion of the credit risk on our guaranty book of business. These changes are transforming our business model and reducing certain risks of our business as compared with our business prior to entering conservatorship. 

Stronger Underwriting and Eligibility Standards. Beginning in 2008, we made changes to strengthen our underwriting and eligibility standards that have improved the credit quality of our single-family guaranty book of business and contributed to improvement in our credit performance. See &#8220;Single-Family Guaranty Book of Business&#8221; below for information on the credit performance of the mortgage loans in our single-family guaranty book of business and on our recent single-family acquisitions. 

Moving from a portfolio-focused business to a guaranty-focused business. In recent years, an increasing portion of our net interest income has been derived from the guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS, rather than from interest income on our retained mortgage portfolio assets. This shift has been driven by both the impact of guaranty fee increases implemented in 2012 and the reduction of our retained mortgage portfolio in accordance with the requirements of our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury and direction from FHFA. Our &#8220;retained mortgage portfolio&#8221; refers to the mortgage-related assets we own (which excludes the portion of assets held by consolidated MBS trusts that back mortgage-related securities owned by third parties). In 2015, approximately two-thirds of our net interest income was derived from our guaranty business. As described in more detail in &#8220;Outlook&#8212;Revenues&#8221; below, we expect that guaranty fees will continue to account for an increasing portion of our net interest income. 

Transferring a portion of the mortgage credit risk on our single-family book of business. &#32;In late 2013, we began entering into credit risk transfer transactions with the goal of transferring, to the extent economically sensible, a portion of the mortgage credit risk on some of the recently-acquired loans in our single-family book of business in order to reduce the economic risk to us and to taxpayers of future borrower defaults. Through 2015, we had transferred a significant portion of the mortgage credit risk on over $500 billion &#32;in unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans pursuant to these transactions. We intend to continue to engage in credit risk transfer transactions on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions. Over time, we expect that a larger portion of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business will be covered by credit risk transfer transactions. See &#8220;Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System&#8221; below for a discussion of our credit risk transfer transactions. 

Our business also continues to evolve as a result of our many other efforts to build a safer and sustainable housing finance system and to pursue the strategic goals identified by our conservator. See &#8220;Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System&#8221; for a discussion of these efforts and FHFA&#8217;s strategic goals for our conservatorship. 

Providing reliable, large-scale access to affordable mortgage credit for qualified borrowers and helping struggling homeowners 

We continued to provide reliable, large-scale access to affordable mortgage credit to the U.S. housing market in 2015. We were a leading source of liquidity in the single-family and multifamily markets in 2015. We also continued to help struggling homeowners. In 2015, we provided approximately 122,000 &#32;loan workouts to help homeowners stay in their homes or otherwise avoid foreclosure. We discuss our activities to support the housing and mortgage markets in &#8220;Contributions to the Housing and Mortgage Markets&#8221; below. 

Serving customer needs and improving our business efficiency 

We continued our initiatives to better serve our customers&#8217; needs and improve our business efficiency in 2015. These initiatives include continuing to revise and clarify our representation and warranty framework, implementing innovative new and enhanced tools that deliver greater value and certainty to lenders, simplifying our business processes, and updating our infrastructure. We discuss these initiatives in &#8220;Serving Customer Needs and Improving Our Business Efficiency&#8221; below. 

Summary of Our Financial Performance 

Comprehensive Income 

We recognized comprehensive income of $10.6 billion &#32;in 2015 , consisting of net income of $11.0 billion , partially offset by other comprehensive loss of $326 million . In comparison, we recognized comprehensive income of $14.7 billion &#32;in 2014 , consisting of net income of $14.2 billion &#32;and other comprehensive income of $530 million . The decrease in 2015 comprehensive income was primarily driven by a shift from credit-related income in 2014 to credit-related expense in 2015 and a decrease in fee and other income, partially offset by lower fair value losses. 

We recognized credit-related expense of $834 million &#32;in 2015 compared with credit-related income of $3.8 billion &#32;in 2014. This shift was primarily driven by a lower benefit for credit losses and higher foreclosed property expense in 2015. The reduction in our benefit for credit losses in 2015 as compared with 2014 was primarily driven by decreases in mortgage interest rates in 2014, which decreased the impairment on our individually impaired loans related to concessions provided on our modified loans and resulted in an increase in our benefit for credit losses in 2014. Changes in interest rates were not a primary driver of our 2015 benefit for credit losses. In addition, although home prices increased in both 2014 and 2015, home price increases had a smaller impact on our benefit for credit losses in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily due to the smaller number of nonperforming loans held for investment in our guaranty book of business in 2015 as compared with 2014. Also contributing to our lower benefit for credit losses in 2015 was our redesignation of certain nonperforming single-family loans from held for investment (&#8220;HFI&#8221;) to held for sale (&#8220;HFS&#8221;) in connection with our plans to sell these loans. 

We recognized fee and other income of $1.3 billion &#32;in 2015 and $5.9 billion &#32;in 2014. Our fee and other income was lower in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher revenue recognized in 2014 as a result of settlement agreements resolving certain lawsuits relating to private-label mortgage-related securities (&#8220;PLS&#8221;) sold to us. 

Fair value losses of $1.8 billion &#32;in 2015 and $4.8 billion &#32;in 2014 were primarily driven by a decline in longer-term swap rates in 2015 and 2014. 

We expect volatility from period to period in our financial results from a number of factors, particularly changes in market conditions that result in fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings. These instruments include derivatives and certain securities. The estimated fair value of our derivatives and securities may fluctuate substantially from period to period because of changes in interest rates, the yield curve, mortgage and 

credit spreads, and implied volatility, as well as activity related to these financial instruments. We use derivatives to manage the interest rate risk exposure of our net portfolio, which consists of our retained mortgage portfolio, cash and other investments portfolio, and our outstanding debt of Fannie Mae. Some of these financial instruments in our net portfolio are not recorded at fair value in our consolidated financial statements, and as a result we may experience accounting gains or losses due to changes in interest rates or other market conditions that may not be indicative of the economic interest rate risk exposure of our net portfolio. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Market Risk Management, Including Interest Rate Risk Management&#8221; for more information. In addition, our credit-related income or expense can vary substantially from period to period based on factors such as changes in actual and expected home prices, borrower payment behavior, the types and volumes of our loss mitigation activities, the volumes of foreclosures completed, redesignations of loans from HFI to HFS, and fluctuations in mortgage interest rates. 

See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221; for more information on our results. 

Net Worth 

Our net worth increased to $4.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;from $3.7 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2014 &#32;primarily due to our comprehensive income of $10.6 billion &#32;during 2015 , partially offset by our payments to Treasury of $10.3 &#32;billion in senior preferred stock dividends. 

The dividend amount payable to Treasury on the senior preferred stock for each dividend period from January 1, 2013 through and including December 31, 2017 is the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount. The capital reserve amount was $ 1.8 billion &#32;for dividend periods in 2015 and further decreased to $ 1.2 billion &#32;for dividend periods in 2016. Our expected dividend payment of $2.9 billion &#32;for the first quarter of 2016 is calculated based on our net worth of $4.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;less the applicable capital reserve amount of $ 1.2 billion . 

Single-Family Guaranty Book of Business 

Credit Performance 

In 2015, we continued to acquire loans with strong credit profiles and to execute on our strategies for reducing credit losses, such as helping eligible Fannie Mae borrowers with high loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio loans refinance into more sustainable loans through the Administration&#8217;s Home Affordable Refinance Program &#174; &#32;(&#8220;HARP &#174; &#8221;), offering borrowers loan modifications that can significantly reduce their monthly payments, pursuing foreclosure alternatives and managing our real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;) inventory to appropriately manage costs and maximize sales proceeds. As we work to reduce credit losses, we also seek to assist struggling homeowners, help stabilize communities and support the housing market. 

Table 1 presents information about the credit performance of mortgage loans in our single-family guaranty book of business and our workouts. The term &#8220;workouts&#8221; refers to both home retention solutions (loan modifications and other solutions that enable a borrower to stay in his or her home) and foreclosure alternatives (short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure). The workout information in Table 1 does not reflect repayment plans and forbearances that have been initiated but not completed, nor does it reflect trial modifications that have not become permanent.

Our single-family guaranty book of business consists of (a) single-family mortgage loans of Fannie Mae, (b) single-family mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS, and (c) other credit enhancements that we provide on single-family mortgage assets, such as long-term standby commitments. It excludes non-Fannie Mae mortgage-related securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio for which we do not provide a guaranty. 

(2) &#160; 

Calculated based on the number of single-family conventional loans that are 90 days or more past due and loans that have been referred to foreclosure but not yet foreclosed upon, divided by the number of loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business. 

(3) &#160; 

Includes acquisitions through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Also includes held for use properties, which are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of &#8220;Other assets.&#8221;

As discussed in &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8212;Credit-Related Income (Expense)&#8212;Credit Loss Performance Metrics,&#8221; our credit losses in 2015 included charge-offs of (1) $1.8 billion &#32;in loans held for investment and $724 million &#32;in preforeclosure property taxes and insurance receivable that we recognized on January 1, 2015 upon our adoption of FHFA&#8217;s Advisory Bulletin AB 2012-02, &#8220;Framework for Adversely Classifying Loans, Other Real Estate Owned, and Other Assets and Listing Assets for Special Mention&#8221; (the &#8220;Advisory Bulletin&#8221;) and (2) $1.1 billion &#32;in accrued interest receivable that we recognized on January 1, 2015 upon our adoption of a change in accounting policy related to loans placed on nonaccrual status. See &#8220;Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; for additional information. 

(6) &#160; 

Calculated as the amount of sale proceeds received on disposition of REO properties during the respective periods, excluding those subject to repurchase requests made to our sellers or servicers, divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the related loans at the time of foreclosure. Net sales price represents the contract sales price less selling costs for the property and other charges paid by the seller at closing. 

(7) &#160; 

Calculated as the amount of sale proceeds received on properties sold in short sale transactions during the respective periods divided by the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the related loans.

See &#8220; Table 38 : Statistics on Single-Family Loan Workouts&#8221; in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8212;Problem Loan Management&#8212;Loan Workout Metrics&#8221; for additional information on our various types of loan workouts. 

(9) &#160; 

Calculated based on problem loan workouts during the period as a percentage of the average balance of delinquent loans in our single-family guaranty book of business. 

Beginning in 2008, we took actions to significantly strengthen our underwriting and eligibility standards to promote sustainable homeownership and stability in the housing market. These actions have improved the credit quality of our book of business and contributed to improvement in our credit performance. For information on the credit risk profile of our single-family guaranty book of business, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,&#8221; including &#8220; Table 34 : Risk Characteristics of Single-Family Conventional Business Volume and Guaranty Book of Business .&#8221; 

Our single-family serious delinquency rate has decreased each quarter since the first quarter of 2010, and was 1.55% &#32;as of December 31, 2015, compared with 1.89% &#32;as of December 31, 2014. We continue to experience disproportionately higher serious delinquency rates and credit losses from single-family loans originated in 2005 through 2008 than from loans originated in other years. Single-family loans originated in 2005 through 2008 constituted 10 % of our single-family book of business as of December 31, 2015, but constituted 57 % of our seriously delinquent single-family loans as of December 31, 2015 and drove 78% &#32;of our 2015 single-family credit losses. For information on the credit performance of our single-family book of business based on loan vintage, see &#8220; Table 15 : Credit Loss Concentration Analysis&#8221; in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8212;Credit-Related Income (Expense)&#8212;Credit Loss Performance Metrics&#8221; and &#8220; Table 37 : Single-Family Conventional Seriously Delinquent Loan Concentration Analysis &#8221; in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management.&#8221; For information on certain credit characteristics of our single-family book of business based on the period in which we acquired the loans, see &#8220; Table 31 : Selected Credit Characteristics of Single-Family Conventional Guaranty Book of Business, by Acquisition Period &#8221; in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management.&#8221;

charged guaranty fee is calculated based on the average contractual fee rate, net of TCCA fee, for our single-family guaranty arrangements entered into during the period plus the recognition of any upfront cash payments ratably over an estimated average life, expressed in basis points. 

(2) &#160; 

Calculated based on unpaid principal balance of single-family loans for each category at time of acquisition. 

(3) &#160; 

The original LTV ratio generally is based on the original unpaid principal balance of the loan divided by the appraised property value reported to us at the time of acquisition of the loan. Excludes loans for which this information is not readily available. 

(4) &#160; 

We purchase loans with original LTV ratios above 80% as part of our mission to serve the primary mortgage market and provide liquidity to the housing finance system. Except as permitted under HARP, our charter generally requires primary mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement for loans that we acquire that have an LTV ratio over 80%. 

As shown in Table 2, our single-family average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions excluding TCCA fees has increased significantly since 2012. The primary driver of our higher single-family average charged guaranty fees on new acquisitions in 2013, 2014 and 2015, as compared with 2011 and 2012, was guaranty fee increases we implemented in 2012. The single-family average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions shown in Table 2 excludes the impact of a 10 basis point fee increase we implemented in 2012 pursuant to the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (the &#8220;TCCA&#8221;). This TCCA-related fee is unrelated to our pricing strategy, as the incremental revenue from this fee is remitted to Treasury and not retained by us. 

Other factors that impact our average charged guaranty fee on newly-acquired single-family loans are our loan level price adjustments and changes we make to our contractual fee rates. Loan level price adjustments refer to one-time cash fees that we charge at the time we acquire a loan based on its credit characteristics. Loans with higher LTV ratios or lower FICO credit scores generally result in higher loan level price adjustments than loans with lower LTV ratios or higher FICO credit scores. Accordingly, our average charged guaranty fee on new acquisitions varies from period to period based in part on changes in the types of loans we acquire during the periods. For example, our average charged guaranty fee on newly-acquired single-family loans would typically be lower during a period in which we purchased a high volume of non-HARP refinance loans than during a period in which we purchased a high volume of home purchase loans, as non-HARP refinance loans typically have lower LTV ratios than home purchase loans. The contractual fee rates we charge vary to the extent we make changes in our pricing strategy in response to the market and competitive environment. The decrease in our average charged guaranty fee on newly-acquired single-family loans in 2015 as compared with 2014 was driven by a decrease in loan level price adjustments charged on our acquisitions in 2015 and by changes we made in our contractual fee rates. 

The single-family loans we acquired in 2015 continued to have a strong credit profile, with a weighted average original LTV ratio of 75% &#32;and a weighted average FICO credit score of 748 . For more information on the credit risk profile of our single-family conventional loan acquisitions in 2015, 2014 and 2013, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8212; Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management,&#8221; including &#8220; Table 34 : Risk Characteristics of Single-Family Conventional Business Volume and Guaranty Book of Business&#8221; in that section. 

Whether the loans we acquire in the future will exhibit an overall credit profile and performance similar to our more recent acquisitions will depend on a number of factors, including: our future guaranty fee pricing and any impact of that pricing on the volume and mix of loans we acquire; our future eligibility standards and those of mortgage insurers, the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (&#8220;VA&#8221;); the percentage of loan originations representing refinancings; changes in interest rates; our future objectives and activities in support of those objectives, including actions we may take to reach additional underserved creditworthy borrowers; government policy; market and competitive conditions; and the volume and characteristics of HARP loans we acquire in the future. In addition, if our lender customers retain more of the higher-quality loans they originate, it could negatively affect the credit risk profile of our new single-family acquisitions. 

Beginning in September 2015, we implemented guaranty fee changes pursuant to a directive from FHFA. These fee changes included elimination of the 25 basis point adverse market delivery charge that had been assessed on all single-family mortgages purchased by us since 2008 and small, targeted increases in loan level price adjustments for loans with certain risk attributes. We do not expect these guaranty fee changes to result in material changes to our single-family guaranty fee revenue or loan volume. 

Providing Access to Credit Opportunities for Creditworthy Borrowers 

Pursuant to FHFA&#8217;s conservatorship scorecards and our statutory mission, we are continuing to work to increase access to mortgage credit for creditworthy borrowers, consistent with the full extent of our applicable credit requirements and risk management practices. As part of this effort, in 2014 we worked with FHFA to revise our eligibility criteria to address a specific segment of creditworthy borrowers&#8212;those who can afford a mortgage but who lack resources for a substantial down payment&#8212;in a responsible manner by taking into account factors that would compensate for the high LTV ratios of their loans. Specifically, we changed our eligibility requirements to increase our maximum LTV ratio from 95% to 97% for loans meeting certain criteria. In addition, in August 2015 we announced an improved affordable lending product, HomeReady TM , which is designed for creditworthy borrowers with lower and moderate incomes and provides expanded eligibility for financing homes in designated low-income, minority and disaster-impacted communities. Under our HomeReady guidelines, evidence of income from a non-borrower household member can be considered as a factor to allow a borrower to qualify with a higher debt-to-income ratio for the loan, helping multi-generational and extended households obtain homeownership. HomeReady also permits rental income, such as from a basement apartment, to augment the borrower&#8217;s qualifying income. We began acquiring loans under our revised eligibility criteria in December 2014 and under HomeReady in December 2015. 

Our eligibility requirements for loans acquired under our revised eligibility criteria and under HomeReady include compensating factors and risk mitigants, which reduce the incidence of loans with multiple higher-risk characteristics. Loans acquired under our revised eligibility criteria and under HomeReady with LTV ratios greater than 95% must be fixed-rate loans and must be underwritten through Desktop Underwriter &#174; , our proprietary automated underwriting system. Desktop Underwriter provides a comprehensive credit risk assessment on loan applications submitted through the system, assessing risks and compensating factors, and identifying loan applications that do not meet our eligibility requirements. HomeReady borrowers are required to complete an online education course preparing them for the home buying process and providing post-purchase support for sustainable homeownership. In addition, we require mortgage insurance or other appropriate credit enhancement for all acquisitions of non-HARP single-family conventional loans with LTV ratios greater than 80%. 

In 2015, pursuant to our revised eligibility criteria and HomeReady, we acquired approximately 24,000 &#32;single-family loans with 95.01% to 97% LTV ratios from approximately 700 &#32;lenders. These loans represented 1% &#32;of the single-family loans we acquired in 2015. While we expect the volume of loans we acquire with 95.01% to 97% LTV ratios under these criteria and HomeReady to increase, we expect they will continue to constitute only a small portion of our acquisitions. 

Although a higher LTV ratio may indicate that a loan presents a higher credit risk than a loan with a lower LTV ratio, we expect our acquisition of these loans under our revised eligibility criteria and under HomeReady will not materially affect our overall credit risk because we expect that (1) the eligibility requirements these loans must meet will limit their effect on our credit risk and (2) these loans will constitute a small portion of our acquisitions. In addition, we have experience managing the credit risk associated with loans with LTV ratios in this range. 

We continue to seek new ways to responsibly expand access to mortgage credit. FHFA&#8217;s 2016 conservatorship scorecard specifies that in 2016 we should continue to assess impediments to credit access and develop recommendations to address these barriers. 

To the extent we are able to encourage lenders to increase access to mortgage credit, we may acquire a greater number of single-family loans with higher risk characteristics than we acquired in recent periods; however, we expect our single-family acquisitions will continue to have a strong overall credit risk profile given our current underwriting and eligibility standards and product design. We actively monitor the credit risk profile and credit performance of our single-family loan acquisitions, in conjunction with housing market and economic conditions, to determine if our pricing, eligibility and underwriting criteria accurately reflect the risks associated with loans we acquire or guarantee. 

Contributions to the Housing and Mortgage Markets 

Liquidity and Support Activities 

As a leading provider of residential mortgage credit in the United States, we indirectly enable families to buy, refinance or rent homes. During 2015, we continued to provide critical liquidity and support to the U.S. mortgage market in a number of important ways: 

&#8226; 

We serve as a stable source of liquidity for purchases of homes and financing of multifamily rental housing, as well as for refinancing existing mortgages. We provided approximately $516 billion &#32;in liquidity to the mortgage market in 2015 through our purchases of loans and guarantees of loans and securities. This liquidity enabled borrowers to complete approximately 1,188,000 &#32;mortgage refinancings and approximately 954,000 &#32;home purchases, and provided financing for approximately 569,000 &#32;units of multifamily housing. 

&#8226; 

Our role in the market enables qualified borrowers to have reliable access to affordable mortgage credit, including a variety of conforming mortgage products such as the prepayable 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that protects homeowners from fluctuations in interest rates. 

&#8226; 

We provided approximately 122,000 &#32;loan workouts in 2015 to help homeowners stay in their homes or otherwise avoid foreclosure. Our loan workout efforts have helped to stabilize neighborhoods, home prices and the housing market. 

&#8226; 

We helped borrowers refinance loans, including through our Refi Plus initiative, which offers additional refinancing flexibility to eligible borrowers who are current on their loans, whose loans are owned or guaranteed by us and who meet certain additional criteria. We acquired approximately 198,000 &#32;Refi Plus loans in 2015. Refinancings delivered to us through Refi Plus in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced borrowers&#8217; monthly mortgage payments by an average of $191 . 

&#8226; 

We support affordability in the multifamily rental market. Over 90% &#32;of the multifamily units we financed in 2015 were affordable to families earning at or below 120% of the median income in their area, providing support for both workforce housing and affordable housing. 

&#8226; 

In addition to purchasing and guaranteeing loans, we provide funds to the mortgage market through short-term financing and other activities. These activities are described in &#8220;Business Segments&#8212;Capital Markets.&#8221; 

2015 &#32;Market Share 

We estimate that our single-family market share was 28% &#32;in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 . These amounts represent our single-family mortgage acquisitions for each year, excluding delinquent loans we purchased from our MBS trusts, as a percentage of the single-family first-lien mortgages we currently estimate were originated in the United States that year. Our estimate of mortgage originations in prior periods is subject to change as additional data become available; therefore, these market share estimates may change in the future, perhaps materially. 

We were one of the largest issuers of mortgage-related securities in the secondary market in 2015 , with an estimated market share of new single-family mortgage-related securities issuances of 37% , compared with 40% &#32;for 2014 . We estimate our market share of new single-family mortgage-related securities issuances was 36% &#32;in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2015 , compared with 40% &#32;in the fourth quarter of 2014 . Our market share for new single-family mortgage-related securities issuances decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily as a result of competition from Ginnie Mae. 

We remained a continuous source of liquidity in the multifamily market in 2015 . We owned or guaranteed approximately 19% &#32;of the outstanding debt on multifamily properties as of September 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information is available). 

Serving Customer Needs and Improving Our Business Efficiency 

We are undertaking various initiatives to better serve our customers&#8217; needs and improve our business efficiency. We are committed to providing our lender partners with the products, services and tools they need to serve the market more effectively and efficiently. To further this commitment, we are focused on continuing to revise and clarify our representation and warranty framework, implementing innovative new and enhanced tools that deliver greater value and certainty to lenders, and making our customers&#8217; interactions with us simpler and more efficient. 

We have taken several actions in recent years to improve our representation and warranty framework and help lenders reduce their repurchase risk relating to loans they deliver to us, including: 

&#8226; 

Revising our representation and warranty framework in 2013 to limit our ability to require lenders to repurchase loans for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, effective for loans delivered on or after January 1, 2013 that have had 36 timely payments (or 12 timely payments for Refi Plus loans) and meet other eligibility requirements. We further revised our representation and warranty framework in 2014 to relax the timely payment requirement effective for conventional loans delivered on or after July 1, 2014 to permit two instances of 30-day delinquency, and to allow loans to qualify for relief after satisfactory conclusion of a quality control review. 

&#8226; 

Providing lenders with greater clarity on the circumstances that would result in a loan repurchase request. For example, in November 2014, we issued a lender announcement updating and clarifying aspects of our new representation and warranty framework, particularly relating to the &#8220;life of loan&#8221; representations and warranties that are not eligible for repurchase relief. 

&#8226; 

Expediting our review of newly acquired performing loans to identify loan defects earlier. 

&#8226; 

Offering lenders new or enhanced innovative tools to help them ensure the quality of the loans they deliver to us, such as our EarlyCheck TM loan verification tool, which enables early validation of loan delivery eligibility, allowing lenders to make corrections and avoid the delivery of ineligible loans. 

&#8226; 

Providing lenders with training and feedback to help them resolve origination issues and reduce loan origination defects. 

&#8226; 

Offering lenders alternatives to repurchasing loans in the event of underwriting defects, including the right to correct loan defects and to propose alternative remedies for our consideration. We also provided lenders specific guidance in October 2015 on what types of loan defects could lead to a repurchase request or an alternative remedy. 

&#8226; 

Announcing in February 2016 a new independent dispute resolution process to resolve disagreements over repurchase requests in a timely fashion when needed. This independent dispute resolution process will be available for loans delivered on and after January 1, 2016. 

These actions have significantly reduced uncertainty surrounding lenders&#8217; repurchase risk relating to loans they deliver to us, and our intention is that these actions will encourage lenders to safely expand their lending to a wider range of qualified borrowers. As of December 31, 2015, more than one million &#32;loans in our book of business had obtained relief from repurchases for breaches of certain representations and warranties. We continue to work on new ways to reduce or clarify lenders&#8217; repurchase risk. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8221; for further discussion of changes to our representation and warranty framework and actions we have taken to reduce and clarify lenders&#8217; repurchase risk. 

In 2015, we implemented a number of changes designed to help our customers originate mortgages with increased certainty, efficiency and lower costs, including the following: 

&#8226; 

In January 2015, we made Collateral Underwriter &#174; &#32;available to lenders at no cost, giving them access to the same appraisal review tool we use so that they can address potential appraisal issues prior to delivering a loan to us. 

&#8226; 

In April 2015, we integrated Collateral Underwriter with our Desktop Underwriter underwriting system, which we believe will enhance our lenders&#8217; risk management and underwriting capabilities. 

&#8226; 

In June 2015, we eliminated fees charged to customers for using Desktop Underwriter and Desktop Originator &#174; , which we expect will allow more lenders to access these systems in their underwriting process. 

&#8226; 

In October 2015, we enhanced our EarlyCheck loan verification tool with additional loan-level data integrity capabilities, to give lenders confidence that the loans they deliver to us have accurate, complete data and meet our requirements. 

&#8226; 

In November 2015, we introduced Fannie Mae Connect TM , a new self-service portal for lenders to access the data and analytics they need through a one stop source that replaced multiple legacy systems. 

&#8226; 

In December 2015, we launched a new loan delivery platform for lenders that is designed to help lenders deliver loans more efficiently and with greater transparency and certainty. 

We continue to focus on improving our business to provide value to customers. For example, we expect to implement additional enhancements to Desktop Underwriter in 2016 to further help our lender customers originate mortgages with increased efficiency and lower costs and to help increase access to credit for creditworthy borrowers, such as incorporating trended credit data and offering third-party validation of specified borrower data. 

We are also working on a multi-year effort to improve our business efficiency and agility through simplification of our business processes and enhancements to our infrastructure. Many of these improvements are also designed to enhance our customers&#8217; experience when doing business with us, including making our customers&#8217; interactions with us simpler and more efficient. These efforts include replacing some of our systems with simpler, more automated infrastructure that will enable us to more efficiently process transactions and manage our book of business, as well as to better adapt to industry and regulatory changes in the future. We are also implementing infrastructure improvements to support the integration of our business with the common securitization platform and our ability to issue a single GSE security, which we describe below under &#8220;Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System.&#8221; 

Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System 

We continue to invest significant resources towards helping to build a safer and sustainable housing finance system, primarily through pursuing the strategic goals identified by our conservator. FHFA&#8217;s current strategic goals for our conservatorship are to: 

&#8226; 

Maintain , in a safe and sound manner, credit availability and foreclosure prevention activities for new and refinanced mortgages to foster liquid, efficient, competitive and resilient national housing finance markets. 

&#8226; 

Reduce &#32;taxpayer risk through increasing the role of private capital in the mortgage market. 

&#8226; 

Build a new single-family infrastructure for use by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and adaptable for use by other participants in the secondary market in the future. 

Since 2012, FHFA has released annual corporate performance objectives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, referred to as the conservatorship scorecard, which detail specific priorities for implementing FHFA&#8217;s strategic goals. FHFA released its 2015 conservatorship scorecard in January 2015, and its 2016 conservatorship scorecard in December 2015. Both FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives designed to further the goal of reforming the housing finance system. We describe below some of the actions we are taking pursuant to the mandates of the scorecards in order to build the policies and infrastructure for a sustainable housing finance system. 

Credit Risk Transfer Transactions. &#32;FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to credit risk transfer transactions. The goal of these transactions is, to the extent economically sensible, to transfer a portion of the existing mortgage credit risk on a portion of recently-acquired loans in our single-family guaranty book of business in order to reduce the economic risk to us and to taxpayers of future borrower defaults. Our primary method of achieving our scorecard objectives relating to credit risk transfer transactions has been through the issuance of our Connecticut Avenue Securities TM &#32;(&#8220;CAS&#8221;) and our Credit Insurance Risk Transfer TM &#32;(&#8220;CIRT TM &#8221;) transactions. These transactions transfer a portion of the mortgage credit risk associated with losses on specified reference pools of single-family mortgage loans to investors in CAS in the case of CAS transactions or to panels of reinsurers or insurers in the case of CIRT transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we had completed a total of nine CAS transactions since the CAS program began in 2013 and seven &#32;CIRT transactions since the CIRT program began in 2014. Approximately 15% &#32;of the loans in our single-family conventional guaranty book of business as of December 31, 2015, measured by unpaid principal balance, were included in a reference pool for a CAS or CIRT transaction. We have also executed other types of risk sharing transactions in addition to our CAS and CIRT transactions, including structures that transfer first loss risk. In the aggregate, our credit risk transfer transactions completed through year-end 2015 transferred a significant portion of the mortgage credit risk on single-family mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of over $500 billion . 

We have transferred a significant portion of the mortgage credit risk on over 95% &#32;of the single-family loans we acquired during the twelve months ended November 2014 that were in our targeted loan categories for our credit risk transfer transactions. Loan categories we have targeted for credit risk transfer transactions generally consist of fixed-rate 30-year single-family conventional loans that meet certain credit performance characteristics, are non-Refi Plus and have LTV ratios between 60% and 97%. Based on their characteristics at the time we acquired them, over 50% &#32;of the single-family loans we acquired during the twelve months ended November 2014 were included in loan categories we have targeted for credit risk transfer transactions. The portion of our single-family loan acquisitions we include in credit risk transfer transactions can vary from period to period based on market conditions and other factors. 

We intend to continue to engage in regular CAS and CIRT transactions on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8212;Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk&#8212;Credit Risk-Sharing Transactions&#8221; for more information on these transactions. 

Common Securitization Platform. &#32;FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to the development of a common securitization platform that is intended to replace certain elements of Fannie Mae&#8217;s and Freddie Mac&#8217;s respective proprietary systems for securitizing mortgages and performing associated back office and administrative functions. In October 2013, at the direction of our conservator, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established Common Securitization Solutions, LLC (&#8220;CSS&#8221;), a jointly owned limited liability company formed to design, develop, build and ultimately operate the platform. We continue to work with FHFA, Freddie Mac and CSS on building and testing the common securitization platform, as well as on implementing required changes to our systems and operations to integrate with the common securitization platform. In September 2015, FHFA issued &#8220;An Update on the Common Securitization Platform,&#8221; which provided details on the progress made in developing the platform. FHFA&#8217;s 2016 conservatorship scorecard states that FHFA expects both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to implement the single security on the common securitization platform in 2018. See &#8220;Housing Finance Reform&#8212;Conservator Developments&#8221; for more information on the progress of the common securitization platform initiative. 

Single Security. FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to the development of a single mortgage-backed security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In May 2015, FHFA published its initial determinations regarding the key features of the single security structure. During 2015, we, FHFA and Freddie Mac developed a plan to implement the single security. We also worked on a variety of issues relating to the implementation of the single security, including accounting matters, communication planning, industry outreach, risk assessments, privacy matters, legal and contractual issues, and disclosures. See &#8220;Housing Finance Reform&#8212;Conservator Developments&#8221; for more information on the single security and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks to our business associated with a single security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Nonperforming Loan Sales. &#32;FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to reducing the number of our severely aged delinquent loans, including through nonperforming loan sales. In March 2015, FHFA announced enhanced requirements for nonperforming loan sales by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the announcement, the Director of FHFA indicated FHFA&#8217;s expectation that, with these enhanced requirements, nonperforming loan sales will result in more favorable outcomes for borrowers and local communities. We completed three &#32;nonperforming loan sales in 2015, selling more than 10,000 &#32;nonperforming loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2.1 billion . Our second nonperforming loan sale transaction included a community impact pool of nonperforming loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $5 million &#32;that was specifically structured to attract diverse participation by non-profits, small investors and minority- and women-owned businesses. &#32; We plan to complete additional nonperforming loan sales. 

Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative. We are working with FHFA, Freddie Mac and the National Community Stabilization Trust on a neighborhood stabilization initiative that is focused on disposing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac REO properties in specified communities across the country where the number of REO properties remains elevated. This initiative began in two communities and was expanded to eighteen metropolitan areas in December 2015. In these areas, community organizations are given the opportunity to purchase foreclosed properties owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac prior to the properties being made publicly available for purchase. 

Mortgage Insurance. FHFA&#8217;s 2015 conservatorship scorecard includes an objective that we implement final private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements for our counterparties. These reforms are intended to strengthen our mortgage insurer counterparties and reduce the risk to taxpayers of future defaults by mortgage insurers on their obligations to the GSEs. In April 2015, we published updated eligibility standards for approved private mortgage insurers, which were further revised in June 2015 and December 2015. The new standards include enhanced financial requirements and are designed to ensure that mortgage insurers have sufficient liquid assets to pay all claims under a hypothetical future stress scenario. The new standards also set forth enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that may be imposed should an approved mortgage insurer fail to comply with the revised requirements. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management&#8212;Credit Guarantors&#8212;Mortgage Insurers&#8221; for additional information on these new standards. 

Eligibility Requirements for Seller-Servicers . FHFA&#8217;s 2015 conservatorship scorecard includes an objective that we enhance servicer eligibility standards for our counterparties. In May 2015, we and Freddie Mac issued new operational and financial eligibility requirements for our single-family mortgage seller-servicer counterparties. The operational requirements became effective September 1, 2015 and the financial requirements became effective December 31, 2015. These updated eligibility requirements are designed to better address the risks associated with emerging servicer business models and include a new minimum liquidity requirement for non-depository servicers. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management&#8212;Mortgage Sellers and Servicers&#8221; for a description of these new eligibility requirements. 

Mortgage Data Standardization Initiatives. FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to support of mortgage data standardization initiatives. These initiatives are designed to improve the accuracy and quality of loan data through the mortgage lifecycle with the development and implementation of uniform data standards for single-family mortgages. 

For more information on FHFA&#8217;s 2015 conservatorship scorecard objectives and our performance against these objectives, see &#8220;Executive Compensation&#8212;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Determination of 2015 Compensation&#8212;Assessment of Corporate Performance on 2015 Conservatorship Scorecard.&#8221; For more information on FHFA&#8217;s 2016 conservatorship scorecard objectives, see &#8220;Housing Finance Reform&#8212;Conservator Developments&#8221; and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on December 17, 2015. 

Treasury Draws and Dividend Payments 

From 2009 through the first quarter of 2012, we received a total of $116.1 billion &#32;from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. This funding provided us with the capital and liquidity needed to fulfill our mission of providing 

liquidity and support to the nation&#8217;s housing finance markets and to avoid triggering mandatory receivership under the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 (the &#8220;2008 Reform Act&#8221;). In addition, a portion of the $116.1 billion &#32;we received from Treasury was drawn to pay dividends to Treasury because, prior to 2013, our dividend payments on the senior preferred stock accrued at an annual rate of 10%, and we were directed by our conservator to pay these dividends to Treasury each quarter even when we did not have sufficient income to pay the dividend. We have not received funds from Treasury under the agreement since the first quarter of 2012. As of the date of this filing, the maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement is $117.6 billion . 

From 2008 through 2015, we paid a total of $144.8 billion &#32;in dividends to Treasury on the senior preferred stock. Under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, dividend payments do not offset prior Treasury draws, and we are not permitted to pay down draws we have made under the agreement except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, the current aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock is $117.1 billion , due to the initial $1.0 billion &#32;liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock (for which we did not receive cash proceeds) and the $116.1 billion &#32;we have drawn from Treasury. 

The Director of FHFA directs us to make dividend payments on the senior preferred stock on a quarterly basis. We expect to pay Treasury a senior preferred stock dividend of $2.9 billion &#32;by March 31, 2016 for the first quarter of 2016. 

Outlook 

Uncertainty Regarding our Future Status. We expect continued significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company and the housing finance system, including how long the company will continue to exist in its current form, the extent of our role in the market, how long we will be in conservatorship, what form we will have and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated, and whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. 

We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or final content of housing finance reform legislation. See &#8220;Housing Finance Reform&#8221; for a discussion of proposals for reform of the housing finance system, including the GSEs, that could materially affect our business, including proposals to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks to our business relating to the uncertain future of our company. 

Financial Results. Our financial results continued to be strong in 2015, with net income of $11.0 billion . We expect to remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future; however, certain factors, such as changes in interest rates or home prices, could result in significant volatility in our financial results from quarter to quarter or year to year. Our future financial results also will be affected by a number of other factors, including: our guaranty fee rates; the volume of single-family mortgage originations in the future; the size, composition and quality of our retained mortgage portfolio and guaranty book of business; and economic and housing market conditions. Our expectations for our future financial results do not take into account the impact on our business of potential future legislative or regulatory changes, which could have a material impact on our financial results, particularly the enactment of housing finance reform legislation as noted in &#8220;Uncertainty Regarding our Future Status&#8221; above. 

Under the terms of the senior preferred stock, our capital reserve will decline by $600 million each year until it reaches zero in 2018. Although we expect to remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future, due to our declining capital reserve and the potential for significant volatility in our financial results, we could experience a net worth deficit in a future quarter, particularly as our capital reserve approaches or reaches zero. If that were to occur, we would be required to draw additional funds from Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement in order to avoid being placed into receivership. As of the date of this filing, the maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement is $117.6 billion . If we were to draw additional funds from Treasury under the agreement in a future period, the amount of remaining funding under the agreement would be reduced by the amount of our draw. Dividend payments we make to Treasury do not restore or increase the amount of funding available to us under the agreement. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks associated with our declining capital reserves. 

Revenues. &#32; We currently have two primary sources of revenues: (1) the guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties; and (2) the difference between interest income earned on the assets in our retained mortgage portfolio and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those assets. In recent years, an increasing portion of our net interest income has been derived from guaranty fees rather than from our retained mortgage portfolio assets, due to the impact of guaranty fee increases implemented in 2012 and the reduction of our retained mortgage portfolio. Approximately two-thirds of our 2015 net interest income was derived from the loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts. The net interest income generated by loans underlying our Fannie Mae MBS in consolidated trusts primarily consists of guaranty fees. We expect that guaranty fees will continue to account for an increasing portion of our net interest income. 

We expect continued decreases in the size of our retained mortgage portfolio, which will continue to negatively impact our net interest income and net revenues; however, we also expect increases in our guaranty fee revenues will partially offset the negative impact of the decline in our retained mortgage portfolio. We expect our guaranty fee revenues to increase over the next several years, as loans with lower guaranty fees liquidate from our book of business and are replaced with new loans with higher guaranty fees. The extent to which the positive impact of increased guaranty fee revenues will offset the negative impact of the decline in the size of our retained mortgage portfolio will depend on many factors, including: changes to guaranty fee pricing we may make in the future and their impact on our competitive environment and guaranty fee revenues; the size, composition and quality of our guaranty book of business; the life of the loans in our guaranty book of business; the size, composition and quality of our retained mortgage portfolio; economic and housing market conditions, including changes in interest rates; our market share; and legislative and regulatory changes. 

Dividend Obligations to Treasury. We expect to retain only a limited amount of any future net worth because we are required by the dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock and quarterly directives from our conservator to pay Treasury each quarter the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount. This capital reserve amount is $1.2 billion &#32;for each quarter of 2016, will decrease to $600 million in 2017 and will decrease to zero in 2018. 

As described in &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220; Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies ,&#8221; several lawsuits have been filed by preferred and common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac against the United States, Treasury and/or FHFA challenging actions taken by the defendants relating to the senior preferred stock purchase agreements and the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including challenges to the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock. We cannot predict the course or the outcome of these lawsuits, or the actions the U.S. government (including Treasury or FHFA) may take in response to any ruling or finding in any of these lawsuits. 

Overall Market Conditions. While we expect the single-family serious delinquency rate for the overall mortgage market will continue to decline, we believe the rate of decline will be gradual. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, 80% &#32;of single-family seriously delinquent loans as of September 30, 2015 were originated prior to 2009. We expect the national single-family serious delinquency rate will remain high compared with pre-housing crisis levels because it will take some time for the remaining delinquent loans originated prior to 2009 to work their way through the foreclosure process. 

We forecast that total originations in the U.S. single-family mortgage market in 2016 will decrease from 2015 levels by approximately 11% &#32;from an estimated $1.69 trillion &#32;in 2015 to $1.51 trillion &#32;in 2016, and that the amount of originations in the U.S. single-family mortgage market that are refinancings will decrease from an estimated $795 billion &#32;in 2015 to $558 billion &#32;in 2016. 

Home Prices. Based on our home price index, we estimate that home prices on a national basis increased by 5.1% &#32;in 2015. We expect the rate of home price appreciation in 2016 to be similar to the rate in 2015. Future home price changes may be very different from our expectations as a result of &#32; significant inherent uncertainty in the current market environment, including uncertainty about the effect of recent and future changes in mortgage rates; actions the federal government has taken and may take with respect to fiscal policies, mortgage finance programs and policies, and housing finance reform; the Federal Reserve&#8217;s purchases and sales of mortgage-backed securities; the impact of those actions on and changes generally in unemployment and the general economic and interest rate environment; and the impact on the U.S. economy of global economic and political conditions. We also expect significant regional variation in the timing and rate of home price growth. 

Credit Losses. Our credit losses, which include our charge-offs, net of recoveries, reflect our realization of losses on our loans. Our credit losses were $10.7 billion &#32;in 2015, up from $5.9 billion &#32;in 2014. Our credit losses increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to our approach to adopting the charge-off provisions of FHFA&#8217;s Advisory Bulletin AB 2012-02, &#8220;Framework for Adversely Classifying Loans, Other Real Estate Owned, and Other Assets and Listing Assets for Special Mention&#8221; (the &#8220;Advisory Bulletin&#8221;) on January 1, 2015, a change in our accounting policy for nonaccrual loans, the recognition of losses associated with the redesignation of certain nonperforming single-family loans from HFI to HFS and an increase in operating expenses on our single-family foreclosed properties. Our credit losses for 2015 reflect $2.5 billion &#32;in initial charge-offs associated with our approach to adopting the charge-off provisions of the Advisory Bulletin and $1.1 billion &#32;in charge-offs relating to the change in accounting policy for nonaccrual loans. We expect our credit losses to be lower in 2016 and future years than our 2015 credit losses, absent further significant redesignations or accounting policy changes. For further information about our implementation of the Advisory Bulletin and our change in accounting policy for nonaccrual loans, see &#8220;Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.&#8221; For further information about our 2015 credit losses as compared with our 2014 credit losses, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8212;Credit-Related Income (Expense)&#8212;Credit Loss Performance Metrics.&#8221; 

Loss Reserves. Our combined loss reserves were $28.6 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015, down from $36.8 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2014. Our loss reserves have declined substantially from their peak and are expected to decline further. For a discussion of the factors that contributed to the decline in our loss reserves in 2015, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8212;Credit-Related Income (Expense)&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis&#8212;Mortgage Loans.&#8221; 

Factors that Could Cause Actual Results to be Materially Different from Our Estimates and Expectations. We present a number of estimates and expectations in this executive summary regarding our future performance, including estimates and expectations regarding our future financial results and profitability, the level and sources of our future revenues and net interest income, our future dividend payments to Treasury, the level and credit characteristics of, and the credit risk posed by, our future acquisitions, our future credit losses and our future loss reserves. We also present a number of estimates and expectations in this executive summary regarding future housing market conditions, including expectations regarding future single-family loan delinquency rates, future mortgage originations, future refinancings and future home prices. These estimates and expectations are forward-looking statements based on our current assumptions regarding numerous factors. Our future estimates of our performance and housing market conditions, as well as the actual results, may differ materially from our current estimates and expectations as a result of: the timing and level of, as well as regional variation in, home price changes; changes in interest rates, unemployment rates and other macroeconomic and housing market variables; our future guaranty fee pricing and the impact of that pricing on our guaranty fee revenues and competitive environment; our future serious delinquency rates; our future objectives and activities in support of those objectives, including actions we may take to reach additional underserved creditworthy borrowers; future legislative or regulatory requirements or changes that have a significant impact on our business, such as the enactment of housing finance reform legislation; actions we may be required to take by FHFA, in its role as our conservator or as our regulator, such as changes in the type of business we do, a requirement that we implement a principal forgiveness program or implementation of a single GSE security; limitations on our business imposed by FHFA, in its role as our conservator or as our regulator; future updates to our models relating to our loss reserves, including the assumptions used by these models; future changes to our accounting policies; significant changes in modification and foreclosure activity; the volume and pace of future nonperforming loan sales and their impact on our results and serious delinquency rates; changes in borrower behavior, such as an increasing number of underwater borrowers who strategically default on their mortgage loans; the effectiveness of our loss mitigation strategies, management of our REO inventory and pursuit of contractual remedies; whether our counterparties meet their obligations in full; resolution or settlement agreements we may enter into with our counterparties; changes in the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, including any change in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy towards the reinvestment of principal payments of mortgage-backed securities or any future sales of such securities; changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities; changes in generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;); credit availability; global political risks; natural disasters, environmental disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other major disruptive events; information security breaches; and other factors, including those discussed in &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements,&#8221; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and elsewhere in this report. Due to the large size of our guaranty book of business, even small changes in these factors could have a significant impact on our financial results for a particular period. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET 

&#160; 

The U.S. Residential Mortgage Market 

We conduct business in the U.S. residential mortgage market and the global securities market. According to the Federal Reserve, total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding, which includes $10.0 trillion &#32;of single-family mortgage debt outstanding, was estimated to be approximately $11.0 trillion &#32;as of September 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information is available). We owned or guaranteed mortgage assets representing approximately 28% &#32;of total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding as of September 30, 2015. 

We operate our business solely in the United States and its territories, and accordingly, we generate no revenue from and have no long-lived assets, other than financial instruments, in geographic locations other than the United States and its territories. 

Housing and Mortgage Market and Economic Conditions 

According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis advance estimate, the inflation-adjusted U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP, rose by 2.4% &#32;in both 2015 and 2014. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of January 2016, the economy created an estimated 2.8 million &#32;non-farm jobs in 2015 &#32;and 3.0 million &#32;non-farm jobs in 2014 . The unemployment rate declined to 5.0% &#32;in December 2015 &#32;from 5.6% &#32;in December 2014 . In January 2016, non-farm payrolls increased by 151,000 &#32;jobs, and the unemployment rate decreased to 4.9% . 

The most comprehensive measure of the unemployment rate, which includes those working part-time who would rather work full-time and those not looking for work but who want to work and are available for work, declined to 9.9% &#32;in December 2015 from 11.2% &#32;in December 2014. 

Housing activity improved in 2015 as compared with 2014. Total existing home sales of 5.3 million &#32;units in 2015 represent an increase of 6.5% &#32;from 2014, compared with a 2.9% &#32;decrease in 2014, according to data from the National Association of REALTORS &#174; . Sales of foreclosed homes and preforeclosure, or &#8220;short,&#8221; sales (together, &#8220;distressed sales&#8221;) accounted for 8% &#32;of existing home sales in December 2015, compared with 11% &#32;in December 2014. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, new single-family home sales increased 14.5% &#32;in 2015, after increasing by 1.9% &#32;in 2014. Homebuilding activity continued to increase in 2015, as single-family housing starts rose approximately 10% &#32;in 2015, compared with an increase of 5% &#32;in 2014. Multifamily starts rose approximately 11% &#32;in 2015, compared with an increase of 16% &#32;in 2014. 

At the end of 2015 , the number of months&#8217; supply, or the inventory/sales ratio, of available existing homes and of new homes were each below their historical average. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the months&#8217; supply of new single-family unsold homes was 5.2 &#32;months as of December 31, 2015, compared with 5.1 &#32;months as of December 31, 2014. According to the National Association of REALTORS &#174; , the months&#8217; supply of existing unsold homes was 3.9 &#32;months as of December 31, 2015, compared with a 4.4 &#32;months&#8217; supply as of December 31, 2014. 

The overall mortgage market serious delinquency rate fell to 3.4% as of December 31, 2015, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association&#8217;s National Delinquency Survey, its lowest level since the third quarter of 2007, compared with 4.5% &#32;as of December 31, 2014. We provide information about Fannie Mae&#8217;s serious delinquency rate, which also decreased during 2015, in &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Single-Family Guaranty Book of Business&#8212;Credit Performance.&#8221; 

Despite recent improvement in the housing market and declining delinquency rates, approximately one out of fifteen &#32;borrowers was delinquent or in foreclosure during the fourth quarter of 2015 , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey. 

Table 3 displays several key indicators related to the total U.S. residential mortgage market.

The sources of the housing and mortgage market data in this table are the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Census Bureau, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Association of REALTORS &#174; &#32;and the Mortgage Bankers Association. Home sales data are based on information available through December 2015. Single-family mortgage originations, as well as refinance shares, are based on February 2016 estimates from Fannie Mae&#8217;s Economic &#38; Strategic Research group. The adjustable-rate mortgage share is based on the number of conventional mortgage applications data reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association. Certain previously reported data may have been changed to reflect revised historical data from any or all of these organizations. 

(2) &#160; 

Calculated internally using property data information on loans purchased by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other third-party home sales data. Fannie Mae&#8217;s HPI is a weighted repeat transactions index, measuring average price changes in repeat sales on the same properties. Fannie Mae&#8217;s HPI excludes prices on properties sold in foreclosure. The reported home price change reflects the percentage change in Fannie Mae&#8217;s HPI from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the reported year. 

(3) &#160; 

Based on the annual average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rate reported by Freddie Mac. 

(4) &#160; 

U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding information for 2015 is provided as of September 30, 2015, the latest date for which information is available. 

Based on our home price index, we estimate that home prices on a national basis increased by 5.1% &#32;in 2015, following increases of 4.4% &#32;in 2014 and 7.9% &#32;in 2013. Despite the recent increases in home prices, we estimate that, through December 31, 2015, home prices on a national basis remained 6.0% &#32;below their peak in the third quarter of 2006. Our home price estimates are based on preliminary data and are subject to change as additional data become available. 

Despite the recent increases in home prices, many homeowners continue to have &#8220;negative equity&#8221; in their homes as a result of declines in home prices since 2006, which means their mortgage principal balance exceeds the current market value of their home. This increases the likelihood that borrowers will abandon their mortgage obligations and that the loans will become delinquent and proceed to foreclosure. According to CoreLogic, Inc., the number of residential properties with mortgages in a negative equity position in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately 4.1 million , down from 5.2 million &#32;in the third quarter of 2014. The percentage of properties with mortgages in a negative equity position in the third quarter of 2015 was 8.1% , down from 10.4% &#32;in the third quarter of 2014. 

Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates primarily increased during the year, starting at 3.73% &#32;for the week of January 8, 2015 and ending at 4.01% &#32;for the week of December 31, 2015, according to the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey &#174; . 

Although mortgage rates trended up in 2015, the average mortgage rate in 2015 was lower than in 2014, which contributed to an increase in single-family mortgage originations in 2015. We estimate that total single-family mortgage originations increased by approximately 30% &#32;to $1.69 trillion &#32;in 2015, compared with $1.30 trillion &#32;in 2014, and that the amount of single-family mortgage originations that were refinancings increased by approximately 53% &#32;to $795 billion &#32;in 2015, compared with $518 billion &#32;in 2014. 

We estimate that the amount of single-family mortgage debt outstanding rose slightly in 2015. As of September 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information is available), total single-family mortgage debt outstanding was $10.0 trillion , an increase of 0.9% &#32;from the amount of total single-family mortgage debt outstanding as of September 30, 2014. T otal U.S. residential mortgage debt outstandin g increased by 1.7% &#32;from the third quarter of 2014 &#32;to the third quarter of 2015 . 

National multifamily market fundamentals, which include factors such as vacancy rates and rents, remained relatively stable during 2015, despite an increase in new apartment supply. Although the national estimated vacancy level increased toward the end of the year, it remained near historic lows, benefiting from steady rental demand coupled with ongoing job growth and new household formation. Rent growth slowed during the fourth quarter of 2015, but remained positive. According to preliminary third-party data, the national multifamily vacancy rate for institutional investment-type apartment properties was an estimated 5.0% &#32;as of December 31, 2015, up from an estimated 4.75% &#32;as of September 30, 2015 and the same as the estimated 5.0% &#32;as of December 31, 2014. 

Effective rents continued to increase during 2015, although the rate of growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2015. National asking rents increased by an estimated 3.0% &#32;in 2015 but only by an estimated 0.25% &#32;during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an estimated increase of 1.25% &#32;in the third quarter of 2015. 

Continued demand for multifamily rental units was reflected in the estimated positive net absorption (that is, the net change in the number of occupied rental units during the time period) of approximately 165,000 &#32;units in 2015, according to preliminary data from Reis, Inc. There was positive net absorption of approximately 34,000 &#32;units during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with approximately 37,000 &#32;units during the third quarter of 2015. Although an estimated 276,000 &#32;multifamily units were added to the nation&#8217;s inventory in 2015, demand remained steady. 

Vacancy rates and rents are important to loan performance because multifamily loans are generally repaid from the cash flows generated by the underlying property. Several years of improvement in these fundamentals helped to increase property values in most metropolitan areas in 2015, and contributed to the ongoing increase in new multifamily construction development. As a result, it is estimated that there will be approximately 384,000 &#32;new multifamily units completed in 2016. The bulk of this new supply is concentrated in a limited number of metropolitan areas. We believe this increase in supply will result in a temporary slowdown in net absorption rates, occupancy levels and effective rents in those areas throughout 2016. Nevertheless, we expect the overall national rental market supply and demand to remain in balance over the longer term, based on expected construction completions, expected obsolescence and positive rental household formation trends. 

MORTGAGE SECURITIZATIONS 

We support market liquidity by issuing Fannie Mae MBS that are readily traded in the capital markets. We create Fannie Mae MBS by placing mortgage loans in a trust and issuing Fannie Mae MBS that are backed by those mortgage loans. Monthly 

payments received on the loans are the primary source of payments passed through to Fannie Mae MBS holders. We guarantee to the MBS trust that we will supplement amounts received by the MBS trust as required to permit timely payment of principal and interest on the trust certificates. In return for this guaranty, we receive guaranty fees. 

Below we discuss (1) two broad categories of securitization transactions: lender swaps and portfolio securitizations; (2) features of our MBS trusts; (3) circumstances under which we purchase loans from MBS trusts; and (4) single-class and multi-class Fannie Mae MBS. 

Lender Swaps and Portfolio Securitizations 

We currently securitize a substantial majority of the single-family and multifamily mortgage loans we acquire. Our securitization transactions primarily fall within two broad categories: lender swap transactions and portfolio securitizations. 

Our most common type of securitization transaction is our &#8220;lender swap transaction.&#8221; Mortgage lenders that operate in the primary mortgage market generally deliver pools of mortgage loans to us in exchange for Fannie Mae MBS backed by these mortgage loans. A pool of mortgage loans is a group of mortgage loans with similar characteristics. After receiving the mortgage loans in a lender swap transaction, we place them in a trust for which we serve as trustee. This trust is established for the sole purpose of holding the mortgage loans separate and apart from our corporate assets. We deliver to the lender (or its designee) Fannie Mae MBS that are backed by the pool of mortgage loans in the trust and that represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in each of the mortgage loans. We guarantee to each MBS trust that we will supplement amounts received by the MBS trust as required to permit timely payment of principal and interest on the related Fannie Mae MBS. We retain a portion of the interest payment as a fee for providing our guaranty. The mortgage servicer also retains a portion of the interest payment as a fee for servicing the loan. Then, on behalf of the trust, we make monthly distributions to the Fannie Mae MBS certificateholders from the principal and interest payments and other collections on the underlying mortgage loans. 

In contrast to our lender swap securitizations, in which lenders deliver pools of mortgage loans to us that we immediately place in a trust for securitization, our &#8220;portfolio securitization transactions&#8221; involve creating and issuing Fannie Mae MBS using mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities that we hold in our retained mortgage portfolio. 

Features of Our MBS Trusts 

Our MBS trusts hold either single-family or multifamily mortgage loans or mortgage-related securities. Each trust operates in accordance with a trust agreement or a trust indenture. Each MBS trust is also governed by an issue supplement documenting the formation of that MBS trust, the identification of its related assets and the issuance of the related Fannie Mae MBS. The trust agreement or the trust indenture, together with the issue supplement and any amendments, are considered the &#8220;trust documents&#8221; that govern an individual MBS trust. 

Purchases of Loans from our MBS Trusts 

Under the terms of our MBS trust documents, we have the option or, in some instances, the obligation, to purchase mortgage loans that meet specific criteria from an MBS trust. For example, we have the option under the terms of the trust documents to purchase a loan from an MBS trust if the loan is delinquent as to four or more consecutive monthly payments. We generally have the obligation to purchase a mortgage loan from an MBS trust when the mortgage loan becomes delinquent as to 24 monthly payments. Our acquisition cost for these loans is the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus accrued interest. 

In deciding whether and when to exercise our option to purchase a loan from a single-family MBS trust, we consider a variety of factors, including: our legal ability to purchase loans under the terms of the trust documents; whether we have agreed to modify the loan, which we currently cannot do while it remains in trust; our mission and public policy; our loss mitigation strategies and the exposure to credit losses we face under our guaranty; our cost of funds; the impact on our results of operations; relevant market yields; the accounting impact; the administrative costs associated with purchasing and holding the loans; counterparty exposure to lenders that have agreed to cover losses associated with delinquent loans; and general market conditions. The weight we give to these factors changes depending on market circumstances and other factors. 

The cost of purchasing most delinquent loans from Fannie Mae MBS trusts and holding them in our retained mortgage portfolio is currently less than the cost of advancing delinquent payments to security holders. We generally purchase loans from MBS trusts as they become four or more consecutive monthly payments delinquent. During 2015 , we purchased delinquent loans with an unpaid principal balance of $13.2 billion &#32;from our single-family MBS trusts. We expect to continue purchasing loans from MBS trusts as they become four or more consecutive monthly payments delinquent subject to market conditions, economic benefit, servicer capacity and other factors, including the limit on the amount of mortgage assets that we may own pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and FHFA&#8217;s portfolio plan requirements. 

For our multifamily MBS trusts, we typically exercise our option to purchase a loan from the trust if the loan is delinquent as to four or more consecutive monthly payments, whether those payments were made in whole or in part. 

Single-Class and Multi-Class Fannie Mae MBS 

Fannie Mae MBS trusts may be single-class or multi-class. Single-class MBS are MBS in which the investors receive principal and interest payments on the mortgage loans backing the MBS directly in proportion to their percentage ownership of the MBS issuance. Multi-class MBS are MBS, including Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (&#8220;REMICs&#8221;), in which the cash flows on the underlying mortgage assets are divided, creating several classes of securities, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the related MBS trust and entitles the related holder to a specific portion of cash flows. Terms to maturity of some multi-class Fannie Mae MBS, particularly REMIC classes, may match or be shorter than the maturity of the underlying mortgage loans and/or mortgage-related securities. After these classes mature, cash flows received on the underlying mortgage assets are allocated to the remaining classes in accordance with the payment terms of the securities. As a result, each of the classes in a multi-class MBS may have a different coupon rate, average life, repayment sensitivity or final maturity. Structured Fannie Mae MBS are either multi-class MBS or single-class MBS that are typically resecuritizations of other single-class Fannie Mae MBS. In a resecuritization, pools of MBS are collected and securitized.

Single-Family Business 

Working with our lender customers, our Single-Family business provides funds to the mortgage market by acquiring single-family loans through lender swap transactions or, working also with our Capital Markets group, through loan purchases. Our Single-Family business has primary responsibility for pricing and managing the credit risk on our single-family guaranty book of business, which consists of single-family mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS and single-family loans held in our retained mortgage portfolio. 

A single-family loan is secured by a property with four or fewer residential units. Our Single-Family business and Capital Markets group securitize and purchase primarily conventional (not federally insured or guaranteed) single-family fixed-rate or adjustable-rate, first-lien mortgage loans, or mortgage-related securities backed by these types of loans. We also securitize or purchase loans insured by FHA, loans guaranteed by the VA, loans guaranteed by the Rural Development Housing and Community Facilities Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, manufactured housing loans and other mortgage-related securities. 

Revenues for our Single-Family business are derived primarily from guaranty fees received as compensation for assuming the credit risk on the mortgage loans underlying single-family Fannie Mae MBS. We also allocate guaranty fee revenues to the Single-Family business for assuming and managing the credit risk on the single-family mortgage loans held in our retained mortgage portfolio. The aggregate amount of single-family guaranty fees we receive or that are allocated to our Single-Family business in any period depends on the amount of single-family Fannie Mae MBS outstanding and loans held in our retained mortgage portfolio during the period and the applicable guaranty fee rates. The amount of Fannie Mae MBS outstanding at any time is primarily determined by the rate at which we issue new Fannie Mae MBS and by the repayment rate for the loans underlying our outstanding Fannie Mae MBS. 

We describe the credit risk management process employed by our Single-Family business, with oversight from our Single-Family Enterprise Risk Management group, including its key strategies in managing credit risk and key metrics used in measuring and evaluating our single-family credit risk, in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management.&#8221; 

Single-Family Mortgage Securitizations and Other Acquisitions 

Our Single-Family business securitizes single-family mortgage loans and issues single-class Fannie Mae MBS, which are described above in &#8220;Mortgage Securitizations&#8212;Single-Class and Multi-Class Fannie Mae MBS,&#8221; for our lender customers. Unlike our Capital Markets group, which securitizes loans from our retained mortgage portfolio, our Single-Family business securitizes loans solely in lender swap transactions. We describe lender swap transactions, and how they differ from portfolio securitizations, in &#8220;Mortgage Securitizations&#8212;Lender Swaps and Portfolio Securitizations.&#8221; Our Single-Family business also works with our Capital Markets group to acquire single-family loans through purchases of loans. 

Loans from our lender customers are delivered to us through either our &#8220;flow&#8221; or &#8220;bulk&#8221; transaction channels. In our flow business, we enter into agreements that generally set agreed-upon guaranty fees and other contract terms for a lender&#8217;s future delivery of individual loans to us over a specified time period. Our bulk business generally consists of transactions in which a set of loans is delivered to us in bulk, typically with guaranty fees and other contract terms negotiated individually for each transaction. 

Single-Family Mortgage Servicing, REO Management, and Lender Repurchase Evaluations 

Servicing 

Generally, the servicing of the mortgage loans that are held in our retained mortgage portfolio or that back our Fannie Mae MBS is performed by mortgage servicers on our behalf. Some loans are serviced for us by the lenders that initially sold the loans to us. In other cases, our loans are serviced by third-party servicers that did not originate or sell the loans to us. For loans we own or guarantee, the lender or servicer must obtain our approval before selling servicing rights to another servicer. 

Our mortgage servicers typically collect and deliver principal and interest payments, administer escrow accounts, monitor and report delinquencies, perform default prevention activities, evaluate transfers of ownership interests, respond to requests for partial releases of security, and handle proceeds from casualty and condemnation losses. Our mortgage servicers are the primary point of contact for borrowers and perform a key role in the effective implementation of our homeownership assistance initiatives, negotiation of workouts of troubled loans, and other loss mitigation activities. If necessary, mortgage servicers inspect and preserve properties and process foreclosures and bankruptcies. Because we generally delegate the servicing of our mortgage loans to mortgage servicers and do not have our own servicing function, our ability to actively manage troubled loans that we own or guarantee is limited. For more information on the risks of our reliance on servicers, refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Institutional Counterparty Credit Risk Management.&#8221; 

We compensate servicers primarily by permitting them to retain a specified portion of each interest payment on a serviced mortgage loan as a servicing fee. Servicers also generally retain assumption fees, late payment charges and other similar charges, to the extent they are collected from borrowers, as additional servicing compensation. We also compensate servicers for negotiating workouts on problem loans. 

REO Management 

If a loan defaults and we acquire a home through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, we market and sell the home through local real estate professionals. Our primary objectives are both to minimize the severity of loss to Fannie Mae by maximizing sales prices and to stabilize neighborhoods by preventing empty homes from depressing home values. In cases where the property does not sell, we use alternative methods of disposition, including selling homes to municipalities, other public entities or non-profit organizations, and selling properties in bulk or through public auctions. 

Lender Repurchase Evaluations 

We conduct post-purchase quality control file reviews to ensure that loans sold to, and serviced for, us meet our guidelines. If we discover violations through reviews, we generally issue repurchase demands to the seller or other responsible party and seek to collect on our repurchase claims; however, under our revised representation and warranty framework, we no longer require repurchase for loans that have breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if they have met specified criteria for relief. We discuss changes we have made to our post-purchase loan review process and our representation and warranty framework in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Acquisition and Servicing Policies and Underwriting and Servicing Standards.&#8221; 

Single-Family Credit Risk Transfer Transactions 

Our Single-Family business has developed risk-sharing capabilities to transfer portions of our single-family mortgage credit risk to the private market. The goal of these transactions is, to the extent economically sensible, to transfer a portion of the existing mortgage credit risk on a portion of recently-acquired loans in our single-family guaranty book of business in order to reduce the economic risk to us and to taxpayers of future borrower defaults. For a discussion of our single-family credit risk transfer transactions, see &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8212;Transfer of Mortgage Credit Risk&#8212;Credit Risk-Sharing Transactions.&#8221; 

Multifamily Business 

Our Multifamily business provides mortgage market liquidity for properties with five or more residential units, which may be apartment communities, cooperative properties, seniors housing, dedicated student housing or manufactured housing communities. Our Multifamily business works with our lender customers to provide funds to the mortgage market primarily by securitizing multifamily mortgage loans into Fannie Mae MBS. We also purchase multifamily mortgage loans and provide credit enhancement for bonds issued by state and local housing finance authorities to finance multifamily housing. 

Our Multifamily business also works with our Capital Markets group to facilitate the purchase and securitization of multifamily mortgage loans and securities. Our multifamily guaranty book of business consists primarily of multifamily mortgage loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS and multifamily loans held in our retained mortgage portfolio. Our Multifamily 

business has primary responsibility for pricing and managing the credit risk on our multifamily guaranty book of business, including managing the credit risk on multifamily loans and Fannie Mae MBS backed by multifamily loans that are held in our retained mortgage portfolio. 

We describe the credit risk management process employed by our Multifamily business, with oversight from our Multifamily Enterprise Risk Management group, including its key strategies in managing credit risk and key metrics used in measuring and evaluating our multifamily credit risk, in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management.&#8221; 

Revenues for our Multifamily business are derived from a variety of sources, including: (1) guaranty fees received as compensation for assuming credit risk on the mortgage loans underlying multifamily Fannie Mae MBS and on the multifamily mortgage loans held in our retained mortgage portfolio and on other mortgage-related securities; and (2) other fees associated with multifamily business activities. In addition, our Capital Markets group earns revenue generated from the difference between the interest income earned on the multifamily mortgage loans and securities held in our retained mortgage portfolio and the interest expense associated with the debt that funds those loans and securities, as well as yield maintenance income and revenue related to other market-making activity. 

Key Characteristics of the Multifamily Mortgage Market and Multifamily Transactions 

The multifamily mortgage market and our transactions in that market have a number of key characteristics that affect our multifamily activities and distinguish them from our activities in the single-family residential mortgage market. 

&#8226; 

Funding sources: The multifamily market is made up of a wide variety of lending sources, including commercial banks, life insurance companies, investment banks, FHA, state and local housing finance agencies, and the GSEs. 

&#8226; 

Lenders: &#32;During 2015 , we executed multifamily transactions with 28 &#32;lenders. Of these, 25 &#32;lenders delivered loans to us under our DUS program. In determining whether to partner with a multifamily lender, we consider the lender&#8217;s financial strength, multifamily underwriting and servicing experience, portfolio performance and willingness and ability to share in the risk of loss associated with the multifamily loans they originate. 

&#8226; 

Loan size: &#32;The average size of a loan in our multifamily guaranty book of business is $7 million . 

&#8226; 

Collateral: Multifamily loans are collateralized by properties that generate cash flows and effectively operate as businesses, such as garden and high-rise apartment complexes, seniors housing communities, cooperatives, dedicated student housing and manufactured housing communities. 

&#8226; 

Borrower and sponsor profile: Multifamily borrowers are entities that are typically owned, directly or indirectly, by for-profit corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, real estate investment trusts and individuals who invest in real estate for cash flow and equity returns in exchange for their original investment in the asset. The ultimate owners of a multifamily borrower are referred to as the borrower&#8217;s &#8220;sponsors.&#8221; In this report, we refer to both the borrowing entities and their sponsors as &#8220;borrowers.&#8221; Because borrowing entities are typically single-asset entities, with the property as their only asset, in evaluating a borrowing entity we also evaluate its sponsors. Multifamily loans are generally non-recourse to the sponsors. When considering a multifamily borrower, creditworthiness is evaluated through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data including liquid assets, net worth, number of units owned, experience in a market and/or property type, multifamily portfolio performance, access to additional liquidity, debt maturities, asset/property management platform, senior management experience, reputation and lender exposure. 

&#8226; 

Borrower and lender alignment: Borrowers are required to contribute equity into multifamily properties on which they borrow, while lenders generally share in any losses realized from the loans that we guarantee. 

&#8226; 

Underwriting process: Multifamily loans require detailed underwriting of the property&#8217;s operating cash flow. Our underwriting includes an evaluation of the property&#8217;s ability to support the loan, property quality, market and submarket factors, ability to exit at maturity and an initial risk categorization for the loan. 

&#8226; 

Term and lifecycle: In contrast to the standard 30-year single-family residential loan, multifamily loans typically have terms of 5 , 7 &#32;or 10 &#32;years, with balloon payments due at maturity. 

&#8226; 

Prepayment terms: Most multifamily Fannie Mae loans and MBS have protection against prepayments of loans and impose prepayment premiums, consistent with standard commercial investment terms. 

Multifamily Mortgage Securitizations 

Our Multifamily business generally creates multifamily Fannie Mae MBS in lender swap transactions in a manner similar to our Single-Family business, as described in &#8220;Single-Family Business&#8212;Single-Family Mortgage Securitizations and Other 

Acquisitions.&#8221; Our multifamily lender customers typically deliver only one mortgage loan to back each multifamily Fannie Mae MBS. The characteristics of each mortgage loan are used to establish guaranty fees on a risk-adjusted basis. Securitizing a single multifamily mortgage loan into a Fannie Mae MBS facilitates its sale into the secondary market. 

We also issue structured transactions backed by multifamily Fannie Mae MBS through the Fannie Mae Guaranteed Multifamily Structures (&#8220;Fannie Mae GeMS TM &#8221;) program. This provides additional liquidity and stability to the multifamily market, while expanding the investor base for multifamily Fannie Mae MBS. 

Delegated Underwriting and Servicing 

In an effort to promote product standardization in the multifamily marketplace, in 1988 Fannie Mae initiated the DUS program for acquiring individual multifamily loans. 

DUS is a unique business model in the commercial mortgage industry. The standard industry practice for a multifamily loan requires the purchaser or guarantor to underwrite or re-underwrite each loan prior to deciding whether to purchase or guaranty the loan. Under our model, DUS lenders are pre-approved and delegated the authority to underwrite and service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae. In exchange for this authority, DUS lenders are required to share with us the risk of loss over the life of the loan, as discussed in more detail in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Credit Risk Management&#8212;Multifamily Mortgage Credit Risk Management&#8212;Multifamily Acquisition Policy and Underwriting Standards.&#8221; Since DUS lenders share in the credit risk, the servicing fee to the lenders includes compensation for credit risk. Delegation permits lenders to respond to customers more rapidly, as the lender generally has the authority to approve a loan within prescribed parameters, which provides an important competitive advantage. 

Our DUS model aligns the interests of the lender and Fannie Mae. Our current 25 -member DUS lender network, which is comprised of large financial institutions and independent mortgage lenders, continues to be our principal source of multifamily loan deliveries. 

Multifamily Mortgage Servicing 

Multifamily mortgage servicing is typically performed by the lenders who sell the mortgages to us. Multifamily mortgage servicers that are members of our DUS network have agreed to accept loss sharing, which we believe increases the alignment of interests between us and our multifamily loan servicers. Because of our loss-sharing arrangements with our multifamily lenders, transfers of multifamily servicing rights are infrequent, and we carefully monitor our servicing relationships and enforce our right to approve servicing transfers. As a seller-servicer, the lender is responsible for evaluating the financial condition of properties and property owners, administering various types of agreements (including agreements regarding replacement reserves, completion or repair, and operations and maintenance), as well as conducting routine property inspections. 

The Multifamily Markets in Which We Operate 

In the multifamily mortgage market, we aim to address the rental housing needs of a wide range of the population in all markets across the country, with the substantial majority of our focus on supporting rental housing that is affordable to families earning at or below the median income in their area. Our mission requires us to serve the market steadily, rather than moving in and out depending on market conditions. Through the secondary mortgage market, we support rental housing for the workforce population, for senior citizens and students, and for families with the greatest economic need. Our Multifamily business is organized and operated as an integrated commercial real estate finance business, addressing the spectrum of multifamily housing finance needs, including the needs described below. 

&#8226; 

To meet the growing need for smaller multifamily property financing, we focus on the acquisition of multifamily loans up to $3 million &#32;( $5 million &#32;in high cost areas). We acquire these loans primarily from DUS lenders; however, we have also acquired these loans from other financial institutions. Over the years, we have been an active purchaser of these loans from both DUS and non-DUS lenders, and, as of December 31, 2015 , they represented 54% &#32;of our multifamily guaranty book of business by loan count and 10% &#32;based on unpaid principal balance. 

&#8226; 

To serve low- and very low-income households, we have a team that focuses exclusively on relationships with lenders financing privately-owned multifamily properties that receive public subsidies in exchange for maintaining long-term affordable rents. We enable borrowers to leverage housing programs and subsidies provided by local, state and federal agencies. These public subsidy programs are largely targeted to providing housing to families earning less than 60% &#32;of area median income (as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;)) and are structured to ensure that the low and very low-income households who benefit from the subsidies pay no more than 30% &#32;of their gross monthly income for rent and utilities. As of December 31, 2015 , this type of 

financing represented approximately 14% &#32;of our multifamily guaranty book of business, based on unpaid principal balance, including $13.3 billion &#32;in bond credit enhancements. 

Capital Markets 

Our Capital Markets group manages our mortgage-related assets and other interest-earning non-mortgage investments. We fund our purchases primarily through proceeds we receive from the issuance of debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets. Our Capital Markets group has primary responsibility for managing the interest rate risk associated with our investments in mortgage assets, with oversight from our Capital Markets Enterprise Risk Management group. 

Our Capital Markets group&#8217;s business activity is primarily focused on making short-term use of our balance sheet rather than on long-term investments. As a result, our Capital Markets group works with lender customers to provide funds to the mortgage market through short-term financing and investing activities . &#32;Activities we are undertaking to provide liquidity to the mortgage market include the following: 

&#8226; 

Whole Loan Conduit. Whole loan conduit activities involve our purchase of single-family loans principally for the purpose of securitizing them. We purchase loans from a large group of lenders and then securitize them as Fannie Mae MBS, which may then be sold to dealers and investors. 

&#8226; 

Early Funding. Lenders who deliver whole loans or pools of whole loans to us in exchange for MBS typically must wait between 30 and 45 days from the closing and settlement of the loans or pools and the issuance of the MBS. This delay may limit lenders&#8217; ability to originate new loans. Under our early lender funding programs, we purchase whole loans or pools of loans on an accelerated basis, allowing lenders to receive quicker payment for the whole loans and pools, which replenishes their funds and allows them to originate more mortgage loans. 

&#8226; 

REMICs and Other Structured Securitizations. We issue structured Fannie Mae MBS (including REMICs), typically for our lender customers or securities dealer customers, in exchange for a transaction fee. 

&#8226; 

MBS Trading. We regularly enter into purchase and sale transactions with other market participants involving mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, which we refer to as &#8220;agency MBS.&#8221; These transactions can provide for the future delivery of mortgage-backed securities with underlying single-family loans that share certain general characteristics (often referred to as the &#8220;TBA market&#8221;). These purchase and sale transactions also can provide for the future delivery of specifically identified mortgage-backed securities with underlying loans that have other characteristics considered desirable by some investors (often referred to as the &#8220;Specified Pools market&#8221;). Through our trading activity in the TBA and Specified Pools markets, we provide significant liquidity to the agency MBS markets. 

Securitization Activities 

Our Capital Markets group is engaged in issuing both single-class and multi-class Fannie Mae MBS through both portfolio securitizations and structured securitizations involving third-party assets. 

&#8226; 

Portfolio securitizations. &#32;Our Capital Markets group creates single-class and multi-class Fannie Mae MBS from mortgage-related assets held in our retained mortgage portfolio. Our Capital Markets group may sell these Fannie Mae MBS into the secondary market or may retain the Fannie Mae MBS in our retained mortgage portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Structured securitizations. Our Capital Markets group creates single-class and multi-class structured Fannie Mae MBS, typically for our lender customers or securities dealer customers, in exchange for a transaction fee. In these transactions, the customer &#8220;swaps&#8221; a mortgage-related asset that it owns (typically a mortgage security) in exchange for a structured Fannie Mae MBS we issue. The process for issuing Fannie Mae MBS in a structured securitization is similar to the process involved in our lender swap securitizations. For more information about that process and how it differs from portfolio securitizations, see &#8220;Mortgage Securitizations&#8212;Lender Swaps and Portfolio Securitizations.&#8221; 

For a description of single-class Fannie Mae MBS, see &#8220;Mortgage Securitizations&#8212;Single-Class and Multi-Class Fannie Mae MBS.&#8221; 

Other Customer Services 

Our Capital Markets group provides our lender customers with services that include offering to purchase mortgage assets; segregating customer portfolios to obtain optimal pricing for their mortgage loans; and assisting customers with hedging their mortgage business. These activities help to create a broader market for our customers and enhance liquidity in the secondary mortgage market. 

Retained Mortgage Portfolio 

Revenue from our Capital Markets group is derived primarily from the difference, or spread, between the interest we earn on our mortgage and non-mortgage investments and the interest we incur on the debt we issue to fund these assets. Our Capital Markets revenues are primarily derived from our retained mortgage portfolio. We expect these revenues to continue to decrease over time as the maximum allowable amount of mortgage assets we may own continues to decrease each year through 2018 under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury and pursuant to FHFA&#8217;s additional request that we cap our mortgage portfolio at 90% of the annual limit under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. See &#8220;Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements&#8212;Treasury Agreements&#8212;Covenants under Treasury Agreements&#8221; for more information on the decreasing limits on the amount of mortgage assets we are permitted to hold. 

We describe the interest rate risk management process employed by our Capital Markets group, including its key strategies in managing interest rate risk and key metrics used in measuring and evaluating our interest rate risk, in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Market Risk Management, Including Interest Rate Risk Management.&#8221; 

Liquidity Support and Financing Activities 

Our Capital Markets group seeks to increase the liquidity of the mortgage market by maintaining a presence as an active aggregator of mortgage loans and supports the liquidity of Fannie Mae MBS in a variety of market conditions. 

Our Capital Markets group funds its purchases primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in a wide range of maturities in the domestic and international capital markets. The most active investors in our debt securities include commercial bank portfolios and trust departments, investment fund managers, insurance companies, pension funds, state and local governments, and central banks. The approved dealers for underwriting various types of Fannie Mae debt securities may differ by funding program. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Management&#8212;Liquidity Management&#8221; for information on the composition of our outstanding debt and a discussion of our liquidity and debt activity. 

Our Capital Markets group&#8217;s liquidity support and financing activities are affected by market conditions. In addition, the Capital Markets group&#8217;s purchases are subject to contractual limitations, including the provisions of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury, and to regulatory constraints, to the extent described below under &#8220;Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements&#8221; and &#8220;Our Charter and Regulation of Our Activities.&#8221; 

CONSERVATORSHIP AND TREASURY AGREEMENTS 

Conservatorship 

On September 6, 2008, the Director of FHFA appointed FHFA as our conservator, pursuant to authority provided by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the 2008 Reform Act (together, the &#8220;GSE Act&#8221;). The conservatorship is a statutory process designed to preserve and conserve our assets and property and put the company in a sound and solvent condition. 

The conservatorship has no specified termination date and there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company, including how long the company will continue to exist in its current form, the extent of our role in the market, how long we will be in conservatorship, what form we will have and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and preferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated, and whether we will continue to exist following conservatorship. For more information on the risks to our business relating to the conservatorship and uncertainties regarding the future of our company and business, as well as the adverse effects of the conservatorship on the rights of holders of our common and preferred stock, see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Management of the Company during Conservatorship 

Upon its appointment, the conservator immediately succeeded to (1) all rights, titles, powers and privileges of Fannie Mae, and of any shareholder, officer or director of Fannie Mae with respect to Fannie Mae and its assets, and (2) title to the books, records and assets of any other legal custodian of Fannie Mae. The conservator subsequently delegated specified authorities to our Board of Directors and delegated to management the authority to conduct our day-to-day operations. In connection with its delegation of authority, FHFA has instructed the Board to oversee that management consult with and obtain the written approval of the conservator before taking action in any of the areas described in &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance&#8212;Corporate Governance&#8212;Conservatorship and Delegation of Authority to Board of Directors.&#8221; FHFA&#8217;s instructions also require the company to notify FHFA of planned changes in business processes or operations, so that FHFA may participate in decision-making as FHFA determines appropriate. The conservator retains the authority to amend or withdraw its delegations at any time. 

Our directors serve on behalf of the conservator and exercise their authority as directed by and with the approval, where required, of the conservator. Our directors have no fiduciary duties to any person or entity except to the conservator. Accordingly, our directors are not obligated to consider the interests of the company, the holders of our equity or debt securities or the holders of Fannie Mae MBS unless specifically directed to do so by the conservator. 

Because we are in conservatorship, our common stockholders currently do not have the ability to elect directors or to vote on other matters. The conservator eliminated common and preferred stock dividends (other than dividends on the senior preferred stock issued to Treasury) during the conservatorship, and we are no longer managed with a strategy to maximize shareholder returns. For additional information about our primary goals, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Our Strategy and Business Objectives,&#8221; and for additional information about the goals of the conservatorship, see &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Helping to Build a Sustainable Housing Finance System&#8221; and &#8220;Housing Finance Reform&#8212;Conservator Developments.&#8221; 

Powers of the Conservator under the GSE Act 

FHFA has broad powers when acting as our conservator. As conservator, FHFA can direct us to enter into contracts or enter into contracts on our behalf. Further, FHFA may transfer or sell any of our assets or liabilities (subject to limitations and post-transfer notice provisions for transfers of certain types of financial contracts), without any approval, assignment of rights or consent of any party. The GSE Act provides, however, that mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets that have been transferred to a Fannie Mae MBS trust must be held by the conservator for the beneficial owners of the Fannie Mae MBS and cannot be used to satisfy the general creditors of the company. For more information on FHFA&#8217;s powers as conservator and the rules governing conservatorship and receivership operations for the GSEs, see &#8220;Our Charter and Regulation of Our Activities&#8212;The GSE Act&#8212;Receivership.&#8221; 

Neither the conservatorship nor the terms of our agreements with Treasury change our obligation to make required payments on our debt securities or perform under our mortgage guaranty obligations. 

Under the GSE Act, FHFA must place us into receivership if the Director of FHFA makes a written determination that our assets are less than our obligations (that is, we have a net worth deficit) or if we have not been paying our debts, in either case, for a period of 60 days. In addition, the Director of FHFA may place us in receivership at his discretion at any time for &#32; other reasons set forth in the GSE Act, including if we are critically undercapitalized or if we are undercapitalized and have no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized. Placement into receivership would likely have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock and preferred stock, and could have a material adverse effect on holders of our debt securities and Fannie Mae MBS. Should we be placed into receivership, different assumptions would be required to determine the carrying value of our assets, which could lead to substantially different financial results. For more information on the risks to our business relating to conservatorship and uncertainties regarding the future of our business, see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Treasury Agreements 

On September 7, 2008, we, through FHFA, in its capacity as conservator, and Treasury entered into a senior preferred stock purchase agreement, which was amended and restated on September 26, 2008. The amended and restated agreement was subsequently amended on May 6, 2009, December 24, 2009 and August 17, 2012. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this report to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement refer to the agreement as amended through August 17, 2012. The terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, senior preferred stock and the warrant discussed below will continue to apply to us even if we are released from conservatorship. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a description of the risks to our business relating to the Treasury agreements, as well as the adverse effects of the senior preferred stock and the warrant on the rights of holders of our common stock and other series of preferred stock. 

Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and Related Issuance of Senior Preferred Stock and Common Stock Warrant 

Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement 

Under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, we issued to Treasury (a) one million shares of Variable Liquidation Preference Senior Preferred Stock, Series 2008-2, which we refer to as the &#8220;senior preferred stock,&#8221; and (b) a warrant to purchase, for a nominal price, shares of common stock equal to 79.9% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis at the time the warrant is exercised, which we refer to as the &#8220;warrant.&#8221; 

The senior preferred stock and warrant were issued to Treasury as an initial commitment fee in consideration of the commitment from Treasury to provide funds to us under the terms and conditions set forth in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. The senior preferred stock purchase agreement provides that, on a quarterly basis, we may draw funds up to the amount, if any, by which our total liabilities exceed our total assets, as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, prepared in accordance with GAAP, for the applicable fiscal quarter (referred to as the &#8220;deficiency amount&#8221;), up to the 

maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement. As of the date of this filing, the maximum amount of remaining funding under the agreement is $117.6 billion . If we were to draw additional funds from Treasury under the agreement in a future period, the amount of remaining funding under the agreement would be reduced by the amount of our draw. Dividend payments we make to Treasury do not restore or increase the amount of funding available to us under the agreement. The senior preferred stock purchase agreement provides that the deficiency amount will be calculated differently if we become subject to receivership or other liquidation process. 

The terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement provided for the payment of an unspecified quarterly commitment fee to Treasury; however, the August 2012 amendment to the agreement provided that this commitment fee will not be set, accrue or be payable, as long as the current dividend payment provisions of the senior preferred stock remain in effect. 

The senior preferred stock purchase agreement provides that Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment will terminate under any of the following circumstances: (1) the completion of our liquidation and fulfillment of Treasury&#8217;s obligations under its funding commitment at that time, (2) the payment in full of, or reasonable provision for, all of our liabilities (whether or not contingent, including mortgage guaranty obligations), or (3) the funding by Treasury of the maximum amount that may be funded under the agreement. In addition, Treasury may terminate its funding commitment and declare the senior preferred stock purchase agreement null and void if a court vacates, modifies, amends, conditions, enjoins, stays or otherwise affects the appointment of the conservator or otherwise curtails the conservator&#8217;s powers. Treasury may not terminate its funding commitment under the agreement solely by reason of our being in conservatorship, receivership or other insolvency proceeding, or due to our financial condition or any adverse change in our financial condition. 

The senior preferred stock purchase agreement provides that most provisions of the agreement may be waived or amended by mutual written agreement of the parties; however, no waiver or amendment of the agreement is permitted that would decrease Treasury&#8217;s aggregate funding commitment or add conditions to Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment if the waiver or amendment would adversely affect in any material respect the holders of our debt securities or guaranteed Fannie Mae MBS. 

In the event of our default on payments with respect to our debt securities or guaranteed Fannie Mae MBS, if Treasury fails to perform its obligations under its funding commitment and if we and/or the conservator are not diligently pursuing remedies in respect of that failure, the holders of our debt securities or Fannie Mae MBS may file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims for relief requiring Treasury to fund to us the lesser of (1) the amount necessary to cure the payment defaults on our debt and Fannie Mae MBS and (2) the lesser of (a) the deficiency amount and (b) the maximum amount that may be funded under the agreement less the aggregate amount of funding previously provided under the commitment. Any payment that Treasury makes under those circumstances will be treated for all purposes as a draw under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement that will increase the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. 

Senior Preferred Stock 

Pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, we issued one million shares of senior preferred stock to Treasury on September 8, 2008 with an aggregate initial liquidation preference of $1.0 billion . The stock&#8217;s liquidation preference is subject to adjustment. For any dividend period for which dividends are payable, to the extent that dividends are not paid in cash they will accrue and be added to the liquidation preference. In addition, any amounts Treasury pays to us pursuant to its funding commitment under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement and any quarterly commitment fees that are either not paid in cash to Treasury or not waived by Treasury will be added to the liquidation preference. Accordingly, the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock was $117.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

Treasury, as holder of the senior preferred stock, is entitled to receive, when, as and if declared, out of legally available funds, cumulative quarterly cash dividends. Pursuant to the August 2012 amendment to the agreement, beginning in 2013, the method for calculating the amount of dividends for each quarter was changed from an annual rate of 10% per year on the then-current liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock to an amount determined based on our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Our net worth as defined by the agreement is the amount, if any, by which our total assets (excluding Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment and any unfunded amounts related to the commitment) exceed our total liabilities (excluding any obligation in respect of capital stock), in each case as reflected on our balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP. For each dividend period from January 1, 2013 through and including December 31, 2017, the dividend amount will be the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount. The capital reserve amount was initially $3.0 billion &#32;for dividend periods in 2013 and decreases by $600 million &#32;each year until it reaches zero on January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the capital reserve amount was $1.8 billion &#32;for dividend periods in 2015 and decreased to $1.2 billion &#32;for dividend periods in 2016. The capital reserve amount will be $600 million &#32;for dividend periods in 2017. For each dividend period beginning in 2018, the dividend amount will be the entire amount of our net worth, if any, as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. As a 

result of these dividend payment provisions and quarterly directives from our conservator, when we have quarterly earnings that result in a net worth greater than the applicable capital reserve amount, we will pay dividends to Treasury in the next quarter; but if our net worth does not exceed the applicable capital reserve amount as of the end of a quarter, then we will not be required to accrue or pay any dividends in the next quarter. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks relating to our dividend obligations to Treasury on the senior preferred stock. 

The senior preferred stock ranks ahead of our common stock and all other outstanding series of our preferred stock, as well as any capital stock we issue in the future, as to both dividends and rights upon liquidation. The senior preferred stock provides that we may not, at any time, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any common stock or other securities ranking junior to the senior preferred stock unless (1) full cumulative dividends on the outstanding senior preferred stock (including any unpaid dividends added to the liquidation preference) have been declared and paid in cash, and (2) all amounts required to be paid with the net proceeds of any issuance of capital stock for cash (as described in the following paragraph) have been paid in cash. Shares of the senior preferred stock are not convertible. Shares of the senior preferred stock have no general or special voting rights, other than those set forth in the certificate of designation for the senior preferred stock or otherwise required by law. The consent of holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding shares of senior preferred stock is generally required to amend the terms of the senior preferred stock or to create any class or series of stock that ranks prior to or on parity with the senior preferred stock. 

We are not permitted to redeem the senior preferred stock prior to the termination of Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. Moreover, we are not permitted to pay down the liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of senior preferred stock except to the extent of (1) accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the liquidation preference and not previously paid down; and (2) quarterly commitment fees previously added to the liquidation preference and not previously paid down. In addition to these exceptions, if we issue any shares of capital stock for cash while the senior preferred stock is outstanding, the net proceeds of the issuance must be used to pay down the liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock; however, the liquidation preference of each share of senior preferred stock may not be paid down below $1,000 per share prior to the termination of Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment. Following the termination of Treasury&#8217;s funding commitment, we may pay down the liquidation preference of all outstanding shares of senior preferred stock at any time, in whole or in part. 

Common Stock Warrant 

Pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, on September 7, 2008, we, through FHFA, in its capacity as conservator, issued a warrant to purchase common stock to Treasury. The warrant gives Treasury the right to purchase shares of our common stock equal to 79.9% &#32;of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis on the date of exercise, for an exercise price of $0.00001 &#32;per share. The warrant may be exercised in whole or in part at any time on or before September 7, 2028. 

Covenants under Treasury Agreements 

The senior preferred stock purchase agreement and warrant contain covenants that significantly restrict our business activities and require the prior written consent of Treasury before we can take certain actions. These covenants prohibit us from taking a number of actions, including: 

&#8226; 

paying dividends or other distributions on or repurchasing our equity securities (other than the senior preferred stock or warrant); 

&#8226; 

issuing additional equity securities (except in limited instances); 

&#8226; 

selling, transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of any assets, except for dispositions for fair market value in limited circumstances including if (a) the transaction is in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice or (b) in one transaction or a series of related transactions if the assets have a fair market value individually or in the aggregate of less than $250 million ; 

&#8226; 

issuing subordinated debt; 

&#8226; 

entering into any new compensation arrangements or increasing amounts or benefits payable under existing compensation arrangements for any of our executive officers (as defined by SEC rules) without the consent of the Director of FHFA, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury; and 

&#8226; 

seeking or permitting the termination of our conservatorship, other than in connection with a receivership. 

We also are subject to limits, which are described below, on the amount of mortgage assets that we may own and the total amount of our indebtedness. As a result of these covenants, we can no longer obtain additional equity financing (other than pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement) and we are limited in the amount and type of debt financing we may obtain. 

&#8226; 

Mortgage Asset Limit. We are restricted in the amount of mortgage assets that we may own. Pursuant to the August 2012 amendment to the agreement, the maximum allowable amount of our mortgage assets was reduced to $650.0 billion &#32;on December 31, 2012 and, on each December 31 thereafter, we are required to reduce our mortgage assets to 85% of the maximum allowable amount that we were permitted to own as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, until the amount of our mortgage assets reaches $250 billion &#32;in 2018. Our mortgage asset limit under the agreement was $ 399.2 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 and will be $339.3 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2016. For purposes of the agreement, the definition of mortgage asset is based on the unpaid principal balance of such assets and does not reflect market valuation adjustments, allowance for loan losses, impairments, unamortized premiums and discounts and the impact of our consolidation of variable interest entities. Based on this definition, our mortgage assets were $345.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . We disclose the amount of our mortgage assets on a monthly basis under the caption &#8220;Gross Mortgage Portfolio&#8221; in our Monthly Summaries, which are available on our website and announced in a press release. 

In 2014, FHFA requested that we cap the portfolio each year at 90% of the annual limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury. FHFA&#8217;s request noted that we may seek FHFA permission to increase this cap up to 95% of the annual limit under our senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury upon written request and with a documented basis for exception, such as changed market conditions. To comply with FHFA&#8217;s request, we reduced our mortgage portfolio to $345.1 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015, below the $359.3 billion &#32; cap requested by FHFA. See &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Business Segment Results&#8212;The Capital Markets Group&#8217;s Mortgage Portfolio&#8221; for more information about our mortgage portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Debt Limit. We are subject to a limit on the amount of our indebtedness. Our debt limit in 2015 was $563.6 billion &#32;and in 2016 is $479.0 billion . For every year thereafter, our debt cap will equal 120% of the amount of mortgage assets we are allowed to own under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year. The definition of indebtedness for purposes of our debt cap is based on the par value of each applicable loan and does not reflect the impact of consolidation of variable interest entities. Under this definition, our indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was $389.5 billion . We disclose the amount of our indebtedness on a monthly basis under the caption &#8220;Total Debt Outstanding&#8221; in our Monthly Summaries, which are available on our website and announced in a press release. 

Annual Risk Management Plan Covenant. &#32;We are required to provide an annual risk management plan to Treasury not later than December 15 of each year we remain in conservatorship, beginning in 2012. Each annual risk management plan is required to set out our strategy for reducing our risk profile and to describe the actions we will take to reduce the financial and operational risk associated with each of our business segments. Each plan delivered after the first plan must include an assessment of our performance against the planned actions described in the prior year&#8217;s plan. We submitted our most recent annual risk management plan to Treasury in December 2015. 

Lawsuits Challenging the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements and Conservatorship 

Several lawsuits have been filed by preferred and common stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac against the United States, Treasury and/or FHFA challenging actions taken by the defendants relating to the senior preferred stock purchase agreements and the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Some of these lawsuits also contain claims against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For a description of these lawsuits, see &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220; Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies .&#8221; 

HOUSING FINANCE REFORM 

Overview 

Policymakers and others have focused significant attention in recent years on how to reform the nation&#8217;s housing finance system, including what role, if any, the GSEs should play. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which was signed into law in July 2010, called for enactment of meaningful structural reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and for the Secretary of the Treasury to submit recommendations to Congress for ending the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Administration Developments 

In 2011, the Administration released a white paper with its recommendations on the future of housing finance reform. The report provides that the Administration will work with FHFA to determine the best way to responsibly reduce Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#8217;s role in the market and ultimately wind down both institutions. The report identifies a number of possible policy steps for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, reducing the government&#8217;s role in housing finance and helping bring private capital back to the mortgage market. In addition, the report outlines three potential options for a new long-term structure for the housing finance system following the wind-down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

In 2013, President Obama publicly discussed the Administration&#8217;s housing policy priorities, including a core principle that included winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through a responsible transition. In 2015, the White House reaffirmed the Administration&#8217;s view that housing finance reform should include ending Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#8217;s business model. Moreover, to lay the groundwork for a future housing finance system, the Administration has advocated for credit risk on loans to be transferred by lenders prior to the acquisition of such loans by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (referred to as &#8220;front-end&#8221; risk transfer). The Administration has also advocated for the common securitization platform to be constructed to serve other market participants, not just Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Legislative Developments 

Congress also continues to consider housing finance reform that could result in significant changes in our structure and role in the future. In the first session of the 114th Congress, which convened in January 2015, several bills were introduced and considered in the Senate and the House of Representatives relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the housing finance system, two of which were enacted into law. In November 2015, legislation was enacted limiting the compensation of Fannie Mae&#8217;s and Freddie Mac&#8217;s chief executive officers. For a description of this law, see &#8220;Our Charter and Regulation of Our Activities&#8212;The GSE Act&#8212;Executive Compensation&#8221; and &#8220;Executive Compensation&#8212;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Impact of Conservatorship and Other Legal Requirements.&#8221; In December 2015, as part of a funding bill, Congress enacted a portion of the &#8220;Jumpstart GSE Reform Act&#8221; prohibiting Treasury from disposing of its Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac senior preferred stock until January 1, 2018, unless legislation is enacted that includes specific instruction for its disposition. 

Congress also introduced and considered other bills relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the housing finance system in 2015 that have not been enacted into law. For example, in May 2015, the Senate Banking Committee approved the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, which contains provisions that would, among other matters: 

&#8226; 

prevent the U.S. government from using increases in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guaranty fees to finance government spending, unless a law is enacted to do so and the funds are used to finance secondary mortgage market reforms; 

&#8226; 

prohibit Treasury from disposing of its Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac senior preferred stock unless Congress enacts a law directing it to do so; 

&#8226; 

establish requirements for CSS that include: expanding the CSS Board of Directors to include non-GSE representatives; transitioning ownership of CSS to a private, non-profit entity within five years; and facilitating the issuance of mortgage-backed securities by non-GSE issuers through its platform within three to five years; and 

&#8226; 

require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in significant and increasing credit risk sharing transactions, including front-end and first-loss transactions. 

We expect Congress to continue to consider legislation relating to the GSEs and housing finance reform in the current congressional session, including conducting hearings and considering legislation that would alter the housing finance system or the activities or operations of the GSEs. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks to our business relating to the uncertain future of our company, including how the uncertain future of our company may adversely affect our ability to retain and recruit well-qualified employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and senior management. 

Conservator Developments 

FHFA has taken a number of steps as conservator to further the reform of the housing finance system. FHFA&#8217;s current strategic goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac&#8217;s conservatorships are to: 

&#8226; 

Maintain , in a safe and sound manner, credit availability and foreclosure prevention activities for new and refinanced mortgages to foster liquid, efficient, competitive and resilient national housing finance markets. 

&#8226; 

Reduce &#32;taxpayer risk through increasing the role of private capital in the mortgage market. 

&#8226; 

Build &#32;a new single-family infrastructure for use by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and adaptable for use by other participants in the secondary market in the future. 

Beginning in 2012, FHFA has released annual corporate performance objectives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, referred to as the conservatorship scorecard, which detail specific priorities for implementing FHFA&#8217;s strategic goals. FHFA released its 2015 conservatorship scorecard in January 2015 and its 2016 conservatorship scorecard in December 2015. 

Both FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards include objectives relating to the development of a common securitization platform that can be used to perform certain aspects of the securitization process and the development of a single mortgage-backed security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA&#8217;s 2016 conservatorship scorecard states that the common securitization platform and single security are significant multi-year initiatives and FHFA expects these inter-related projects to remain ongoing conservatorship priorities. The 2016 conservatorship scorecard states that FHFA expects both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to implement the single security on the common securitization platform in 2018. More information on each of these initiatives is provided below. 

Common Securitization Platform. In October 2013, at the direction of our conservator, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established Common Securitization Solutions, LLC, a jointly owned limited liability company formed to design, develop, build and ultimately operate a common securitization platform. The intended purpose of the common securitization platform is to replace certain elements of Fannie Mae&#8217;s and Freddie Mac&#8217;s respective proprietary systems for securitizing mortgages and performing associated back office and administrative functions. In addition, FHFA&#8217;s 2015 and 2016 conservatorship scorecards specify that the design of the common securitization platform should allow for the integration of additional market participants in the future. 

In 2014, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executed three agreements relating to the governance and operation of CSS, and appointed a chief executive officer and four members of the CSS Board of Managers, two each from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac currently provide administrative support services, funding and other resources to CSS. CSS is implementing key corporate processes to enable it to eventually operate as a separate company. 

We continue to work with FHFA, Freddie Mac and CSS on building and testing the common securitization platform, as well as on implementing required changes to our systems and operations to integrate with the common securitization platform. In July 2015, we, Freddie Mac and CSS announced the creation of an industry advisory group to provide feedback and share information on efforts to build the common securitization platform and implement the single security. In September 2015, FHFA issued &#8220;An Update on the Common Securitization Platform,&#8221; which provided details on the progress made in developing the platform. 

Single GSE Security. &#32;FHFA&#8217;s 2014 Strategic Plan for the Conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac includes the goal of developing a single mortgage-backed security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In August 2014, FHFA published a request for public input on a proposed structure for this single security. After reviewing and considering the responses received, FHFA issued an update on the structure of the single security in May 2015 that outlined its determinations regarding the key features of the single security structure and requested further feedback on its determinations. FHFA&#8217;s determinations included the following: 

&#8226; 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will each issue and guarantee single securities directly backed by mortgage loans it has acquired, referred to as first-level securities, and will not cross-guarantee each other&#8217;s first-level securities; 

&#8226; 

mortgage loans backing first-level single securities will be limited to fixed-rate mortgage loans now eligible for financing through the &#8220;To-Be-Announced&#8221; (&#8220;TBA&#8221;) market; 

&#8226; 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will each be able to issue second-level single securities, also referred to as resecuritizations, backed by first- or second-level securities issued by either company; 

&#8226; 

the key features of the new single security will be the same as those of the current Fannie Mae MBS; 

&#8226; 

the loan- and security-level disclosures for single securities will closely resemble those of Freddie Mac participation certificates (&#8220;PCs&#8221;); and 

&#8226; 

investors in Freddie Mac PCs will have the option to exchange legacy PCs for comparable single securities backed by the same mortgage loans; there will not be an exchange option for legacy Fannie Mae MBS because FHFA expects investors to treat them as fungible with the single securities. 

In 2015, we, FHFA and Freddie Mac developed a plan to implement the single security and worked on a variety of issues relating to the implementation of the single security, including accounting matters, communication planning, industry outreach, risk assessments, privacy matters, legal and contractual issues, and disclosures. 

One of FHFA&#8217;s stated objectives in developing a single security is to reduce the costs to Freddie Mac and taxpayers that result from the difference in liquidity of Fannie Mae MBS and Freddie Mac PCs. We believe the implementation of a single security would likely reduce, and could eliminate, the trading advantage that Fannie Mae MBS have over Freddie Mac PCs. If this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial results. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of the risks to our business associated with a single security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

OUR CHARTER AND REGULATION OF OUR ACTIVITIES 

Charter Act 

Fannie Mae is a shareholder-owned corporation organized and existing under the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, which we refer to as the Charter Act or our charter. The Charter Act sets forth the activities that we are permitted to conduct, authorizes us to issue debt and equity securities, and describes our general corporate powers. The Charter Act also defines our mission of providing liquidity, increasing stability and promoting affordability in the residential mortgage market. Specifically, the Charter Act states that our purposes are to: 

&#8226; 

provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages; 

&#8226; 

respond appropriately to the private capital market; 

&#8226; 

provide ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages (including activities relating to mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families involving a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing; and 

&#8226; 

promote access to mortgage credit throughout the nation (including central cities, rural areas and underserved areas) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing. 

Loan Standards 

Our charter permits us to purchase and securitize mortgage loans secured by either a single-family or multifamily property. Mortgage loans we purchase or securitize must meet the following standards required by the Charter Act. 

&#8226; 

Principal Balance Limitations. Single-family conventional mortgage loans that we purchase or securitize are subject to maximum original principal balance limits, known as &#8220;conforming loan limits.&#8221; The conforming loan limits are established each year based on the average prices of one-family residences. Since 2006, the national conforming loan limit for mortgages that finance one-family residences has been set at $417,000 , with higher limits for mortgages secured by two- to four-family residences and in four statutorily-designated states and territories (Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Higher loan limits also apply in designated high-cost areas (counties or county-equivalent areas). FHFA provides Fannie Mae with the designated high-cost areas annually. Our charter sets loan limits for high-cost areas up to 150% &#32;of the national loan limit ( $625,500 &#32;for a one-family residence; higher for two- to four-family residences and in the four statutorily-designated states and territories). 

The Charter Act does not impose maximum original principal balance limits on loans we purchase or securitize that are insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA or on multifamily mortgage loans that we purchase or securitize. 

&#8226; 

Loan-to-Value and Credit Enhancement Requirements. The Charter Act generally requires credit enhancement on any single-family conventional mortgage loan that we purchase or securitize that has an LTV ratio over 80% &#32;at the time of purchase. Although we do not currently purchase or securitize second lien single-family mortgage loans, the Charter Act requires a second lien mortgage loan to have credit enhancement if the combined LTV ratio exceeds 80% . The credit enhancement required by our charter may take the form of one or more of the following: (1) insurance or a guaranty by a qualified insurer on the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage that exceeds 80% ; (2) a seller&#8217;s agreement to repurchase or replace the mortgage in the event of default; or (3) retention by the seller of at least a 10% &#32;participation interest in the mortgage. Regardless of LTV ratio, the Charter Act does not require us to obtain credit enhancement to purchase or securitize loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA. In addition, under HARP and in accordance with FHFA direction, we allow our borrowers who have mortgage loans that have note dates prior to 

June 2009 with current LTV ratios greater than 80% to refinance their mortgages without obtaining new mortgage insurance in excess of what is already in place. 

Other Charter Act Provisions 

The Charter Act has the following additional provisions. 

&#8226; 

Issuances of Our Securities. We are authorized, upon the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue debt obligations and mortgage-related securities. Neither the U.S. government nor any of its agencies guarantees, directly or indirectly, our debt or mortgage-related securities. 

&#8226; 

Authority of Treasury to Purchase Our Securities. &#32;At the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, Treasury may purchase our obligations up to a maximum of $2.25 billion &#32;outstanding at any one time. 

&#8226; 

Exemptions for Our Securities. The Charter Act generally provides that our securities are exempt under the federal securities laws administered by the SEC. As a result, we are not required to file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to offerings of any of our securities. Our non-equity securities are also exempt securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). However, our equity securities are not treated as exempt securities for purposes of Sections 12, 13, 14 or 16 of the Exchange Act. Consequently, we are required to file periodic and current reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. 

&#8226; 

Exemption from Specified Taxes. Fannie Mae is exempt from taxation by states, territories, counties, municipalities and local taxing authorities, except for taxation by those authorities on our real property. We are not exempt from the payment of federal corporate income taxes. 

&#8226; 

Limitations. We may not originate mortgage loans or advance funds to a mortgage seller on an interim basis, using mortgage loans as collateral, pending the sale of the mortgages in the secondary market. In addition, we may only purchase or securitize mortgages on properties located in the United States and its territories. 

The GSE Act 

As a federally chartered corporation, we are subject to government regulation and oversight. FHFA is an independent agency of the federal government with general supervisory and regulatory authority over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLBs&#8221;). FHFA was established in July 2008, assuming the duties of our former safety and soundness regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, and our former mission regulator, HUD. HUD remains our regulator with respect to fair lending matters. Our regulators also include the SEC and Treasury. 

The GSE Act provides FHFA with safety and soundness authority that is comparable to and in some respects broader than that of the federal banking agencies. Even if we were not in conservatorship, the GSE Act gives FHFA the authority to raise capital levels above statutory minimum levels, regulate the size and content of our portfolio and approve new mortgage products, among other things. 

Capital. The GSE Act provides FHFA with broad authority to increase the level of our required minimum capital and to establish capital or reserve requirements for specific products and activities. FHFA also has broad authority to establish risk-based capital requirements, to ensure that we operate in a safe and sound manner and maintain sufficient capital and reserves. During the conservatorship, FHFA has suspended our capital classifications. We continue to submit capital reports to FHFA and FHFA monitors our capital levels. We describe our capital requirements below under &#8220;Capital Adequacy Requirements.&#8221; 

Portfolio. The GSE Act requires FHFA to establish standards governing our portfolio holdings, to ensure that they are backed by sufficient capital and consistent with our mission and safe and sound operations. FHFA is also required to monitor our portfolio and, in some circumstances, may require us to dispose of or acquire assets. In 2010, FHFA adopted, as the standard for our portfolio holdings, the portfolio limits specified in the senior preferred stock purchase agreement described under &#8220;Conservatorship and Treasury Agreements&#8212;Treasury Agreements&#8212;Covenants under Treasury Agreements,&#8221; as it may be amended from time to time. The rule is effective for as long as we remain subject to the terms and obligations of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement. 

New Products and Activities. The GSE Act requires us to request FHFA&#8217;s approval before initially offering any new product, subject to certain exceptions. The GSE Act also requires us to provide FHFA with written notice before commencing any new activity. In July 2009, FHFA published an interim final rule implementing these provisions of the GSE Act. Subsequently, the then-Acting Director of FHFA concluded that permitting us to engage in new products was inconsistent with the goals of the conservatorship. FHFA therefore instructed us not to submit new product requests under the rule. In December 2015, FHFA stated in the preamble to its proposed rule on the duty to serve underserved markets that we may propose a new product or 

activity for FHFA&#8217;s consideration if we determine that it would facilitate our duty to serve obligations and would be consistent with safety and soundness. 

Receivership. Under the GSE Act, FHFA must place us into receivership if it determines that our assets are less than our obligations for 60 days, or we have not been paying our debts as they become due for 60 days. FHFA has notified us that the measurement period for any mandatory receivership determination with respect to our assets and liabilities would commence no earlier than the SEC public filing deadline for our quarterly or annual financial statements and would continue for 60 calendar days thereafter. FHFA has advised us that if, during that 60-day period, we receive funds from Treasury in an amount at least equal to the deficiency amount under the senior preferred stock purchase agreement, the Director of FHFA will not make a mandatory receivership determination. 

In addition, we could be put into receivership at the discretion of the Director of FHFA at any time for other reasons set forth in the GSE Act. The statutory grounds for discretionary appointment of a receiver include: a substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to unsafe or unsound practices; the existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; an inability to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business; a weakening of our condition due to unsafe or unsound practices or conditions; critical undercapitalization; undercapitalization and no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized; the likelihood of losses that will deplete substantially all of our capital; or by consent. 

FHFA&#8217;s final rule on conservatorship and receivership operations for the GSEs, which became effective in July 2011, implements and supplements the procedures and processes set forth in the GSE Act. For example, the final rule clarifies that: 

&#8226; 

the powers of the conservator or receiver include continuing our mission and ensuring that our operations foster liquid, efficient, competitive and resilient national housing finance markets; 

&#8226; 

we are prohibited from making capital distributions while in conservatorship unless authorized by the Director of FHFA; and 

&#8226; 

claims by current or former shareholders (including securities litigation claims) would receive the lowest priority in a receivership. 

The rule also provides that FHFA, as conservator, will not pay securities litigation claims against us during conservatorship, unless the Director of FHFA determines it to be in the interest of the conservatorship. 

Prudential Management and Operations Standards. As required by the GSE Act, in June 2012, FHFA published a final rule establishing prudential standards relating to the management and operations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHLBs in ten areas: (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) independence and adequacy of internal audit systems; (3) management of market risk exposure; (4) management of market risk&#8212;measurement systems, risk limits, stress testing, and monitoring and reporting; (5) adequacy and maintenance of liquidity and reserves; (6) management of asset and investment portfolio growth; (7) investments and acquisitions of assets; (8) overall risk management processes; (9) management of credit and counterparty risk; and (10) maintenance of adequate records. The rule also includes provisions addressing the general responsibilities of boards of directors and senior management. In November 2015, FHFA amended these provisions and designated them as an additional prudential standard in order to clarify that they have the same effect and can be enforced in the same manner as the ten enumerated standards. 

Affordable Housing Goals and Duty to Serve. We discuss our affordable housing goals and our duty to serve underserved markets below under &#8220;Housing Goals and Duty to Serve Underserved Markets.&#8221; 

Affordable Housing Allocations. &#32;The GSE Act requires us to set aside in each fiscal year an amount equal to 4.2 basis points for each dollar of the unpaid principal balance of our total new business purchases and to pay this amount to specified HUD and Treasury funds. FHFA suspended this requirement in November 2008 and directed us to not set aside or allocate funds until further notice. In December 2014, FHFA terminated this suspension and directed us to begin making contributions to the funds. FHFA&#8217;s directive reinstating these contributions requires us to set aside amounts during each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 2015, and to allocate or otherwise transfer the amounts set aside within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year, unless during such fiscal year we have made a draw from Treasury under the terms of the senior preferred stock purchase agreement or unless such allocation or transfer would cause us to have to make a draw from Treasury under the agreement, in which case we will make no allocation or transfer for that year and the amounts set aside for that year will be reversed. We are prohibited from redirecting or passing through the cost of these allocations to originators of mortgages that we purchase or securitize. Pursuant to FHFA&#8217;s directive, we expect to make our first payment of $217 million &#32;to the funds on or before February 29, 2016, based on the amount of our new business purchases in 2015. 

Executive Compensation. Fannie Mae&#8217;s Charter provides that the company has the power to pay compensation to our executives that the Board of Directors determines is reasonable and comparable with the compensation of executives performing similar duties in similar businesses, except that a significant portion of potential compensation must be based on 

our performance. The GSE Act directs FHFA to prohibit us from providing unreasonable or non-comparable compensation to our executive officers. FHFA may at any time review the reasonableness and comparability of an executive officer&#8217;s compensation and may require us to withhold any payment to the officer during such review. In addition, pursuant to the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (the &#8220;STOCK Act&#8221;) and related regulations issued by FHFA, our senior executives are prohibited from receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship on or after April 4, 2012. 

FHFA is authorized by the GSE Act to prohibit or limit certain golden parachute and indemnification payments to directors, officers and certain other parties. FHFA regulation requires the approval of the Director of FHFA before we may enter into any agreement providing compensation in connection with the termination of an executive officer&#8217;s employment. FHFA regulation also generally prohibits us from making golden parachute payments to any current or former director, officer, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of the company during any period in which we are in conservatorship, receivership or other troubled condition unless either a specific exception applies or the Director of FHFA approves the payments. 

In November 2015, the Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2015 was enacted. This law directs the Director of FHFA to suspend the compensation packages approved for 2015 for Fannie Mae&#8217;s and Freddie Mac&#8217;s chief executive officers and, in lieu of such packages, to establish the compensation and benefits that were in effect for such officers as of January 1, 2015. The law also provides that these officers&#8217; compensation and benefits may not thereafter be increased and these restrictions on chief executive officer compensation are applicable as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in conservatorship or receivership. In accordance with this law, on December 1, 2015, the Director of FHFA directed Fannie Mae to decrease the total target annual direct compensation of our chief executive officer to $600,000, effective November 25, 2015. For more information on our executive compensation program and regulatory and other legal requirements affecting our executive compensation, see &#8220;Executive Compensation.&#8221; 

Fair Lending. The GSE Act requires the Secretary of HUD to assure that the GSEs meet their fair lending obligations. Among other things, HUD periodically reviews and comments on our underwriting and appraisal guidelines to ensure consistency with the Fair Housing Act. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

The GSE Act establishes capital adequacy requirements. The statutory capital framework incorporates two different quantitative assessments of capital&#8212;a minimum capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement. The minimum capital requirement is ratio-based, while the risk-based capital requirement is based on simulated stress test performance. The GSE Act requires us to maintain sufficient capital to meet both of these requirements in order to be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; However, during the conservatorship, FHFA has suspended our capital classifications and announced that our existing statutory and FHFA-directed regulatory capital requirements will not be binding. FHFA has advised us that, because we are under conservatorship, we will not be subject to corrective action requirements that would ordinarily result from our receiving a capital classification of &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; 

Minimum Capital. Under the GSE Act, we are required to maintain an amount of core capital that equals or exceeds our minimum capital requirement. The GSE Act defines core capital as the sum of the stated value of outstanding common stock (common stock less treasury stock), the stated value of outstanding non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our minimum capital requirement is generally equal to the sum of 2.50% &#32;of on-balance sheet assets and 0.45% &#32;of off-balance sheet obligations. For purposes of minimum capital, FHFA has directed us to continue reporting loans backing Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties based on 0.45% &#32;of the unpaid principal balance regardless of whether these loans have been consolidated pursuant to accounting rules. FHFA retains authority under the GSE Act to raise the minimum capital requirement for any of our assets or activities. 

Risk-Based Capital. The GSE Act requires FHFA to establish risk-based capital requirements for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to ensure that we operate in a safe and sound manner. Existing risk-based capital regulation under the GSE Act ties our capital requirements to the risk in our book of business, as measured by a stress test model. The stress test simulates our financial performance over a ten-year period of severe economic conditions characterized by both extreme interest rate movements and high mortgage default rates. FHFA has stated that it does not intend to publish our risk-based capital level during the conservatorship and has discontinued stress test simulations under the existing rule. We continue to submit detailed profiles of our books of business to FHFA to support FHFA&#8217;s monitoring of our business activity and their research into future risk-based capital rules. In addition, as described under &#8220;The Dodd-Frank Act&#8212;Stress Testing&#8221; below, we submit stress test simulations to FHFA pursuant to regulations FHFA implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Critical Capital. The GSE Act also establishes a critical capital requirement, which is the amount of core capital below which we would be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Under the GSE Act, such classification is a discretionary ground for appointing a conservator or receiver. Our critical capital requirement is generally equal to the sum of 1.25% &#32;of on-balance 

sheet assets and 0.25% &#32;of off-balance sheet obligations. FHFA has directed us, for purposes of critical capital, to continue reporting loans backing Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties based on 0.25% &#32;of the unpaid principal balance, notwithstanding our consolidation of substantially all of the loans backing these securities. FHFA has stated that it does not intend to publish our critical capital level during the conservatorship. 

Housing Goals and Duty to Serve Underserved Markets 

We describe below our housing goals that were in place for 2012 to 2014, our performance against those goals in 2014, as well as our new housing goals for 2015 to 2017. We also discuss our duty to serve specified underserved markets. 

Housing Goals for 2012 to 2014 

In November 2012, FHFA published a final rule establishing the following single-family home purchase and refinance housing goal benchmarks for 2012 to 2014 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A home purchase mortgage may be counted toward more than one home purchase benchmark. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Families Home Purchase Benchmark : At least 23% &#32;of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans were required to be affordable to low-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 80% &#32;of area median income). 

&#8226; 

Very Low-Income Families Home Purchase Benchmark : At least 7% &#32;of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans were required to be affordable to very low-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 50% &#32;of area median income). 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Areas Home Purchase Goal Benchmark : &#32; The benchmark level for our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans for families in low-income areas was set annually by notice from FHFA, based on the benchmark level for the low-income areas home purchase subgoal (below), plus an adjustment factor reflecting the additional incremental share of mortgages for moderate-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 100% &#32;of area median income) in designated disaster areas. For 2014, FHFA set the overall low-income areas home purchase benchmark goal at 18%. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Areas Home Purchase Subgoal Benchmark : &#32; At least 11% &#32;of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans were required to be affordable to families in low-income census tracts or to moderate-income families in high-minority census tracts. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Families Refinancing Benchmark : At least 20% &#32;of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied refinance mortgage loans were required to be affordable to low-income families. 

If we did not meet these benchmarks, we could still meet our goals. Our single-family housing goals performance was measured against benchmarks and against goals-qualifying originations in the primary mortgage market after the release of data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (&#8220;HMDA&#8221;), which is typically released each year in the fall. We would be in compliance with the housing goals if we met either the benchmarks or market share measures. 

To meet FHFA&#8217;s multifamily housing goals for 2012 to 2014, our multifamily business was required to finance a certain number of units affordable to low-income families and a certain number of units affordable to very low-income families. The specific requirements for each year are set forth in Table 5 &#32;below. There was no market-based alternative measurement for the multifamily goals .

Our single-family results and benchmarks are expressed as a percentage of the total number of eligible mortgages acquired during the period. 

Housing Goals for 2015 to 2017 

In September 2015, FHFA published a final rule establishing single-family and multifamily housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for 2015 to 2017. 

Single-Family Housing Goals 

FHFA adopted the following single-family home purchase and refinance housing goal benchmarks for 2015 to 2017. A home purchase mortgage may be counted toward more than one home purchase benchmark. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Families Home Purchase Benchmark : At least 24% of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans must be affordable to low-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 80% of area median income). This is an increase from the 23% benchmark that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Very Low-Income Families Home Purchase Benchmark : At least 6% of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans must be affordable to very low-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 50% of area median income). This is a decrease from the 7% benchmark that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Areas Home Purchase Goal Benchmark : The benchmark level for our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans for families in low-income areas is set annually by notice from FHFA, based on the benchmark level for the low-income areas home purchase subgoal (below), plus an adjustment factor reflecting the additional incremental share of mortgages for moderate-income families (defined as income equal to or less than 100% of area median income) in designated disaster areas. For 2015, FHFA set the overall low-income areas home purchase benchmark goal at 19%. This is an increase from the 18% benchmark that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Areas Home Purchase Subgoal Benchmark : At least 14% of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied purchase money mortgage loans must be affordable to families in low-income census tracts or to moderate-income families in high-minority census tracts. This is an increase from the benchmark of 11% that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Families Refinancing Benchmark : At least 21% of our acquisitions of single-family owner-occupied refinance mortgage loans must be affordable to low-income families. This is an increase from the benchmark of 20% that applied for 2014. 

Under the rule, not all of our single-family loan acquisitions that fall within these categories may be counted towards our housing goals. Certain types of loan acquisitions are excluded, such as single-family government loans and loans for single-family rental properties. In addition, only permanent modifications of mortgages under the Administration&#8217;s Home 

Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP &#174; &#8221;) completed during the year count towards our housing goals; trial modifications are not counted. Moreover, these modifications count only towards our single-family low-income families refinance goal, not any of the home purchase goals. Refinancings under HARP also count toward our single-family low-income families refinancing goal. 

If we do not meet these benchmarks, we may still meet our goals. Our single-family housing goals performance is measured against both these benchmarks and against goals-qualifying originations in the primary mortgage market after the release of HMDA data, which is typically released each year in the fall. We will be in compliance with the housing goals if we meet either the benchmarks or market share measures. 

Multifamily Housing Goals 

FHFA&#8217;s final rule also includes a multifamily special affordable housing goal and subgoal, and establishes a new subgoal for small multifamily properties (defined as those with 5 to 50 units) affordable to low-income families. FHFA&#8217;s annual multifamily goals and subgoals for 2015 to 2017 are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Low-Income Families Goal : At least 300,000 multifamily units per year must be affordable to low-income families. This is an increase from the goal of 250,000 units that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Very Low-Income Families Subgoal : At least 60,000 multifamily units per year must be affordable to very low-income families. This is the same subgoal that applied for 2014. 

&#8226; 

Small Affordable Multifamily Properties Subgoal : FHFA established a new subgoal for purchases of mortgages on small multifamily properties affordable to low-income families. The subgoal increases each year: 6,000 units in 2015; 8,000 units in 2016; and 10,000 units in 2017. 

There is no market-based alternative measurement for the multifamily goal or subgoals. 

We will report our performance with respect to the 2015 housing goals in March 2016. FHFA will issue a final determination on our performance after the release of data reported under HMDA later this year. 

If we do not meet our housing goals, FHFA determines whether the goals were feasible. If FHFA finds that our goals were feasible, we may become subject to a housing plan that could require us to take additional steps that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The housing plan must describe the actions we would take to meet the goal in the next calendar year and be approved by FHFA. The potential penalties for failure to comply with housing plan requirements include a cease-and-desist order and civil money penalties. 

Duty to Serve 

The 2008 Reform Act created the duty to serve underserved markets in order for us and Freddie Mac to &#8220;provide leadership to the market in developing loan products and flexible underwriting guidelines to facilitate a secondary market for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families&#8221; in three underserved markets: manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation and rural areas. 

In December 2015, FHFA published a proposed rule to implement our duty to serve. Under the proposed rule, each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be required to adopt an underserved markets plan covering a three-year period that sets forth the activities and objectives we will undertake to meet our duty to serve the specified underserved markets. The development of these plans would be subject to a public notice and comment process and the plans would require FHFA&#8217;s approval before being adopted. For the manufactured housing market, duty to serve credit would be provided for eligible activities relating to manufactured homes financed as real property and blanket loans for specified categories of manufactured housing communities. For the affordable housing preservation market, duty to serve credit would be provided for eligible activities relating to preserving the affordability of housing for renters and buyers under specified programs enumerated in the GSE Act and other comparable affordable housing programs administered by state and local governments, subject to FHFA approval. Duty to serve credit would also be provided for activities related to existing small (5 to 50 units) multifamily rental properties, energy efficiency improvements on existing multifamily rental and single-family first lien properties, certain shared equity homeownership programs and HUD&#8217;s Choice Neighborhoods Initiative and Rental Assistance Demonstration program. For the rural market, duty to serve credit would be provided for eligible activities related to housing in rural areas, including activities serving specified high-needs rural regions and populations. FHFA could also approve duty to serve credit for additional activities identified in our underserved markets plan. Qualifying activities that promote residential economic diversity in one or more underserved markets would also receive duty to serve credit. Under the proposed rule, FHFA would evaluate and rate our performance under our underserved markets plan on an annual basis, and report the results to Congress. If FHFA determines that we failed to meet the requirements of our underserved markets plan and that it was feasible to do so, it may result in the imposition of a housing plan. 

As described in &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; actions we may take to meet our housing goals and duty to serve requirements may increase our credit losses and credit-related expense. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the regulation of the financial services industry, including requiring new standards related to regulatory oversight of systemically important nonbank financial companies, derivatives transactions, asset-backed securitization, mortgage underwriting and consumer financial protection. The Dodd-Frank Act has directly affected and will continue to affect our business through new and expanded regulatory oversight and standards applicable to us. We are also indirectly affected by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations that impact the activities of our customers and counterparties in the financial services industry. We discuss the potential risks to our business resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act in &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; Below we summarize some key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as some rules that have been promulgated by various government agencies to implement provisions of the legislation. 

Enhanced supervision and prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the &#8220;FSOC&#8221;), chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, to ensure that all financial companies&#8212;not just banks&#8212;whose failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States will be subject to strong oversight. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FSOC is responsible for designating systemically important nonbank financial companies, while the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is responsible for establishing enhanced prudential standards that will apply to FSOC-designated systemically important nonbank financial companies, as well as to large bank holding companies. Depending on the scope and final form of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s enhanced standards, and the extent to which they apply to us if we are designated as a systemically important nonbank financial company, or to our customers and other counterparties, their adoption and application could increase our costs, pose operational challenges and adversely affect demand for Fannie Mae debt and MBS. To date, we have received no notification of possible designation as a systemically important nonbank financial company. 

Swap Transactions; Minimum Capital and Margin Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions requiring additional regulation of swap transactions. Because we are a user of interest rate swaps, the Dodd-Frank Act requires us, among other items, to submit new swap transactions for clearing to a derivatives clearing organization. Additionally, in October 2015, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), FHFA, the Farm Credit Administration and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a new final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act governing margin and capital requirements applicable to entities that are subject to their oversight. As this rule is phased in, it will require that, for trades that have not been submitted to a derivatives clearing organization, we collect from and provide to our counterparties collateral in excess of the amounts we have historically collected or provided relative to our level of activity. 

Ability to Repay. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;) to require creditors to determine that borrowers have a &#8220;reasonable ability to repay&#8221; most mortgage loans prior to making such loans. In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) issued a final rule under Regulation Z that, among others things, requires creditors to determine a borrower&#8217;s &#8220;ability to repay&#8221; a mortgage loan. If a creditor fails to comply, a borrower may be able to offset a portion of the amount owed in a foreclosure proceeding or recoup monetary damages. The rule offers several options for complying with the ability to repay requirement, including making loans that meet certain terms and characteristics (so-called &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221;), which may provide creditors and their assignees with special protection from liability. Generally, a loan will be a qualified mortgage under the rule if, among other things, (1) the points and fees paid in connection with the loan do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount, (2) the loan term does not exceed 30 years, (3) the loan is fully amortizing with no negative amortization, interest-only or balloon features and (4) the debt-to-income ratio on the loan does not exceed 43% at origination. The CFPB also defined a special class of conventional mortgage loans that will be qualified mortgages if they (1) meet the points and fees, term and amortization requirements of qualified mortgages generally and (2) are eligible for sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This class of qualified mortgages expires on the earlier of January 10, 2021 or when the GSEs cease to be in conservatorship or receivership. 

In May 2013, FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to limit our acquisition of single-family loans to those loans that meet the points and fees, term and amortization requirements for qualified mortgages, or to loans that are exempt from the ability-to-repay rule, such as loans made to investors. This limitation applies to loans with application dates on or after January 10, 2014, the effective date of the ability-to-repay rule. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of these changes on our business. 

Risk Retention. The Dodd-Frank Act requires financial regulators to jointly prescribe regulations requiring securitizers to retain a portion of the credit risk in assets transferred, sold or conveyed through the issuance of asset-backed securities, with certain exceptions. In October 2014, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System, the FDIC, the SEC, FHFA and HUD issued a final rule implementing this credit risk retention requirement. The final rule generally requires securitizers to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets they securitize. The rule offers several compliance options, one of which is to have either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (so long as they are in conservatorship or receivership) securitize and fully guarantee the assets, in which case no further retention of credit risk is required. In addition, securities backed solely by mortgage loans meeting the definition of a &#8220;qualified residential mortgage&#8221; are exempt from the risk retention requirements of the rule. The rule defines &#8220;qualified residential mortgage&#8221; to have the same meaning as the term &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB in connection with its &#8220;ability to repay&#8221; rule under Regulation Z discussed above. The final risk retention rule became effective on December 24, 2015 for single-family mortgage loans and will become effective on December 24, 2016 for multifamily mortgage loans. We do not expect any significant changes in our current business practices as a result of the risk retention rule. 

TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (&#8220;TRID&#8221;) . The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFPB to streamline and simplify the disclosures required under TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;). In October 2015, the CFPB&#8217;s final rule implementing these changes went into effect. Although this rule applies to mortgage originators and is not directly applicable to us, we could face potential liability for certain errors in the new required disclosures in connection with the loans we acquire from lenders. At this time, it is not yet clear what sorts of errors will give rise to liability. Also in October 2015, FHFA directed us and Freddie Mac not to conduct post-purchase loan file reviews for technical compliance with TRID. Consistent with FHFA&#8217;s directive, we currently do not intend to exercise our contractual remedies, including requiring the lender to repurchase the loan, for noncompliance with the newly applicable provisions of TRID, except in two limited circumstances: if the required form is not used; or if a particular practice would impair enforcement of the note or mortgage or would result in assignee liability, and a court of law, regulator or other authoritative body has determined that such practice violates TRID. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of this rule on our business. 

Stress Testing. The Dodd-Frank Act requires certain financial companies to conduct annual stress tests to determine whether the companies have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. In September 2013, FHFA issued a final rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s stress test requirements for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHLBs. Under the rule, each year we are required to conduct a stress test using three different scenarios of financial conditions provided by FHFA: baseline, adverse and severely adverse. In conducting the stress test, we are required to calculate the impact of the scenario conditions on our capital levels and other specified measures of financial condition and performance over a period of at least nine quarters. The rule requires us to submit the stress test results for the three scenarios to FHFA and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, as well as to publish the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario by a later date. We submitted our most recent stress test results under this rule to FHFA and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on February 5, 2015 and published our most recent stress test results for the severely adverse scenario on our website on April 30, 2015. 

In November 2015, FHFA amended this stress testing rule to change certain dates associated with the process. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, FHFA&#8217;s amendment changed the following: the start date of the stress test cycles changed from October 1 to January 1; the date by which we are required to report our stress test results to FHFA and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors changed from February 5 to May 20; and the date by which we are required to publicly disclose a summary of the stress test results for the severely adverse scenario changed from between April 15 and April 30, to between August 1 and August 15. 

Bank Capital and Liquidity Standards 

Although we are not subject to banking regulations, our business may be affected by changes to the capital and liquidity requirements applicable to U.S. banks. The capital and liquidity regimes for the U.S. banking industry are currently undergoing significant changes as a result of actions by international bank regulators. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a set of revisions to the international capital requirements. These revisions, known as Basel III, generally narrow the definition of capital that can be used to meet risk-based standards and raise the amount of capital that must be held. Basel III also introduces new quantitative liquidity requirements. In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final regulation implementing Basel III&#8217;s capital standards. In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators also issued a final regulation setting minimum liquidity standards for large U.S. banks generally in accordance with Basel III standards. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of how changing regulations applicable to U.S. banks could materially adversely affect demand by banks for our debt and MBS securities in the future. 

OUR CUSTOMERS 

Our principal customers are lenders that operate within the primary mortgage market where mortgage loans are originated and funds are loaned to borrowers. Our customers include mortgage banking companies, savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks, credit unions, community banks, specialty servicers, insurance companies, and state and local housing finance agencies. Lenders originating mortgages in the primary mortgage market often sell them in the secondary mortgage market in the form of whole loans or in the form of mortgage-related securities. 

We have a diversified funding base of domestic and international investors. Purchasers of Fannie Mae MBS or Fannie Mae debt securities include fund managers, commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies, Treasury, foreign central banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other municipal authorities. 

During 2015 , approximately 1,200 &#32;lenders delivered single-family mortgage loans to us, either for securitization or for purchase. We acquire a significant portion of our single-family mortgage loans from several large mortgage lenders. During 2015 , our top five lender customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 29% &#32;of our single-family business volume, down from approximately 33% &#32;in 2014 . Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., together with its affiliates, was the only customer that accounted for 10% or more of our single-family business volume in 2015 , with approximately 13% . 

A number of factors impacted our customers in 2015 &#32;and affected the volume of business and mix of customers with whom we and our competitors do business. We obtained a smaller portion of our single-family loan acquisitions from large mortgage lenders in the last several years than in prior years as a result of a reduction in the aggregation of third-party mortgage originations among large mortgage originators and other factors. At the same time, we sought and continue to seek to provide liquidity to a broader, more diverse set of mortgage lenders. In addition to the decrease in single-family mortgage seller concentration, in recent years, we have acquired a large portion of our business volume from non-depository sellers. Doing more business with a more diverse set of mortgage lenders has lowered to a degree the significant exposure concentration we have built up with a few large institutions. However, the potentially lower financial strength, liquidity and operational capacity of many of these smaller or non-depository mortgage sellers and servicers compared with larger, depository financial institutions may negatively affect their ability to satisfy their repurchase or compensatory fee obligations or to service the loans on our behalf. 

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for a discussion of risks relating to our institutional counterparties and our acquisition of a significant portion of our mortgage loans from several large mortgage lenders. 

COMPETITION 

We compete to acquire mortgage assets in the secondary market. We also compete for the issuance of mortgage-related securities to investors. Competition in these areas is affected by many factors, including the number of residential mortgage loans offered for sale in the secondary market by loan originators and other market participants, the nature of the residential mortgage loans offered for sale (for example, whether the loans represent refinancings), the current demand for mortgage assets from mortgage investors, the interest rate risk investors are willing to assume and the yields they will require as a result, and the credit risk and prices associated with available mortgage investments. 

Competition to acquire mortgage assets is significantly affected by both our and our competitors&#8217; pricing and eligibility standards, as well as investor demand for our and our competitors&#8217; mortgage-related securities. Our competitive environment also may be affected by many other factors, such as new legislation or regulations. See &#8220;Housing Finance Reform,&#8221; &#8220;Our Charter and Regulation of Our Activities&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for information on legislation and regulations that could affect our business and competitive environment. 

Our competitors for the acquisition of single-family mortgage assets are financial institutions and government agencies that manage residential mortgage credit risk or invest in residential mortgage loans, including Freddie Mac, FHA, the VA, Ginnie Mae (which primarily guarantees securities backed by FHA-insured loans and VA-guaranteed loans), the twelve FHLBs, U.S. banks and thrifts, securities dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, investment funds and other mortgage investors. Our primary competitors for the issuance of single-family mortgage-related securities are Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, as many private market competitors dramatically reduced or ceased their activities in the single-family secondary mortgage market following the 2008 housing crisis. For the issuance of multifamily mortgage-related securities, we primarily compete with Freddie Mac, life insurers, U.S. banks and thrifts, other institutional investors, Ginnie Mae and private-label issuers of commercial mortgage-backed securities. 

We estimate that our single-family market share was 28% &#32;in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 . These amounts represent our single-family mortgage acquisitions for each year, excluding delinquent loans we purchased from our MBS trusts, as a percentage of the single-family first-lien mortgages we currently estimate were originated in the United States that year. Our estimate of mortgage originations in prior periods is subject to change as additional data become available; therefore, these market share estimates may change in the future, perhaps materially. 

We remained one of the largest issuers of mortgage-related securities in the secondary market in 2015 . We estimate our market share of new single-family mortgage-related securities issuances was 37% &#32;in 2015 , compared with 40% &#32;for 2014 . Our market share for new single-family mortgage-related securities issuances decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily as a result of competition from Ginnie Mae. 

We also compete for low-cost debt funding with institutions that hold mortgage portfolios, including Freddie Mac and the FHLBs. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of January 31, 2016, we employed approximately 7,300 &#32;personnel, including full-time and part-time employees, term employees and employees on leave.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. In addition, our senior management may from time to time make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the news media and others. Forward-looking statements often include words such as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;likely,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will&#8221; or similar words. 

Among the forward-looking statements in this report are statements relating to: 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will remain profitable on an annual basis for the foreseeable future; however, certain factors, such as changes in interest rates or home prices, could result in significant volatility in our financial results from quarter to quarter or year to year; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our future financial results also will be affected by a number of other factors, including: our guaranty fee rates; the volume of single-family mortgage originations in the future; the size, composition and quality of our retained mortgage portfolio and guaranty book of business; and economic and housing market conditions; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation of volatility from period to period in our financial results from a number of factors, particularly changes in market conditions that result in fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the financial instruments that we mark to market through our earnings; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will pay Treasury a senior preferred stock dividend for the first quarter of 2016 of $2.9 billion &#32;by March 31, 2016; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will retain only a limited amount of any future net worth because we are required by the dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock and quarterly directives from our conservator to pay Treasury each quarter the amount, if any, by which our net worth as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds an applicable capital reserve amount; 

&#8226; 

Our intention to continue to engage in credit risk transfer transactions on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that, over time, a larger portion of our single-family conventional guaranty book of business will be covered by credit risk transfer transactions; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the guaranty fee changes we implemented in September 2015 will not result in material changes to our single-family guaranty fee revenue or loan volume; 

&#8226; 

Our expectations that the volume of loans we acquire with 95.01% to 97% LTV ratios under our revised eligibility criteria and HomeReady will increase, but that these loans will continue to constitute only a small portion of our acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our acquisition of 95.01% to 97% LTV ratio loans under our revised eligibility criteria and under HomeReady will not materially affect our overall credit risk because we expect that: (1) our eligibility requirements for these loans will limit their effect on our credit risk; and (2) these loans will constitute a small portion of our acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our single-family acquisitions will continue to have a strong overall credit risk profile given our current underwriting and eligibility standards and product design; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that Collateral Underwriter&#8217;s integration with Desktop Underwriter will enhance our lenders&#8217; risk management and underwriting capabilities; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our elimination of fees charged to customers for using Desktop Underwriter and Desktop Originator will allow more lenders to access these systems in their underwriting process; 

&#8226; 

Our plans to implement additional enhancements to Desktop Underwriter in 2016 and our expectation that these enhancements will further help our lender customers originate mortgages with increased efficiency and lower costs and will help increase access to credit for creditworthy borrowers; 

&#8226; 

FHFA&#8217;s expectation that single-family credit risk transfers will continue to be an ongoing conservatorship requirement; 

&#8226; 

FHFA&#8217;s expectation that the common securitization platform and single security projects will remain ongoing conservatorship priorities; 

&#8226; 

FHFA&#8217;s expectation that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will implement the single security on the common securitization platform in 2018; 

&#8226; 

FHFA&#8217;s expectation that investors will treat legacy Fannie Mae MBS as fungible with the single securities; 

&#8226; 

FHFA&#8217;s expectation that, with the enhanced requirements FHFA announced in March 2015, nonperforming loan sales will result in more favorable outcomes for borrowers and local communities; 

&#8226; 

Our plan to complete additional nonperforming loan sales; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the guaranty fees we receive for managing the credit risk on loans underlying Fannie Mae MBS held by third parties will continue to account for an increasing portion of our net interest income; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our guaranty fee revenues will increase over the next several years, as loans with lower guaranty fees liquidate from our book of business and are replaced with new loans with higher guaranty fees; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that continued decreases in the size of our retained mortgage portfolio will continue to negatively impact our net interest income and net revenues; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that increases in our guaranty fee revenues will partially offset the negative impact of the decline in our retained mortgage portfolio, and that the extent to which the positive impact of increased guaranty fee revenues will offset the negative impact of the decline in the size of our retained mortgage portfolio will depend on many factors, including: changes to guaranty fee pricing we may make in the future and their impact on our competitive environment and guaranty fee revenues; the size, composition and quality of our guaranty book of business; the life of the loans in our guaranty book of business; the size, composition and quality of our retained mortgage portfolio; economic and housing market conditions, including changes in interest rates; our market share; and legislative and regulatory changes; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the risk associated with providing lenders with relief from repurchasing certain loans for breaches of certain representations and warranties; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that the implementation of a single security for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would likely reduce, and could eliminate, the trading advantage Fannie Mae MBS have over Freddie Mac PCs and, if this occurs, it could adversely affect our financial results; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the single-family serious delinquency rate for the overall mortgage market will continue to decline, and our belief that the rate of this decline will be gradual; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the national single-family serious delinquency rate will remain high compared with pre-housing crisis levels because it will take some time for the remaining delinquent loans originated prior to 2009 to work their way through the foreclosure process; 

&#8226; 

Our forecast that total originations in the U.S. single-family mortgage market in 2016 will decrease from 2015 levels by approximately 11% &#32;from an estimated $1.69 trillion &#32;in 2015 to $1.51 trillion &#32;in 2016; 

&#8226; 

Our forecast that the amount of originations in the U.S. single family mortgage market that are refinancings will decrease from an estimated $795 billion &#32;in 2015 to $558 billion &#32;in 2016; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the rate of home price appreciation in 2016 will be similar to the rate in 2015; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation of significant regional variation in the timing and rate of home price growth; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our credit losses will be lower in 2016 and future years than our 2015 credit losses, absent further significant redesignations or accounting policy changes; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our loss reserves will decline further; 

&#8226; 

The estimate that there will be approximately 384,000 &#32;new multifamily units completed in 2016; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that the increase in the supply of multifamily units concentrated in a limited number of metropolitan areas in 2016 will result in a temporary slowdown in net absorption rates, occupancy levels and effective rents in those areas throughout 2016; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that overall national rental market supply and demand will remain in balance over the longer term, based on expected construction completions, expected obsolescence and positive household formation trends; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company will continue; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that Congress will continue to consider legislation on the future status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including proposals that would result in Fannie Mae&#8217;s liquidation or dissolution; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation, pursuant to FHFA&#8217;s directive, that we will make our first payment of $217 million &#32;to specified HUD and Treasury funds on or before February 29, 2016, based on the amount of our new business purchases in 2015; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the final risk retention rule under the Dodd-Frank Act will not significantly change our current business practices; 

&#8226; 

Our intention not to exercise our contractual remedies for noncompliance with the newly applicable provisions of TRID except in two limited circumstances; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our placement into receivership would likely have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock and preferred stock, and could have a material adverse effect on holders of our debt securities and Fannie Mae MBS; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that, if we are liquidated, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient funds remaining after payment of amounts to our creditors and to Treasury as holder of the senior preferred stock to make any distribution to holders of our common stock and other preferred stock; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that if there were several high-level employee departures at approximately the same time, our ability to conduct our business would likely be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will continue to devote significant resources to meeting FHFA&#8217;s goals for our conservatorship; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the common securitization platform and single security initiative and related internal infrastructure upgrades will result in significant changes to our current systems and operations; 

&#8226; 

Our intention to sell our current principal office located at 3900 Wisconsin Ave, NW, Washington, DC, as well as two other Washington, DC office facilities; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that administrative expenses will be lower in 2016 compared with 2015; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the guaranty fees we collect and the expenses we incur under the TCCA will continue to increase in the future; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that, as we continue to reduce the number of single-family nonperforming loans held for investment in our book of business, changes in home prices will have a lesser impact on our provision for credit losses; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will continue to purchase loans from MBS trusts as they become four or more consecutive monthly payments delinquent subject to market conditions, economic benefit, servicer capacity and other factors, including the limit on the amount of mortgage assets that we may own pursuant to the senior preferred stock purchase agreement with Treasury and FHFA&#8217;s portfolio plan requirements; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that our liquidity contingency plans may be difficult or impossible to execute for a company of our size in our circumstances; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that the amount of mortgage-related assets that we could successfully sell or borrow against in the event of a liquidity crisis or significant market disruption is substantially lower than the amount of mortgage-related assets we hold; 

&#8226; 

Our intention to repay our short-term and long-term debt obligations as they become due primarily through proceeds from the issuance of additional debt securities; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we may also use proceeds from our mortgage assets to pay our debt obligations; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that continued federal government support of our business, as well as our status as a GSE, are essential to maintaining our access to debt funding; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that changes or perceived changes in federal government support of our business or our status as a GSE could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations; 

&#8226; 

Our expectations regarding our credit ratings and their impact on us as set forth in &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Management&#8212;Liquidity Management&#8212;Credit Ratings&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will not remediate the material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures while we are under conservatorship; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the serious delinquency rates for single-family loans acquired in more recent years will be higher after the loans have aged, but will not approach the levels of the December 31, 2015 serious delinquency rates of loans acquired in 2005 through 2008; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the ultimate performance of all our loans will be affected by borrower behavior, public policy and macroeconomic trends, including unemployment, the economy and home prices; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that loans we acquire under Refi Plus and HARP will perform better than the loans they replace, because they should either reduce the borrowers&#8217; monthly payments or provide more stable terms than the borrowers&#8217; old loans (for example, by refinancing into a mortgage with a fixed interest rate instead of an adjustable rate); 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the volume of refinancings under HARP will continue to decline, due to a decrease in the population of borrowers with loans that have high LTV ratios who are willing to refinance and would benefit from refinancing; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our acquisitions of Alt-A mortgage loans (which are limited to refinancings of existing Fannie Mae loans) will continue to be minimal in future periods and the percentage of the book of business attributable to Alt-A will continue to decrease over time; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that we have limited exposure to credit losses on home equity conversion mortgages; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that the current performance trend for our interest-only loans and negative-amortizing loans that have recently reset compared to those that are still in the initial period would not continue if interest rates rose significantly; 

&#8226; 

Our belief that retaining special servicers to service some delinquent loan populations that include loans with higher-risk characteristics using high-touch protocols will reduce our future credit losses on the transferred loan portfolio; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our single-family serious delinquency rate will continue to decrease; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that, as a result of our various loss mitigation and foreclosure prevention efforts, a portion of the loans in the process of formal foreclosure proceedings will not ultimately foreclose; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that, as a result of allowing lenders to remit payment equal to our losses on loans after we have disposed of the related REO, our actual cash receipts relating to our outstanding repurchase requests will be significantly lower than the unpaid principal balance of the loans; 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that our institutional credit risk exposure to derivatives clearing organizations and certain of their members will increase substantially in the future as cleared derivative contracts comprise a larger percentage of our derivative instruments; 

&#8226; 

Our assumption that the guaranty fee income generated from our future business activity will largely replace the guaranty fee income lost due to mortgage prepayments; 

&#8226; 

Our expectations regarding our role as HAMP program administrator, including how long we will continue in the role and amounts we will receive from Treasury pursuant to the role; and 

&#8226; 

Our expectation that we will receive full cash payment from only half of our non-governmental financial guarantor counterparties.
