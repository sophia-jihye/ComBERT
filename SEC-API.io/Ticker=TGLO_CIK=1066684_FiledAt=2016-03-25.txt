 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

theglobe.com, inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;theglobe&#8221;) was incorporated on May 1, 1995 (inception) and commenced operations on that date. Originally, theglobe was an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. As more fully discussed in the section below entitled &#8220;Sale of Tralliance and Share Issuance,&#8221; on September 29, 2008, theglobe consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary (&#8220;Tralliance&#8221;) to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC (&#8220;Tralliance Registry Management&#8221;), an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, the Company&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of its Tralliance business, which was theglobe&#8217;s last remaining operating business, theglobe became a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets. At the present time, theglobe has no plans to acquire or start-up any new businesses.

&#160;

As part of the consideration for the sale of its Tralliance business, theglobe received earn-out rights from Tralliance Registry Management (as described below, the &#8220;Earn-Out&#8221;), which rights constituted the only source of income for theglobe as a shell company and which rights expired on May 5, 2015. As a shell company, theglobe&#8217;s operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and are expected to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, as reflected in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet, our current liabilities significantly exceed our total assets. Additionally, we received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2015 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. It is the Company&#8217;s preference to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless the Company is successful in restructuring or settling its current liabilities and/or raising additional debt or equity securities, it may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, theglobe currently intends to continue as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

SALE OF TRALLIANCE AND SHARE ISSUANCE 

&#160;

On September 29, 2008, the Company (i) sold the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary to Tralliance Registry Management and (ii) issued 229 million shares of its Common Stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) to The Registry Management Company, LLC (&#8220;Registry Management&#8221;), (the &#8220;Purchase Transaction&#8221;). Tralliance Registry Management and Registry Management are entities directly or indirectly controlled by Michael S. Egan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and principal stockholder, and each of our two remaining executive officers and Board members, Edward A. Cespedes, our President, and Robin Segaul Lebowitz, our Vice President of Finance, own a minority interest in Registry Management. After giving effect to the closing of the Purchase Transaction, and the issuance of the Shares thereunder, Mr. Egan beneficially owned approximately 76% of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock and continues to beneficially own such amount at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In connection with the Purchase Transaction, the Company received (i) forgiveness of debt consideration totaling approximately $6.4 million, and (ii) an earn-out equal to 10% (subject to certain minimums) of Tralliance Registry Management&#8217;s &#8220;net revenue&#8221; (as defined) derived from &#8220;.travel&#8221; names registered by Tralliance Registry Management from September 29, 2008 through May 5, 2015 (the &#8220;Earn-out&#8221;). The minimum Earn-out payable by Tralliance Registry Management to theglobe was $300 thousand in the first year of the Earn-out Agreement, increasing by $25 thousand in each subsequent year (pro-rated for the final year of the Earn-out). The final pro-rated Earn-out payment of $37 thousand was received by the Company in May 2015 and the Earn-out Agreement has now expired.

&#160;

Commensurate with the closing of the Purchase Transaction on September 29, 2008, the Company also entered into Termination Agreements with each of its executive officers (each a &#8220;Termination Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Termination Agreements, the Company&#8217;s employment agreements with each of Michael S. Egan, Edward A. Cespedes and Robin Segaul Lebowitz, the Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice President of Finance, all dated August 1, 2003, respectively, were terminated. Notwithstanding the termination of these employment agreements, each of Messrs. Egan, Cespedes and Ms. Lebowitz remains as an officer and director of the Company.

&#160;

In connection with the closing of the Purchase Transaction, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (&#8220;Services Agreement&#8221;) with Dancing Bear Investments, Inc. (&#8220;Dancing Bear&#8221;), an entity which is controlled by Mr. Egan. Under the terms of the Services Agreement, for a fee of $20 thousand per month ($240 thousand per annum), Dancing Bear provides personnel and services to the Company so as to enable it to continue its existence as a public company without the necessity of any full-time employees of its own. The Services Agreement had an initial term of one year. The Services Agreement now automatically renews for additional one year terms unless notice is given by either party of intent not to renew, and has currently been renewed through September 2016. Services under the Services Agreement include, without limitation, accounting, assistance with financial reporting, accounts payable, treasury/financial planning, record retention and secretarial and investor relations functions.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of March 1, 2016, we had no employees other than our executive officers. Each of our executive officers are officers or directors of other companies, certain of which have ongoing business relationships with the Company. Our executive officers currently devote very limited time to our business and receive no compensation from us. As discussed earlier, the business of the Company is currently managed by Dancing Bear Investments, Inc., an entity which is controlled by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, under a Master Services Agreement entered into on September 29, 2008.
