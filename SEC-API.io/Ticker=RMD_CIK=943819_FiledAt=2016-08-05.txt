General 

&#160; 

We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing, or SDB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based software digital health applications, along with our devices are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers. 

&#160; 

Following our formation in 1989, we commercialized a treatment for OSA. This treatment, nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a nasal mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep. 

&#160; 

Since the development of CPAP, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including 

&#160;

technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, portable oxygen concentrators, or POCs and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like COPD as significant health concerns. 

&#160; 

We employ approximately 5,250 people and sell our products in approximately 100 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors. 

&#160; 

Our web site address is www.resmed.com. We make our periodic reports, together with any amendments, available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Information contained on the website is not part of or incorporated into this annual report. 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries. In June 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market. In September 1999 we transferred our principal listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol RMD. In November 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDIs, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol RMD. Ten CDIs on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE. 

&#160; 

Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter&#146;s existing CPAP device business. Baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987, and sold CPAP devices in Australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business. 

&#160; 

Since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors, suppliers, developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solutions providers. 

&#160; 

Segment Information 

&#160; 

We have determined that we predominantly operate in a single operating segment, which is the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry. Due to the acquisition of Brightree LLC in April 2016, our operations now include the supply of business management software and services to medical equipment and home health providers. However, these operations, both in terms of revenue and profit, are not material to our global operations and therefore have not been separately reported. See Note 15 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

The Market 

&#160; 

We are focused on underpenetrated markets in the sleep and related respiratory care market where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers, help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs. 

&#160;

Sleep 

&#160; 

Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest. 

&#160; 

The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. In addition, OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes. 

&#160; 

A long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults age 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the United States alone, this represents approximately 46 million people. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA. 

&#160; 

While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, it is predominant among middle-aged men and those who are obese, smoke, consume alcohol in excess or use muscle-relaxing and pain-killing drugs. A strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes, approximately 77% of patients with obesity and approximately 76% of patients with congestive heart failure. 

&#160; 

Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea 

&#160; 

Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB. 

&#160; 

Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents. 

&#160; 

- 3 - 

Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient&#146;s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our Apnealink, or our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious awakenings. 

&#160; 

Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient&#146;s windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods. Surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for OSA. Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles. Alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development. 

&#160; 

A variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective, but CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway. CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid 1980&#146;s. During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airdevice that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface. 

&#160; 

CPAP is not a cure and therefore, must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including Variable Positive Airway Pressure, or VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night. 

&#160; 

Respiratory Care 

&#160; 

Our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients suffering from COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or OHS, and neuromuscular disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We aim to improve their quality of life and slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management. 

&#160; 

- 4 - 

Our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP or VPAP systems at night, through to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support and those who require long-term oxygen therapy. Our devices are used in the home, general hospital wards, respiratory wards and the acute and intensive care setting. We supply CPAP and VPAP systems, non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers and accessories, including masks and tubing. In addition, we supply specific support solutions for non-invasive and invasive ventilation including mouth piece ventilation, secretion clearance assistance and battery back-up. We also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of long-term oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients. 

&#160; 

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease . COPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs. It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways to noxious gases or particles. Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath on exertion as well as chronic cough and sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It is estimated that up to 10% of adults of at least 40 years of age worldwide suffer from COPD. 

&#160; 

Patients with COPD can have different clinical presentations. Patients with chronic bronchitis present with hypoxemia and hypercapnia, a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity. During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia. In general, the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep. Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep. Some COPD patients may also suffer from co-morbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome. 

&#160; 

Overlap Syndrome . In patients with Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange. Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing. It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing and complication rates of factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. In patients with stable COPD the advantages of home NIV are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnoea scores and health-related quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays. 

&#160; 

Long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT, is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients. The administration of LTOT has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia. In hypoxemic COPD patients LTOT is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and improved health-related quality of life measures. In long-term COPD survivors with a history of congestive heart failure, LTOT is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression. 

&#160; 

Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. OHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and SDB after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. OHS is frequently associated with OSA with an estimated 90% of patients also having OSA. 

&#160; 

In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, both CPAP and NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive. 

&#160; 

- 5 - 

Neuromuscular Disease . Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can be progress rapidly or slowly. Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years. Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as Myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy. 

&#160; 

NIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases. In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival. Studies have demonstrated that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and survival with NIV treatment. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe that the SDB and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors, including increasing awareness of OSA and COPD, improved understanding of the role of SDB treatment in the management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic and related disorders, and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the SDB and respiratory care markets consists of the following key elements: 

&#160; 

Continue Product Development and Innovation.&#160; We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat SDB more effectively, increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. For example, in 2013, we introduced new products across both our mask and device categories, including the VPAP COPD, Quattro Air, Swift FX Bella, Swift FX Nano and ResMed&#146;s SleepSeeker. In 2014, we introduced the AirFit&#153; P10 nasal pillows system, AirFit&#153; N10 nasal mask, AirFit&#153; F10 full-face mask and the Astral&#153; platform, our new generation of life support ventilators. During fiscal year 2015, we released significant new products across our device categories, including the AirSense TM 10, AirCurve TM 10, and Lumis. In 2015, we also released the AirView TM , our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, along with our Air Solutions platform that provides a suite of end-to-end healthcare informatics solutions that address customer business processes from diagnosis to monitoring and patient management and billing. In 2016, we introduced a number of new software solutions including our ResMed Resupply, GoScripts and new features and enhancements within our cloud-based software offerings. Through our acquisition of Brightree, we also acquired a suite of software-as-a-service solutions for U.S. based distributor and home health and hospice customers. In addition, through our acquisitions of Inova Labs and Curative Medical we acquired the Inova Labs range of POCs and a portfolio of Curative Medical SDB and ventilation products. We believe that the combination of continued product development, product and technology acquisitions and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. Approximately 13% of our employees are devoted to research and development activities. In fiscal year 2016, we invested $118.7 million, or approximately 6% of our net revenues, in research and development. 

&#160; 

- 6 - 

Expand Geographic Presence.&#160; We market our products in more than 100 countries to sleep clinics, home healthcare dealers, patients and third-party payors. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets, as well as expand the depth of our presence in other high-growth geographic regions. In 2016, we acquired Curative Medical to invest in the China market and expand our growth potential in SDB, COPD and respiratory care in China. 

&#160; 

Respiratory Care. We are committed to ongoing innovation of our respiratory care products that serve the needs of patients with neuromuscular diseases and a growing global COPD patient population. With the addition of Inova Labs POCs and our non-invasive ventilator devices and masks and accessories, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings in this area. 

&#160; 

Increase Public and Clinical Awareness.&#160; We continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of SDB, COPD and our treatment alternatives. These promotional activities target both the population predisposed to SDB and medical specialists, such as cardiologists, neurologists and pulmonologists. In addition, we also target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association and the National Sleep Foundation, which should further increase awareness of the relationship between SDB or OSA, COPD, neuromuscular disease and co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. We have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the University of California at San Diego in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD as well as the establishment of two perpetual academic chairs at the University of Sydney, called the ResMed Chair of Sleep Medicine for sleep-disordered breathing with a focus on chronic disease and the ResMed Chair of Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis on bio-informatics research. 

&#160; 

Expand into New Clinical Applications. We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and congestive heart failure, and have recognized SDB as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that SDB is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology. In 2014, we received Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance and launched a new product in the United States for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular diseases. 

&#160; 

Leverage the Experience of our Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the fields of SDB, respiratory care and healthcare informatics in particular. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and solutions, and to increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by SDB and the use of in-home life support ventilation to treat COPD. 

&#160;

Product Development and Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

We have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings, but also expanding into new product applications. 

&#160; 

We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. SDB is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability. Studies have established a clinical association between SDB and hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure and diabetes. We support clinical trials in many countries including the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, China and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology. 

&#160; 

We consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of SDB. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, network of distributors, customers and patients. 

&#160; 

In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 we invested $118.7 million, $114.9 million and $118.2 million, respectively, on research and development. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We currently market our products in more than 100 countries through a network of distributors and our direct sales force. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market, based on regional awareness of SDB as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies. See Note 15 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas. 

&#160; 

North America and Latin America. Our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: the prescribing physician and his or her staff; the home healthcare dealer; the insurer and the patient. In North and Latin America, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout North and Latin America. 

&#160; 

We also market our products directly to physicians and sleep clinics. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription. The home healthcare dealer, in consultation with the referring physician, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level. 

&#160; 

Sales in North and Latin America accounted for 61%, 57% and 54% of our net revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Europe. We market our products in most major European countries. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of Europe. Distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to SDB therapy. In each country in which we sell our products direct, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In many countries in Europe, we sell our products to home healthcare dealers or hospitals who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, we also operate a home healthcare company, in which we provide products and services directly to patients, and receive reimbursement directly from third-party payors. 

&#160; 

Sales in Europe accounted for 29%, 32% and 36% of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Asia Pacific. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan. We use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in Asia Pacific. In Australia and New Zealand, we operate a home healthcare business and sell our products and services directly to patients. Sales in Asia Pacific accounted for 10%, 11% and 10% of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Market Growth Opportunities 

&#160; 

We view the future of our business in sleep and respiratory disorders as having three horizons of growth supported by three key foundations. 

&#160; 

Our three key foundations reach across all three of our horizons and include: our focus on operating excellence and high efficiency to leverages our global scale; second, our global leadership in digital 

&#160; 

- 13 - 

health and connected care, an important advance in our product and solution offerings; and third, our expansion into high growth geographic areas including China, India, Eastern Europe, Brazil and Southeast Asia. 

&#160; 

The first horizon includes our existing market in OSA treatment, where we believe our leadership in digital health and connected care is becoming an important distinguishing factor from our competitors. The use of technologies that allow remote collection and transfer of information through cloud-based computing is changing the current clinical pathways for following up with patients who use our devices, which we believe provides an opportunity to improve patient care and create efficiencies for customers and providers. We plan to continue to invest and expand our capabilities in this area. 

&#160; 

The second horizon includes the use of connected devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home. We believe that COPD is a large and underpenetrated market where there are unmet patient needs as the global population with COPD continues to expand due to smoking and poor air quality. Some patients with later-stage COPD may benefit from the use of ventilation at night, but until recently only a small number of COPD patients were treated using ventilation on a long-term basis. A study published in 2014 found that patients with stable but severe COPD using non-invasive ventilation nightly for six months experienced a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity. The findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for NIV. Additionally, the use of NIV is becoming routine in many acute care hospitals, as guidelines stipulate its use in acute exacerbations and familiarity with the techniques involved increases. In 2016, we expanded our product portfolio for the treatment of COPD with our acquisition of Inova Labs, a company that designs and manufactures POCs. Many patients in earlier stages of COPD may require oxygen therapy and through the use of NIV and POC products they can receive this treatment in the home. 

&#160; 

Our third horizon focuses on a portfolio of new market options including chronic disease management, sleep and consumer wellness and clinical areas of interest in adjacent markets like atrial fibrillation, heart failure and asthma. 

&#160; 

We continue to approach this horizon by emphasizing relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology, and related clinical areas. A growing body of literature documents the association and interactions between a number of cardiac diseases and SDB. OSA is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is prevalent in hypertensive populations, particularly those resistant to therapy. Treatment with CPAP tends to lower blood pressure. OSA is prevalent in those with atrial fibrillation and may trigger episodes of fibrillation. Treatment with CPAP appears to improve outcomes. OSA is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general. Heart failure is also commonly associated with both OSA and CSA, and both forms of SDB are risk factors for poor outcomes. We are undertaking several clinical trials in cardiology to strengthen the knowledge base on the effects of SDB therapy on outcomes. In addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of SDB in cardiology patients. 

&#160; 

We are also working with occupational health professionals to raise awareness of the issues caused by untreated OSA in the workplace including accidents, absenteeism and reduced productivity, plus increased costs for employers who provide healthcare coverage for employees. 

&#160; 

We continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties. We believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our devices, masks and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, most are off-the-shelf items available from multiple vendors. We also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. Any reduction or halt in supply from one of these single-source suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. Over the last few years, the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams. Each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback. 

&#160; 

Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, FDA Quality System Regulations for Medical Devices, the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our main manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485. These sites are subject to third-party audits, conducted by the ISO notified bodies, at regular intervals. 

&#160; 

Details of our main manufacturing facilities are:

&#160; 

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

The cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany, we receive payments directly from these payors. Outside Germany, although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors, our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for our products. 

&#160; 

In the United States, our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers, hospitals or sleep clinics, who invoice third-party payors directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payors 

&#160; 

- 15 - 

include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products. In some foreign markets, such as France, Germany and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA. 

&#160; 

The past decade of legislative reform in the United States, including, by way of example, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA), Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), has significantly impacted government reimbursement for products that we provide. The longer term impact, though not entirely predictable, continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape. 

&#160; 

Beginning in 2005, the MMA established a Medicare competitive acquisition program for home medical equipment (HME) and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for HME suppliers. Effective 2011, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented Round 1 of competitive bidding in 9 competitive bidding areas, or CBAs, and included home medical equipment that we manufacture and develop, specifically, CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories. The average reduction from the then current Medicare payment rates in Round 1 of competitive bidding implemented was approximately 32% overall and 34% for CPAP and respiratory devices. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years. Since then there has been one recompete completed for Round 1 with rates that went into effect on January 1, 2014. In 2013, CMS announced the single payment amounts for Round 2, which covered a total of 91 CBAs. Effective July 1, 2013, the average reduction from the then-current Medicare payment rates in Round 2 was approximately 47% on a weighted average basis for CPAP and respiratory devices. In 2016, CMS implemented the Round 2 Recompete, which covered a total of 117 CBAs, and announced the single payment amounts, effective July 1, 2016. In addition, the ACA required CMS to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas, also known as the Round 3 areas, to match competitive bidding prices by 2016. CMS phased in the new rates beginning January 1, 2016, and were fully effective July 1, 2016. 

&#160; 

The ACA, which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources, also included, among other things, a deductible excise tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which medical devices are sold in the United States on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices, with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013. However, this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the U.S. Congress for medical device sales during calendar years 2016 and 2017. If this excise tax had not been suspended it would be applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs, which includes the ApneaLink, VPAP Tx, certain Respiratory Care and dental sleep products. Absent further Congressional action, this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2018. The ACA also provided for a number of Medicare regulatory requirements, including new face-to-face encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict at this time the full impact of the ACA, or any U.S. legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. 

&#160; 

- 16 - 

Service and Warranty 

&#160; 

We generally offer either one-year or two-year limited warranties on our devices. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days. Our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement. 

&#160; 

We receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical data. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets for our products are highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features, value-added solutions, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors. 

&#160; 

We compete on a market-by-market basis with various companies, some of which have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Our primary competitors include Philips BV; Fisher &#38; Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; and regional manufacturers. The disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry. In addition, some of our competitors, such as Weinmann Ger&#228;te f&#252;r Medizin GmbH + Co. KG, are affiliates of customers of ours, which may make it difficult to compete with them. Finally, our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other SDB-related respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights. 

&#160; 

Through our various subsidiaries, as of the date of this annual report, we own or have licensed rights to approximately 1,043 issued United States patents (including approximately 413 design patents) and approximately 2,020 issued foreign patents. In addition, there are approximately 470 pending United States patent applications (including approximately 44 design patent applications), approximately 952 pending foreign patent applications, approximately 1,143 registered foreign designs and 54 pending foreign designs. Some of these patents, patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products. 

&#160; 

Of our patents, 193 United States patents and 427 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years. There are 25 United States patents due to expire in 2017, 54 United States patents in 2018, 16 United States patents in 2019, 71 United States patents in 2020, and 27 United States patents in 2021. There are 35 foreign patents due to expire in 2017, 102 in 2018, 54 in 2019, 150 in 2020, and 86 in 2021. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position. 

&#160; 

- 17 - 

Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

FDA 

&#160; 

Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device&#146;s safety and effectiveness. 

&#160; 

Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as &#147;predicate device.&#148; As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information. 

&#160; 

Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device&#146;s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using 

&#160; 

- 18 - 

available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. The FDA is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination. It is unclear whether the FDA&#146;s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510(k) is required for changes or modifications to existing devices. 

&#160; 

Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDA&#146;s regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

&#160; 

Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as &#147;off-label&#148; promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval for sale of our medical devices in Europe is through the CE mark process. Where appropriate, our products are CE marked to the European Union&#146;s Medical Device Directive. Under the CE marketing scheme, our products are classified as either Class I or Class II. Our devices are listed in Australia with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and in Canada with Health Canada. 

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws 

&#160; 

Even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the United States, we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. 

&#160; 

- 19 - 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. 

&#160; 

Also, many states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 

&#160; 

Under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

In some of our operations, such as those involving our cloud-based software digital health applications, we are a business associate under HIPAA and therefore required to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so. 

&#160; 

Numerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that 

&#160;

further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states&#146; Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information. 

&#160; 

Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act was enacted in law as part of ACA, which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer&#146;s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. 

&#160; 

The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 5,250 employees or full-time consultants, of which approximately 1,745 were employed in warehousing and manufacturing, 805 in research and development and 2,700 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees and consultants, approximately 1,545 were located in North and Latin America, 1,400 in Australia, 1,280 in Europe and 1,025 in Asia. 

&#160; 

We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
