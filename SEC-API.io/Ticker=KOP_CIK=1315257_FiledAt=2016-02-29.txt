 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

In this report, unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, (i) the term &#8220;Koppers&#8221;, &#8220;Koppers Holdings&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; refers to Koppers Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (ii) the term &#8220;KH&#8221; refers to Koppers Holdings Inc. and not any of its subsidiaries and (iii) the term &#8220;KI&#8221; refers to Koppers Inc. and not any of its subsidiaries. Koppers Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koppers Holdings Inc. Koppers Holdings Inc. has substantially no operations independent of Koppers Inc. and its subsidiaries. The use of these terms is not intended to imply that Koppers Holdings and Koppers Inc. are not separate and distinct legal entities from each other and from their respective subsidiaries.

Koppers Holdings Inc. was incorporated in November 2004 as a holding company for Koppers Inc. We are a leading integrated global provider of treated wood products, wood treatment chemicals, and carbon compounds. Our products and services are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end-markets, including the railroad, specialty chemical, utility, residential lumber, agriculture, aluminum, steel, rubber, and construction industries. We serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network, with manufacturing facilities located in North America, South America, Australasia, China and Europe.

Business Segments and Products

We operate three principal business segments: Railroad and Utility Products and Services (&#8220;RUPS&#8221;), Carbon Materials and Chemicals (&#8220;CMC&#8221;), and Performance Chemicals (&#8220;PC&#8221;).

Our RUPS and CMC operations are, to a substantial extent, vertically integrated. Through our CMC business, we process coal tar into a variety of products, including carbon pitch, creosote, carbon black feedstock, naphthalene and phthalic anhydride, which are intermediate materials necessary in the production of aluminum, the pressure treatment of wood, the production of carbon black for the rubber industry, the production of high-strength concrete, and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals, respectively. The majority of the creosote we produce in North America is sold internally to our RUPS business for treating railroad crossties. 

We believe our three business segments command leading market positions. Through our RUPS business, we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the North American railroads. Through our CMC business, we believe we are the largest global supplier of carbon pitch to the aluminum industry and the largest global supplier of creosote to the North American railroad industry. Through our PC business, we believe that we are the global leader in developing, manufacturing and marketing wood preservation chemicals and wood treatment technologies for use in pressure treating lumber for residential, industrial and agricultural applications.

Railroad and Utility Products and Services

Our RUPS business sells treated and untreated wood products, rail joint bars and services primarily to the railroad markets in the United States and Canada and the utility market in Australia. We also operate a railroad services business that conducts engineering, design, repair and inspection services for railroad bridges, serving the same customer base as our North American railroad business.

Railroad products and services include procuring and treating items such as crossties, switch ties and various types of lumber used for railroad bridges and crossings. Railroad products also include manufacturing and selling rail joint bars, which are steel bars used to join rails together for railroads. Utility products, located in Australia, include transmission and distribution poles for electric and telephone utilities. The RUPS business operates 14 wood treating plants and one rail joint bar manufacturing facility located throughout the United States, Canada and Australia. Our network of plants is strategically located near timber supplies to enable us to access raw materials and service customers effectively. In addition, our crosstie treating plants are typically adjacent to our railroad customers&#8217; track lines.

Our RUPS business manufactures its primary products and sells them directly to our customers through long-term contracts and purchase orders negotiated by our regional sales personnel and coordinated through our marketing group at corporate headquarters.

Hardwoods, such as oak and other species, are the major raw materials in wood crossties. Hardwood prices, which account for more than 50 percent of a finished crosstie&#8217;s cost, fluctuate with the demand from other hardwood lumber markets, such as oak flooring, pallets and other specialty lumber products. For example, over the past couple years we have been impacted in our ability to acquire hardwood due to the demand for crane mats associated with the oil and gas industry. During 2015 the demand from these competing markets was reduced as lower oil prices resulted in lower spending for oil and gas operations. Weather conditions can be a factor in the supply of raw material, as unusually wet or inclement conditions may make it difficult to harvest timber.

Koppers Holdings Inc. 2015 Annual Report 

&#160;

In the United States, hardwood lumber for crossties is procured by us from hundreds of small sawmills throughout the northeastern, midwestern and southern areas of the country. The crossties are shipped via rail car or trucked dire ctly to one of our crosstie treating plants, all of which are on line with a major railroad. The crossties are either air-stacked for a period of six to nine months or artificially dried by a process called boultonizing. Once dried, the crossties are press ure treated with creosote, a product of our CMC business. A substantial portion of our crossties are treated with borate, which is purchased from PC, in combination with creosote. 

We believe we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties in North America. We have one principal competitor, Stella-Jones Inc., and several smaller regional competitors in the North American market. Competitive factors in the railroad crosstie market include price, quality, location, service and security of supply. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to our ability to obtain internally-produced creosote and borate and our national network of treating plants which have direct access to our major customers&#8217; rail lines. These advantages provide for security of supply and logistics advantages for our customers. We believe our Australian utility pole business is the largest producer of utility poles for the electrical communications utilities in Australia.

Our RUPS business&#8217;s largest customer base is the North American Class I railroad market, which buys approximately 74 percent of all crossties produced in the United States and Canada. We also have relationships with many of the approximately 550 short-line and regional rail lines. This also forms the customer base for our rail joint bar products. The railroad crosstie market is a mature market with approximately 23 million replacement crossties (both wood and non-wood) purchased during 2015. We currently supply all seven of the North American Class I railroads and have contracts with all of them.

Demand for railroad crossties may decline during winter months due to inclement weather conditions which make it difficult to harvest lumber and to install railroad crossties. As a result, operating results may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the severity of weather conditions and other variables affecting our products.

Utility poles are produced mainly from the eucalyptus species in Australia. Most of these poles are purchased from large timber owners and individual landowners and shipped to one of our pole-peeling facilities. In Australia, in addition to utility poles, we market smaller poles to the agricultural landscape and vineyard markets. We treat poles with a variety of preservatives, including pentachlorophenol and copper chromated arsenates.

Carbon Materials and Chemicals

Our CMC business manufactures its primary products and sells them directly to our global customer base under long-term contracts or through purchase orders negotiated by our regional sales personnel and coordinated through our global marketing group in the United States. Our four coal tar distillation facilities and five carbon materials terminals give us the ability to offer customers multiple sourcing and a consistent supply of high quality products.

Our CMC business has experienced challenges over the past few years due to the closure of aluminum smelters that has occurred in North America, Western Europe and Australia. The smelting of aluminum requires significant amounts of energy, which is a major cost component for the aluminum industry. As a result, new production facilities are being built in regions with low energy costs such as the Middle East, while regions with higher energy costs such as the United States, Australia and Western Europe have seen significant amounts of smelting capacity idled or closed over the last several years. As a result we have embarked on a plan to restructure our CMC operating footprint that we expect will eventually reduce our global number of coal tar distillation facilities from the 11 that existed as of January 1, 2014 to four in total. 

Creosote, carbon pitch, naphthalene, and carbon black feedstock are produced through the distillation of coal tar, a by-product generated through the processing of coal into coke for use in steel and iron manufacturing. Coal tar distillation involves the conversion of coal tar into a variety of intermediate chemical products in processes beginning with distillation. During the distillation process, heat and vacuum are utilized to separate coal tar into three primary components: chemical oils (approximately 20 percent), distillate (approximately 30 percent), and carbon pitch (approximately 50 percent). The following diagram shows the streams derived from coal tar distillation:

&#160; 

In the United States, our coal tar raw material supply contracts generally have terms ranging from six months to three years, and most provide options for renewal. Pricing under these contracts is typically negotiated on a semi-annual or annual basis. Our primary European tar supply contract has a remaining term of approximately four years and thereafter extends indefinitely unless terminated by a one-year advance notice and contains formula-based tar pricing. Our primary Australian supply contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years and contain formula-based pricing which is adjusted on an annual or semi-annual basis. Finally, in China, we have a raw material contract in place with our joint venture partner. This contract is coterminous with the applicable joint venture arrangement and provides for formula-based pricing adjusted on a monthly or quarterly basis.

Our CMC business manufactures the following principal products:

&#160;

&#161; 

creosote, used in the treatment of wood or as a feedstock in the production of carbon black; 

&#160;

&#161; 

carbon pitch, a critical raw material used in the production of aluminum and steel; 

&#160;

&#161; 

naphthalene, used for the production of phthalic anhydride and as a surfactant in the production of concrete, and 

&#160;

&#161; 

phthalic anhydride, used in the production of plasticizers, polyester resins and alkyd paints, respectively. 

Creosote and Carbon Black Feedstock

In the United States and Canada, creosote is used as a commercial wood treatment chemical to preserve railroad crossties and lumber, utility poles and piling. The majority of our creosote is sold to our RUPS business. In Australia, China and Europe, creosote is sold primarily into the carbon black market for use as a feedstock in the production of carbon black. In Europe creosote is also sold to wood treaters and is exported into North America. Our wood treating plants in North America purchase substantially all of their creosote from our tar distillation plants. We believe we are the only major competitor in this market that is substantially integrated in this fashion. The remainder of our creosote is sold to railroads and other wood treaters.

Carbon Pitch

Carbon pitch is a critical raw material used in the production of aluminum, the production of steel in electric arc furnaces, and the production of needle coke used to form electrodes for electric arc steel production. We have been a leading supplier of carbon pitch to the aluminum industry for over 25 years. Approximately one ton of carbon pitch is required for every 10 tons of aluminum produced and there are currently no known viable substitutes for carbon pitch in the aluminum production process. Over 80 percent of our carbon pitch is sold to the aluminum industry, typically under long-term contracts ranging from three to five years. Many of these long-term contracts have provisions for periodic pricing reviews. Competitive factors in the carbon pitch market include price, quality, service and security of supply.

Naphthalene and Phthalic Anhydride

Chemical oils are further processed to produce naphthalene, which we sell into the industrial sulfonate market for use as dispersants or in the concrete additive and gypsum board markets. Additional end-uses include oil field additives, agricultural emulsifiers, synthetic tanning agents and dyestuffs. In the United States, we also use naphthalene as a feedstock in the manufacture of phthalic anhydride. The primary markets for phthalic anhydride are in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins and alkyd resins. On a historical basis, we believe our ability to utilize our internally produced naphthalene has given us a more stable supply and generally lower-cost feedstock for the production of phthalic anhydride 

Koppers Holdings Inc. 2015 Annual Report 

&#160;

compared to our competitors. However, the dramatic decline in oil prices over the past 12 -18 months has resulted in a significant decline in profitability for phthalic anhydride, as pricing for this product trends with oil prices. 

Other Products

Other products include the sale of refined tars, benzole and specialty chemicals.

Performance Chemicals

Our PC business maintains sales and manufacturing operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia and New Zealand. We believe we are the largest global manufacturer and supplier of water-based wood preservatives and wood specialty additives to treaters who supply the residential, agricultural, and industrial pressure-treated wood market. The primary products supplied by PC are copper-based wood preservatives, including micronized copper quaternary and micronized copper azole (&#8220;MicroPro&#174;&#8221;), micronized pigments (MicroShades&#174;), alkaline copper quaternary, amine copper azole and chromated copper arsenate. The primary applications for these products include decking, fencing, utility poles, construction lumber and timbers, and vineyard stakes. Because we are a global supplier of wood preservatives, we face various competitors in all the geographic regions in which we participate. 

The United States is the largest treated wood market in the world and PC supplies six of the ten largest lumber treating companies in the United States in addition to three of the four largest lumber treating companies in Canada. In North America, our PC business is vertically integrated through the manufacturing of copper compounds for our copper-based wood preservatives. We purchase and process over 20 million pounds of our key raw material, scrap copper, to meet the demand of this major market. Once the scrap copper is purchased, it is shipped to our manufacturing plants in Hubbell, Michigan and Millington, Tennessee for further processing into other copper compounds. During 2015, scrap copper pricing followed the London Metal Exchange and the Comex trend by falling in price by approximately 25 percent. We experienced some copper supply pressures as a result of scrap copper suppliers&#8217; reducing available supply due to low prices.

We believe that being vertically integrated in copper manufacturing provides PC with an important competitive advantage and also provides our customers with the security of a continuous supply of wood preservatives. Likewise, we believe that our marketing, engineering, and technical support services provide added value to our customer base, who supply pressure-treated wood products to large retailers and independent lumber dealers. We believe another competitive advantage is provided by our strategic sourcing group who procure scrap copper and other raw materials, such as chromic acid, tebuconazole, arsenic trioxide, dispersants and various biocides and co-biocides through the global market. 

Equity Investments

Tangshan Koppers Kailuan Carbon Chemical Company (&#8220;TKK&#8221;) is a coal tar distillation facility located in China in the Hebei Province near the Jingtang Port. We hold a 30-percent investment in TKK. The Company is currently engaged in negotiations regarding the sale of our 30-percent interest in TKK to TKK&#8217;s controlling shareholder.

Research and Development

Research activities related to our CMC business are directed toward new product development regarding alternate uses for coal tar and technical service efforts to promote the use of creosote and vacuum-distilled carbon pitch.

PC&#8217;s global research group is located in the United States, with supplemental resources in the United Kingdom. We believe our investment in research and development keeps us on the leading edge of new technologies. The wood preserving intellectual property that the PC research group has developed and patented remains a very important part of our wood preservative portfolio. This intellectual property includes micronizing various chemical and additive formulations and the methods of treating wood with these formulations. In particular, one of our patented technologies, MicroPro&#174; wood preservative, has been adopted since its commercialization by many of our wood treating customers and the industry&#8217;s retailers and lumber dealers. The earliest expiration date for patents relating to micronized wood preservative compositions is April 9, 2024.

Expenditures for research and development were $5.2 million, $3.4 million and $2.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Technology and Licensing

In 1988, we acquired the &#8220;Koppers&#8221; trademark from Koppers Company, Inc. The association of the name with the chemical, building, wood preservation and coke industries is beneficial to our company, as it represents long-standing, high quality products. Trademarks relating to our wood preservation business, such as &#8220;MicroPro&#174;&#8221;, &#8220;Protim&#8221; and &#8220;Solignum&#8221; are important in this segment of our business, and as long as we continue to use the name &#8220;Koppers&#8221; and the trademarks associated with our wood preservation business and comply with applicable registration requirements, our 

right to use the name &#8220;Koppers&#8221; and the other trademarks should continue without expiration. The expiration of other trademark rights is not expected to materially affect our busine ss. 

Backlog

Generally, Koppers does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Inventory and production levels are typically driven by expectations of future demand based on contractual obligations.

Seasonality

Demand for residential, commercial, and agricultural treated lumber may decline during winter months due to weather conditions. As a result, operating results may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the severity of weather conditions and other variables affecting our products.
