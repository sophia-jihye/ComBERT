 Item 1. BUSINESS General 

Smith Micro provides software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience. As a leader in wireless connectivity, our applications ensure high quality of service for mobile users while optimizing networks for wireless service providers and enterprises. Using our intelligent device software, along with premium voice, video and messaging applications, we create new opportunities to engage consumers and monetize mobile services. In addition to wireless solutions, Smith Micro develops 2D/3D graphics software used by professional artists, animators, illustrators, and designers worldwide. 

Smith Micro&#146;s mission is to help our customers thrive in a connected world. Over the past three decades, we have developed deep expertise in embedded software for mobile devices, policy-based management platforms, and highly-scalable client and server applications. Our wireless software is used by Tier 1 mobile network operators, cable providers, and device manufacturers, as well as enterprise companies across a wide range of industries, helping these businesses capitalize on the growth of connected consumers and the Internet of Things (&#147;IoT&#148;). Specifically, we help our customers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; optimize networks, reduce operational costs, and deliver &#147;best-connected&#148; user experiences; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; manage mobile devices over the air for maximum performance, efficiency and reliability; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide greater insight into user experience to improve service quality and customer loyalty; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; engage and grow high-value relationships with their customers using smartphones. We continue to innovate and evolve our business to take advantage of industry trends and emerging markets, such as &#147;Big Data&#148; analytics, the explosion of Wi-Fi hotspots, and business-to-consumer (&#147;B2C&#148;) mobile marketing and advertising. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technology innovation, but a never-ending focus on customer value.

Business Segments 

Our business is focused on two industry segments: Wireless and Graphics. We do not separately allocate operating expenses, nor do we allocate specific assets to these segments. Therefore, segment information reported includes only revenues and cost of revenues. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to our business segments and geographical information. 

Wireless 

The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts, from the growing expanse of Wi-Fi and cellular networks, to the vast array of connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content consumed by users who want information and entertainment anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being &#147;connected&#148; in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the Internet of Things is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. In addition, pervasive connectivity has changed the way business operates on small and grand scales. For example, Wi-Fi hotspots are being deployed by neighborhood bookstores to keep customers on premise longer and by large sports arenas to support real-time video feeds into social networks and online broadcasts. Retailers are now spending more than 50% of their advertising budgets on mobile media, and targeting for those advertisements is driven by &#147;Big Data&#148; initiatives that collect consumer information from virtually every online or mobile interaction. 

&#160;

Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also many challenges: 

&#160;

&#160; &#045; &#160; Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses. &#160;

&#160; &#045; &#160; Mobile Network Operators (&#147;MNO&#148;) are being marginalized by over-the-top messaging applications and face growing competitive pressure from Cable/Multiple Service Operators (&#147;MSO&#148;) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users. &#160;

&#160; &#045; &#160; Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile securely and cost-effectively. &#160;

&#160; &#045; &#160; Consumers - frustrated by slow, congested networks and inconsistent device/app behavior &#150; seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while continually pushing for faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services. To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers multi-platform, modular solutions organized into three product families: 

NetWise &#174; &#150; The NetWise policy-on-device platform takes our connectivity and control capabilities to new heights. For mobile network operators, NetWise helps reduce cellular congestion and optimize data traffic across 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi networks. NetWise also provides critical insights into user experience from the device perspective, helping operators to improve service quality, which increases customer loyalty and retention. For cable/fixed line providers deploying Wi-Fi networks, NetWise facilitates Wi-Fi on-boarding with streamlined discovery and secure authentication to hotspots, while managing Wi-Fi Quality of Service. Beyond the benefits of improving network connectivity, NetWise can be used by service providers and enterprises to enhance mobile marketing to consumers. As more and more marketing tactics shift to mobile, NetWise offers retailers, brands, banks, and other B2C companies a better way to engage smartphone users with more personalized, context-based offers and services. 

CommSuite &#174; &#150; CommSuite allows operators and enterprises to deliver and monetize premium voice, messaging, and video services over mobile devices. CommSuite gives operators new ways to grow revenue through convenient, innovative voice features, such as Visual Voicemail, Voice-to-Text transcription, and animated Avatar messaging. CommSuite&#146;s flexible design and deployment methods support many business models, including &#147;freemium&#148; try-and-buy offers, monthly subscriptions, content purchases, and ad-sponsored services. CommSuite also enables efficient, high-performance streaming of mobile video content for entertainment, hospitality, large venues, and other industries. 

QuickLink &#174; &#150; Our QuickLink connection managers have shipped on more than 100 million devices worldwide, forming the foundation of our heritage as the leader in mobile connectivity. Many of the world&#146;s largest mobile network operators, including AT&#38;T, Bell Canada, Orange, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone, have deployed QuickLink as a white-label connection management application to their subscribers. QuickLink components are embedded by leading chipset manufacturers and module makers to ensure that connectivity is consistent across device types. QuickLink is also used by enterprises and public sector organizations with mobile workforces to provide enhanced security and configurability over public and private wireless networks. 

Through our broad software portfolio, Smith Micro offers exceptional expertise in mobile platforms, integration to operator networks, and wireless industry standards. Our powerful efficient on-device expert system and analytics are the perfect complements to the &#147;Big Data&#148; and mobile marketing initiatives driving most customer acquisition and loyalty programs today. Further, our ability to customize solutions and accelerate time to market for mobile services, while meeting stringent reliability and security requirements, makes us a leading choice for any company that wants to deliver more with mobile. 

&#160;

Graphics 

The Graphics (formerly Productivity &#38; Graphics) group develops a variety of software, including graphic design and animation, and compression and PC/Mac utilities, for consumers, professional artists, and educators. These products are available through direct sales on Smith Micro websites (smithmicro.com, mysmithmicro.com and contentparadise.com), as well as through affiliate websites, resellers, and retail outlets.

Because of our broad product portfolio, deep integration experience, and flexible business models, we can quickly bring to market innovative solutions that support our customers&#146; needs to create new revenue opportunities and differentiate their products and services among their competitors. 

Our marketing and sales strategy is as follows: 

Leverage Operator and OEM Relationships. We continue to capitalize on our strong relationships with the world&#146;s leading mobile network operators, multiple service operators, and device manufacturers. These customers serve as our primary distribution channel, providing access to hundreds of millions of end users around the world. 

Focus on High-Growth Markets. We continue to focus on mobile marketing, analytics/Big Data, premium messaging services, and wireless connectivity taking advantage of expanding 4G and Wi-Fi networks, as well as the explosive growth of smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices. 

Expand our Customer Base. In addition to growing business with current customers, we are increasing penetration of the enterprise market, with particular focus on large B2C companies, such as retail, brands, banking, and hospitality, as well as industrial IoT companies deploying connected devices. 

Key Revenue Contributors 

Revenues to Sprint and their respective affiliates in the Wireless business segment accounted for 65.4% of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the fiscal year 2015. Revenues to FastSpring in the Graphics (formerly Productivity &#38; Graphics) business segment accounted for 11.3% of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the fiscal year 2015. Revenues to Sprint and their respective affiliates in the Wireless business segment accounted for 68.0% of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the fiscal year 2014. Revenues to FastSpring in the Graphics business segment accounted for 11.2% of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the fiscal year 2014. In 2013, our two largest customers (Sprint and Verizon Wireless) accounted for 53.1% and 13.0%, respectively, of our total revenues. Revenue to FastSpring in the Graphics business segment accounted for 11.4% of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the fiscal year 2013. Our major customers could reduce their orders of our products in favor of a competitor&#146;s product or for any other reason. The loss of any of our major customers or decisions by a significant customer to substantially reduce purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160;

Customer Service and Technical Support 

We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, via email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their own technical support personnel. 

Product Development 

The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space. Research and development expenditures amounted to $13.9 million, $14.2 million, and $21.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Manufacturing 

Although we primarily deliver our software via electronic downloads, we do deliver our software in several other forms. We offer a package or kit that may include CD-ROMs and certain other documentation or marketing material. We also permit selected OEM customers to duplicate our products on their own CD-ROMs, USB devices, or embedded devices, and pay a royalty based on usage. Some OEM business requires that we provide a CD, which includes a soft copy of a user guide. Finally, we grant licenses to certain OEM customers that enable those customers to preload a copy of our software onto a personal computer. With the enterprise sales program, we offer site licenses under which a corporate user is allowed to distribute copies of the software to users within their corporate sites. 

Our product development group produces a product master for each product that is then duplicated and packaged into products by the manufacturing organization. All product components are purchased by our personnel in our Aliso Viejo, California facility. Our manufacturing is subcontracted to outside vendors and includes the replication of CD-ROMs and the printing of documentation materials. Assembly of the final package is completed by our Aliso Viejo, California facility. 

Competition 

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to enter the market. We will not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, we will also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel. 

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price of our products could negatively affect our profitability. 

Many existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. These customers may discontinue the purchase of our products. Our future performance is substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than design and develop their own software. 

&#160;

Proprietary Rights and Licenses 

Our success and ability to compete is dependent upon our software code base, our programming methodologies and our other intellectual properties. To protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, patents, copyright and trademark law that may afford only limited protection. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 92 issued U.S. patents and have 2 U.S. patent applications that are currently pending. These patents are intended to provide generalized protection of our intellectual property technology base and we will continue to apply for various patents and trademarks in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property technology base. 

We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code. The deterrent steps that we have taken to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or prevent the successful assertion of any adverse claim against us relating to software or intellectual property utilized by us. In addition, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce those rights. 

In selling our products, we primarily rely on &#147;shrink wrap&#148; licenses that are not signed by licensees and may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, the means we currently use to protect and enforce all of our proprietary rights and intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop competitive technology similar to ours. We also license technology on a non-exclusive basis from several companies for inclusion in our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to continue to license these technologies or to license other necessary technologies for inclusion in our products, or such third party technologies become subject to claims directed to or against the third party technologies used by us, or if we experience substantial increases in royalty payments under these third party licenses, our business could be materially and adversely affected. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 191 employees within the following departments: 119 in engineering, 38 in sales and marketing, 15 in operations and customer support, and 19 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
