 Item 1. 

BUSINESS 

Materion Corporation (our, we, or the Company), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is an integrated producer of high performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical, electronic, thermal, and structural applications. Our products are sold into numerous end markets, including consumer electronics, industrial components, medical, automotive electronics, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, and science. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 2,450 employees. 

Our businesses are organized under three reportable segments: Performance Alloys and Composites, Advanced Materials, and Other. The Precision Coatings group, which includes the Precision Optics and Large Area Coatings businesses, is included in the Other segment. The Other reportable segment also includes unallocated corporate costs. 

The cost of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper can be quite volatile. The Company's pricing policy is to directly pass the cost of these metals on to the customer in order to mitigate the impact of metal price volatility on the results from operations. Trends and comparisons of net sales are affected by movements in the market prices of these metals, but changes in net sales due to metal price movements may not directly impact our profitability. 

Internally, management reviews net sales on a value-added basis. Value-added sales is a non-GAAP measure that removes the impact of pass-through metal costs from net sales. Value-added sales allows management to assess the impact of differences in net sales between periods, segments, or markets and analyze the resulting margins and profitability without the distortion of the movements in the pass-through metal values. The dollar amount of gross margin and operating profit is not affected by the value-added sales calculation. The Company sells other metals and materials that are not considered direct pass-throughs, and these costs are not deducted from net sales when calculating value-added sales. 

&#32;Beginning with the first quarter of 2013, the Company reported value-added sales and margins externally. By presenting information on net sales and value-added sales, it is the Company's intention to allow users of its financial statements to review net sales with and without the impact of the pass-through metals. Refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a reconciliation of net sales to value-added sales.

PERFORMANCE ALLOYS AND COMPOSITES 

The Performance Alloys and Composites segment is comprised of the following operating units: 

Performance Metals &#32;produces strip and bulk form alloy products, beryllium-based metals, beryllium and aluminum metal matrix composites, in rod, sheet, foil, and a variety of customized forms, beryllia ceramics, and bulk metallic glass materials at manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The segment also operates the world's largest bertrandite ore mine and refinery in Utah, providing feedstock hydroxide for its beryllium business and external sale. 

&#8226; 

Strip products , the largest of the product families, include thin gauge precision strip and thin diameter rod and wire. These copper and nickel alloys provide a combination of high conductivity, high reliability, and formability for use as connectors, contacts, switches, relays, shielding, and bearings. Major end markets for strip products include consumer electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, automotive electronics, appliance, and medical. Performance Metals strip product form competes with strip from many companies around the world that produce alloys with similar properties as beryllium and non-beryllium-containing alloys. Key competitors include NGK Insulators, Global Brass and Copper, Inc.; Wieland Electric, Inc.; Aurubis Stolberg GmbH, Diehl Metall Stiftung &#38; Co. KG; Nippon Mining, and PMX Industries, Inc. 

&#8226; 

Bulk products &#32;are copper and nickel-based alloys manufactured in plate, rod, bar, tube, and other customized forms that, depending upon the application, may provide superior strength, corrosion or wear resistance, thermal conductivity, or lubricity. While the majority of bulk products contain beryllium, a growing portion of bulk products' net sales is from non-beryllium-containing alloys as a result of product diversification efforts. Applications for bulk products 

include oil and gas drilling and production components, bearings, bushings, welding rods, plastic mold tooling, and undersea telecommunications housing equipment. Major end markets for bulk products include industrial components, commercial aerospace, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Performance Metals' bulk products compete with companies around the world that produce alloys with similar properties. Key competitors include NGK Insulators, International Beryllium Corp., Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. in China, Ulba Metallurgical JSC of Kazakhstan, Le Bronze Industriel, KME Germany AG &#38; Co. KG; Aurubis AG, MKM Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing GmbH, AMPCO Metal, and Chuetsu Metal Works Ltd. Japan. 

Strip and bulk products are manufactured at facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania and are distributed internationally through a network of company-owned service centers and outside distributors and agents. Additional facilities are located in California, Arizona, and England. 

&#8226; 

Beryllium hydroxide &#32;is produced at our milling operations in Utah from our bertrandite mine and purchased beryl ore. The hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and, to a lesser extent, for beryllium products. Net sales of beryllium hydroxide to NGK Insulators, Ltd. from the Utah operations were approximately 5% of Performance Metals&#8217; total net sales in each of the three most recent years. 

&#8226; 

Beryllium products manufactures beryllium and aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs), beryllia ceramics, and bulk metallic glass materials. These materials are used in applications that require high stiffness and/or low density, and they tend to be premium-priced due to their unique combination of properties. Defense and science are the largest markets for beryllium products, while other end markets served include industrial components, commercial aerospace, medical, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure. Products are also sold for acoustics, optical scanning, and performance automotive applications. While Performance Metals is the only domestic producer of metallic beryllium, it competes primarily with designs utilizing other materials including metals, MMCs, and organic composites. Our aluminum powder metal MMCs compete with DWA Aluminum Composites and cast MMCs made by Duralcan USA. Electronic components utilizing beryllia and alumina ceramics are used in the industrial components, medical, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, commercial aerospace, and science end markets. Direct competitors include American Beryllia Inc., CBL Ceramics Limited, and CoorsTek, Inc. Manufacturing facilities for beryllium products are located in Ohio, California, Arizona, and England. 

Technical Materials &#32;produces strip metal products with clad inlay and overlay metals, including precious and base metals electroplated systems, electron beam welded systems, contour profiled systems, and solder-coated metal systems. This operating unit is located in Lincoln, Rhode Island and shares service and distribution centers with Performance Metals in Europe and Asia. These specialty strip metal products provide a variety of thermal, electrical, or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material. Our cladding and plating capabilities allow for a precious metal or other base metal to be applied in continuous strip form only where it is needed, reducing the material cost to the customer, as well as providing design flexibility and performance. Major applications for these products include connectors, contacts, power lead frames, and semiconductors, while the largest end markets are automotive electronics and consumer electronics. The energy and medical end markets are smaller but offer further growth opportunities. Technical Materials' products are manufactured at our Lincoln, Rhode Island facility and are sold directly and through its sales representatives. Technical Materials' major competitors include Heraeus Inc., AMI Doduco, Inc., and other North American continuous strip and plating companies.

GENERAL 

Availability of Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials we use are aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. Ore reserve data can be found in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The availability of these raw materials, as well as other materials used by us, is adequate and generally not dependent on any one supplier. 

Patents and Licenses 

We own patents, patent applications, and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. While our rights under the patents and licenses are of some importance to our operations, our business is not materially dependent on any one patent or license or on all of our patents and licenses as a group. 

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the manufacture, processing, use, handling, storage, transport, treatment, emission, release, and disposal of substances and wastes used or generated in manufacturing. For decades we have operated our facilities under applicable standards of inplant and outplant emissions and releases. The inhalation of airborne beryllium particulate may present a health hazard to certain individuals. 

Standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and by other governmental and standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes 

to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.
