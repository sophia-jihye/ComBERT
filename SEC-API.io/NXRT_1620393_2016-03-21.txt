 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated on September 19, 2014, and intends to elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) beginning with its 2015 tax year. The Company is focused on &#8220;value-add&#8221; multifamily investments primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s business is conducted through NexPoint Residential Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. (the &#8220;OP&#8221;), the Company&#8217;s operating partnership. The Company holds all or a majority interest in its properties (the &#8220;Portfolio&#8221;) through the OP. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary, NexPoint Residential Trust Operating Partnership GP, LLC (the &#8220;OP GP&#8221;) is the sole general partner of the OP. The sole limited partner of the OP is the Company.

The Company began operations on March 31, 2015 as a result of the transfer and contribution by NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (&#8220;NHF&#8221;) of all but one of the multifamily properties owned by NHF through its subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC (&#8220;Freedom REIT&#8221;). We use the term &#8220;predecessor&#8221; to mean the carve-out business of Freedom REIT. On March 31, 2015, NHF distributed all of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock held by NHF to holders of NHF common shares. We refer to the distribution of our common stock by NHF as the &#8220;Spin-Off.&#8221;

We are externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P., (our &#8220;Adviser&#8221;), through an agreement dated March 16, 2015 (the &#8220;Advisory Agreement&#8221;), by and among the Company, the OP and our Adviser. Our Adviser conducts substantially all of our operations and provides asset management for our real estate investments. We will only have accounting employees while the Advisory Agreement is in effect. All of our investment decisions are made by our Adviser, subject to general oversight by our Adviser&#8217;s investment committee and our Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). Our Adviser is wholly owned by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. and is an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. (our &#8220;Sponsor&#8221; or &#8220;Highland&#8221;). Both are SEC-registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

The entities through which we own the properties in the Portfolio have entered into management agreements with BH Management Services, LLC (&#8220;BH&#8221;). Pursuant to these agreements, BH operates and leases the underlying properties in the Portfolio and provides construction management services. BH has significant experience operating and leasing multifamily properties, having begun business in 1993 and currently operating and leasing approximately 65,000 multifamily units across the country. The Company pays BH a management fee of approximately 3% of the monthly gross income from each property managed, as well as construction supervision fees and certain other fees. BH or its affiliates also have equity interests in substantially all of the properties in the Portfolio. Affiliates of BH own a portion of each property, with the exception of one, through joint venture arrangements.

At December 31, 2015, the Company owned 42 properties representing 13,155 units in eight states.

(1) 

Occupancy is calculated as the number of units occupied as of December 31 for the respective year, divided by the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.

&#160;

(2 ) 

Average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of the contractual rent for commenced leases as of December 31 for the respective year minus any tenant concessions over the term of the lease, divided by the number of units under commenced leases as of December 31 for the respective year.

&#160;

&#183; 

Renovations: In 2015, we completed full and partial renovations on 2,313 units at an average cost of $4,814 per renovated unit. Since inception, we have completed full and partial renovations on 2,643 units at an average cost of $4,728 per renovated unit that has been leased as of December 31, 2015. We have achieved average rent growth of 11.4%, or a $93 average monthly rental increase per unit, on all units renovated and leased as of December 31, 2015, resulting in a return on investment on capital expended on interior renovations of 21.5%. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Dividends: We declared dividends totaling $13.2 million in 2015, or $0.618 per share, equating to a 6.3% annualized yield based on our closing share price of $13.09 on December 31, 2015. On March 7, 2016, the Board declared a dividend of $0.206 per share, equating to a 6.3% annualized yield based on our closing share price of $13.01 on March 15, 2016. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders with a goal of maintaining a stable dividend and increasing the dividend when we believe it is prudent to do so. The Board ultimately has the final authority to determine and declare dividends. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Term Facility Financing: On August 5, 2015, in conjunction with the acquisition of the two properties in Arizona, we closed a $29.0 million equity bridge facility with Key Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bridge Facility&#8221;) that matures on August 4, 2016. We used the financing to close the $74.8 million opportunity, which we thought was priced attractively and accretive to our cost of capital. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Regatta Bay Refinance: On October 21, 2015, we successfully refinanced our $13.1 million, 4.85% fixed rate HUD loan on the Regatta Bay property located in Houston, Texas with a $14 .0 million, floating rate loan at 1.70% plus three-month LIBOR and a five-year term. We paid appro ximately $0.7 million in prepayment penalties but reduced our annual interest cost s by approximately $0.4 million (based on three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2015). We determined it was advantageous to refinance the HUD loan, which was assumed at the pu rchase of the Regatta Bay property, to obtain more attractive terms and additional flexibility not afforded by the existing loan. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Cash Position: At December 31, 2015, we had $63.1 million of cash on our balance sheet, of which $24.5 million was reserved for future renovations and $21.3 million for lender required escrows. We believe we have adequate cash on hand to meet our near term obligations, service our debt, pay distributions and make opportunistic acquisitions. 

Our Real Estate Portfolio

At December 31, 2015, the Company owned 42 properties representing 13,155 units in eight states. At December 31, 2015, the occupancy rate for the Portfolio was approximately 93.9% and the weighted average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit was $803. For additional information regarding our Portfolio, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221; and Notes 2, 3, 4, and 6 to our combined consolidated financial statements.

Our Business Objectives and Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to:

&#160;

&#183; 

deliver stable, attractive yields and long-term capital appreciation to our stockholders; 

&#160;

&#183; 

acquire multifamily properties in markets with attractive job growth and household formation fundamentals primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States; 

&#160;

&#183; 

acquire assets significantly below replacement costs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

implement a value-add program to increase returns to our stockholders; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

own assets that provide lifestyle amenities and upgraded living spaces to low and moderate income renters. 

We intend to accomplish these objectives by:

&#160;

&#183; 

Focusing on Acquiring Class B Properties in Our Core Markets. We will continue to seek opportunities to acquire Class B multifamily properties at prices that we believe represent significant discounts to replacement cost, provide potential for significant long-term value appreciation and that we expect will generate attractive yields for our stockholders. We will focus on these types of opportunities in our core markets, which we consider to be primarily major metropolitan areas in Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focusing on Multifamily Properties with a Value-Add Component. We will continue to seek opportunities to acquire multifamily properties that have a value-add component. Due to a lack of reinvestment by many prior owners, we believe these types of properties provide us the opportunity to make relatively modest capital expenditures that result in a significant increase in rents, thereby generating Net Operating Income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) growth, and thus higher yields and capital appreciation for our stockholders. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Prudently Using Leverage to Increase Stockholder Value. We will finance new property acquisitions at a target leverage level of approximately 60% loan-to-value. Given that we intend for the majority of our acquisitions to have a value-add component in the first three years of ownership, we will generally seek leverage with the optionality to refinance (such as floating rate debt). In the management team&#8217;s experience, this leverage strategy allows for the opportunity to maximize returns for our stockholders while providing maximum flexibility. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s investment approach combines its management team&#8217;s experience with a structure that emphasizes thorough market research, local market knowledge, underwriting discipline, and risk management in evaluating potential investments with a goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value.

&#160;

Acquisition and Operating Strategy 

We seek to find Class B multifamily properties that are priced at a significant discount to replacement cost. We believe that through the implementation of our value-add program we will be able to grow the NOI of these types of properties significantly in the first three years of ownership and thus these types of acquisitions will be accretive over the long-term to our FFO and AFFO (see definition of these non-GAAP measures in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; below). As we progress through the real estate cycle, finding these opportunities will become more difficult. However, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to acquisitions by only pursuing these types of opportunities. Our Adviser&#8217;s investment approach includes active and aggressive management of each property acquired. Our Adviser believes that active management is critical to creating value. Prior to the purchase of a property, BH and our Adviser will tour each property and develop a business strategy for the property. This will include a forecast of the action items to be taken and the capital needed to achieve the anticipated returns. Our Adviser will review such property-level business strategies quarterly to anticipate changes or opportunities in the market. In an effort to keep properties in compliance with our underwriting standards and management strategies, our Adviser will remain involved throughout the investment life cycle of each acquired property and will actively consult with BH throughout the holding period.

We may also allocate up to approximately 30% of our portfolio to investments in real estate-related debt, mezzanine and preferred equity and other securities in situations where the risk-return profile is more attractive than investments in common equity. This strategy would be designed to minimize potential losses during market downturns and maximize risk adjusted total returns to our stockholders in all market cycles.

Value-Add Strategy

We will continue to implement our value-add strategy at our properties where we believe we can achieve a significant increase in rents above what would otherwise be the case with purely organic market increases. Our value-add program has three components: 1) improvement of exteriors and common areas, 2) improvement of interiors, and 3) management and cost improvements. Renovations to the exteriors and common areas include repairing parking lots and sidewalks, painting buildings, replacing roofs, upgrading and modernizing leasing centers, pools, pool furniture, gyms and other common area amenities. Renovations to interiors includes replacing carpet with faux wood floors, replacing kitchen and bath counter tops with faux granite, installing stainless or black appliances, upgrading lighting and plumbing fixtures and replacing linoleum floors with tile. We expect the exterior renovations to improve tenant retention and to modestly drive rent and NOI growth. As of December 31, 2015, we have renovated the exteriors at substantially all of the properties in our Portfolio. We expect interior renovations to be the primary driver of rent and NOI growth at our properties. As of December 31, 2015, we have completed interior renovations on 2,643 units out of 13,155 total units with an average monthly rental increase per unit of $93 and an average cost of $4,728 per renovated unit that has been leased as of December 31, 2015. In cases where we believe rents will grow significantly in a market organically, we will implement the value-add program more strategically in order to capture significant rent and NOI growth without expending additional capital. Also, to the extent we believe rents at a property are maximized regardless of the level of additional renovations we provide on an interior, we may opt to not further renovate units at that property. As of December 31, 2015, we had $24.5 million in cash reserved for planned interior, exterior, and common area renovations, eliminating the need for us to raise additional capital in order to carry out our currently planned value-add program.

Disposition Strategy

In general, we intend to hold our multifamily properties for production of rental income. Economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time. From time to time, we may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period, particularly if we receive a bona fide unsolicited offer with attractive terms, if we have an upcoming liquidity need, such as a debt maturing, or if the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. When reviewing whether a sale is in the best interests of our stockholders, we take into consideration whether market conditions and asset positioning have maximized the value of the property to us and any potential adverse tax consequences of a sale. In some cases, we may determine that a particular market no longer fits within our business strategy and sell assets to exit that market.

Financing Strategy

We intend to use leverage in making our investments with an objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing liquidity to grow the Company. We are currently targeting total indebtedness of approximately 60-65% of our total enterprise value with a goal of reducing leverage to 50-55% over time through increasing the value of our properties and refinancing properties we intend to hold longer-term. However, we are not subject to any limitations on the amount of leverage we may use, and, accordingly, the amount of leverage we use may be significantly less or greater than what we currently anticipate. We currently are meeting our short-term liquidity needs through our cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations and borrowings under a $29.0 million bridge facility with Key Bank, N.A. We do not currently have a revolving line of credit but are reviewing options to do so in 2016 to give us additional access to liquidity and flexibility in our operations.

&#160;

When interest rates are high or financi ng is otherwise unavailable on a timely basis, we may purchase certain properties and other assets for cash with the intention of obtaining a loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. We will refinance properties during the term of a loan o nly under certain circumstances, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing mortgage, an existing mortgage matures, the value of the property has increased significantly and we can obtain more attractive terms throug h refinancing the property, or an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase such investment. 

We typically use floating rate debt with caps as opposed to using fixed rate debt. We believe this is a more sensible and flexible way to utilize leverage in our strategy as we attempt to increase the value of each property over the course of two to three years after acquisition through our value-add program. Fixed rate financing is typically more expensive and less flexible since there are typically high prepayment penalties, yield maintenance payments and/or defeasance penalties when refinancing fixed rate debt prior to maturity. To the extent we intend to hold a property longer-term, we will reassess the use of refinancing with fixed rate leverage.

Property Management Strategy

We seek to achieve long-term earnings growth through superior property management. To achieve this, we have partnered with BH to manage all of our properties as an external manager. In order to align our property manager&#8217;s interests with those of our stockholders, we have required BH (through affiliates) to co-invest in all but one of our properties (see &#8220;Joint Venture Strategy&#8221; below). We believe BH provides the following benefits:

&#160;

&#183; 

BH manages approximately 65,000 multifamily properties in 22 states and has managed multifamily communities for 23 years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH brings a scale of operations we could not otherwise achieve for approximately 3% of gross income, which is the contracted amount we pay for their property management services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH has current operations in all of our current and desired markets, allowing us greater scale when entering new markets or allowing us to make investments in non-core markets without making substantial investments on management infrastructure in those markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH has a construction management operation and has substantial experience in renovating Class B multifamily units. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH&#8217;s scale allows them to get highly competitive pricing as it pertains to the costs of our value-add program, increasing our return on investment for renovations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH helps us source and underwrite opportunities as well as assist in due diligence of properties prior to closing. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH assists in locating potential buyers for our properties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH&#8217;s size, scale and experience allows them to keep costs low and maximize rents and occupancy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

BH has proved successful in driving other revenue growth at properties they manage. 

Joint Venture Strategy

We enter into strategic joint venture opportunities with affiliates of our property manager in an effort to better align our unaffiliated property manager&#8217;s interests with those of our stockholders. We own all of our properties with the exception of one through joint venture arrangements with affiliates of BH. Also, equity from joint venture partners allows us to expand the number and size of our investments, allowing us to obtain a more diversified portfolio and participate in investments that we may otherwise have deemed disproportionately too large for our portfolio at the time of purchase. We anticipate using a similar structure for our acquisitions in the future, although our joint venture partner may invest less than has historically been the case going forward. Our joint venture arrangements allow us to earn fees for asset management, which offset portions of our general and administrative expenses. Our joint ventures are structured to limit our noncontrolling partners&#8217; rights to give us maximum control over each investment.

&#160;

Our Structure 

The following chart shows our ownership structure.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Adviser

We are externally managed by our Adviser pursuant to an advisory agreement we entered into with our Adviser on March 16, 2015. Our Adviser was organized on September 5, 2014 and is an affiliate of Highland. Our Adviser has contractual and fiduciary responsibilities to us and our stockholders as further described under &#8220;Our Advisory Agreement&#8221; below. The members of the Adviser&#8217;s management team are James Dondero, Brian Mitts, Matt McGraner, Matthew Goetz and Scott Ellington.

Our Adviser has also entered into a shared services agreement with Highland, pursuant to which Highland will provide research and operational support to our Adviser, including services in connection with the due diligence of actual or potential investments, the execution of investment transactions approved by our Adviser and certain back office and administrative services.

Our Advisory Agreement

Below is a summary of the terms of our Advisory Agreement:

Duties of Our Adviser . Our Advisory Agreement provides that our Adviser will manage our business and affairs in accordance with the policies and guidelines established by our Board and that our Adviser will be under the supervision of our Board. The agreement will require our Adviser to provide us with all services necessary or appropriate to conduct our business, including the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

locating, presenting and recommending to us real estate investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies, acquisition strategy and objectives, including our conflicts of interest policies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

structuring the terms and conditions of transactions pursuant to which acquisitions and dispositions of properties will be made; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

acquiring properties on our behalf in compliance with our invest ment objectives and strategies; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

arranging for the financing and refinancing of properties; 

&#160;

&#183; 

administering our bookkeeping and accounting functions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

serving as our consultant in connection with policy decisions to be made by our Board, managing our properties or causing our properties to be managed by another party; 

&#160;

&#183; 

monitoring our compliance with regulatory requirements, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, NYSE standards and Internal Revenue Code (&#8220;the Code&#8221;) standards to maintain our status as a REIT; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performing administrative services; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

rendering other services as our Board deems appropriate. 

Our Adviser is required to obtain the prior approval of our Board in connection with:

&#160;

&#183; 

any investment for which the portion of the consideration paid out of our equity equals or exceeds $50,000,000; 

&#160;

&#183; 

any investment that is inconsistent with the publicly disclosed investment guidelines as in effect from time to time, or, if none are then publicly disclosed, as otherwise adopted by the Board from time to time; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

any engagement of affiliated service providers on behalf of us or the OP, which engagement terms will be negotiated on an arm&#8217;s length basis. 

For these purposes, &#8220;equity&#8221; means our cash on hand, exclusive of the proceeds of any debt financing incurred or to be incurred in connection with the relevant investment.

Our Adviser will be prohibited from taking any action that, in its sole judgment, or in the sole judgment of our Board, made in good faith:

&#160;

&#183; 

would adversely affect our qualification as a REIT under the Code, unless the Board had determined that REIT qualification is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders; 

&#160;

&#183; 

would subject us to regulation under the 1940 Act, except to the extent that we and our Adviser have undertaken in the Advisory Agreement and our charter to comply with Section 15 of the 1940 Act in connection with the entry into, continuation of, or amendment of the Advisory Agreement or any advisory agreement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

is contrary to or inconsistent with our investment guidelines; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

would violate any law, rule, regulation or statement of policy of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over us or our shares of common stock, or otherwise not be permitted by our charter or bylaws. 

Management Fee . Our Advisory Agreement requires that we pay our Adviser an annual management fee of 1.00% of our Average Real Estate Assets. 

&#8220;Average Real Estate Assets&#8221; means the average of the aggregate book value of real estate assets before reserves for depreciation or other non-cash reserves, computed by taking the average of the book value of real estate assets at the end of each month (or partial month) (a) for which any fee under the Advisory Agreement is calculated or (b) during the year for which any expense reimbursement under the Advisory Agreement is calculated. Real estate assets is defined broadly in the Advisory Agreement to include, among other things, investments in real estate-related securities and mortgages and reserves for capital expenditures.

In calculating the management fee, we will categorize our Average Real Estate Assets into either &#8220;Contributed Assets&#8221; or &#8220;New Assets.&#8221; The Management Fee on Contributed Assets may not exceed $4.5 million in any calendar year. This cap is intended to limit the fees paid to our Adviser on the Contributed Assets following the Spin-Off to the fees that would have been paid by NHF to its adviser had the Spin-Off not occurred. The management fee on New Assets will not be subject to any maximum amount in any calendar year.

&#8220;Contributed Assets&#8221; means all of the real estate assets we owned upon the completion of the Spin-Off.

&#8220;New Assets&#8221; means all of the Average Real Estate Assets other than Contributed Assets.

&#160;

The management fee will be payable monthly in arrears in cash, unless our Adviser elects, in its sole discretion, to receive all or a portion of such fee in shares of our common stock, subject to the limitations set forth below under &#8220;&#8212;Limitations on Receiving Shares.&#8221; The number of shares issued to our Adviser as payment for the management fee will be equal to the dollar amount of the portion of such fee that is payable in shares divided by the volume-weighted average closing price of shares of our common stock for the ten trading d ays prior to the end of the month for which such fee will be paid, which we refer to as the fee VWAP. Our Adviser will compute each installment of the management fee as promptly as possible after the end of the month with respect to which such installment is payable. The accrued fees will be payable monthly as promptly as possible after the end of each month during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. A copy of the computations made by our Adviser to calculate such installment will thereafter, for inf ormational purposes only, promptly be delivered to our Board. 

Administrative Fee . Our Advisory Agreement will require that we pay our Adviser an annual administrative fee of 0.20% of the Average Real Estate Assets. 

In calculating the administrative fee, we will categorize our Average Real Estate Assets into either Contributed Assets or New Assets. The Administrative Fee on Contributed Assets may not exceed $890,000 in any calendar year. This cap is intended to limit the fees paid to our Adviser on the Contributed Assets following the Spin-Off to the fees that would have been paid by NHF to its adviser had the Spin-Off not occurred. The administrative fee on New Assets will not be subject to any maximum amount in any calendar year.

The administrative fee is payable monthly in arrears in cash, unless our Adviser elects, in its sole discretion, to receive all or a portion of such fee in shares of our common stock, subject to the limitations set forth below under &#8220;&#8212;Limitations on Receiving Shares.&#8221; The number of shares issued to our Adviser as payment for the administrative fee will be equal to the dollar amount of the portion of such fee that is payable in shares divided by the fee VWAP. Our Adviser will compute each installment of the administrative fee as promptly as possible after the end of each month with respect to which such installment is payable. The accrued fees will be payable monthly as promptly as possible after the end of each month during which the Advisory Agreement is in effect. A copy of the computations made by our Adviser to calculate such installment will thereafter, for informational purposes only, promptly be delivered to our board of directors.

Reimbursement of Expenses . Our Advisory Agreement requires that we reimburse our Adviser for all of its out-of-pocket expenses in performing its services, including legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other services performed by the Adviser that outside professionals or outside consultants would otherwise perform and will also pay our pro rata share of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of our Adviser required for our operations (&#8220;Adviser Operating Expenses&#8221;). Adviser Operating Expenses do not include expenses for the administrative services provided under the Advisory Agreement. We will also reimburse our Adviser for any and all expenses (other than underwriters&#8217; discounts) in connection with an offering, including, without limitation, legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees and other documented offering expenses. 

Our Adviser will prepare a statement documenting all expenses incurred during each month, and will deliver such statement to us within 15 business days after the end of each month. Such expenses will be reimbursed by us no later than the 15th business day immediately following the date of delivery of such statement of expenses to us. All expenses payable by us or reimbursable to our Adviser pursuant to the agreement will not be in amounts greater than those which would be payable to outside professionals or consultants engaged to perform such services pursuant to agreements negotiated on an arm&#8217;s length basis.

Reimbursement of Adviser Operating Expenses under the Advisory Agreement, administrative fees and the management fees paid to our Adviser will not exceed 1.5% of Average Real Estate Assets per calendar year (or part thereof that the Advisory Agreement is in effect (the &#8220;Expense Cap&#8221;)). The Expense Cap does not limit the reimbursement by the Company of expenses related to securities offerings paid by the Adviser. The Expense Cap also does not apply to legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with mergers and acquisitions, extraordinary litigation or other events outside the Company&#8217;s ordinary course of business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of real estate assets.

Term of the Advisory Agreement . The Advisory Agreement has a term of two years. After the initial two-year period, the Advisory Agreement shall continue in full force and effect so long as the Advisory Agreement is approved at least annually (a) by either the Company&#8217;s Board or by a &#8220;vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities&#8221; (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company and (b) in either event, by the vote of a majority of the directors who would not be &#8220;interested persons&#8221; (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Adviser or the Company, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, in accordance with Section 15 of the 1940 Act. 

&#160;

The Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without payment of any penalty, by vote of the Board or by a &#8220;vote of a majorit y the outstanding voting securities&#8221; (as defined in the 1940 Act), or by the Adviser, in each case on not more than 60 days&#8217; nor less than 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to the other party. The Advisory Agreement shall automatically and immediately terminat e in the event of its &#8220;assignment&#8221; (as defined in the 1940 Act). 

Amendment . The Advisory Agreement may only be amended, waived, discharged or terminated in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the amendment, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. Any amendment of the Advisory Agreement shall comply with and be approved in accordance with the requirements of Section 15 of the 1940 Act and any applicable rules thereunder, regardless of whether the 1940 Act is otherwise applicable to us. 

Limitations On Receiving Shares . The ability of our Adviser to receive shares of our common stock as payment for all or a portion of the management fee and administrative fee due under the terms of our Advisory Agreement will be subject to the following limitations: (a) the ownership of shares of common stock by our Adviser may not violate the ownership limitations set forth in our charter, after giving effect to any exception from such ownership limitations that our Board may grant to our Adviser or its affiliates; and (b) compliance with all applicable restrictions under the U.S. federal securities laws and the NYSE rules. To the extent that payment of any fee in shares of our common stock would result in a violation of the ownership limits set forth in our charter (taking into account any applicable waiver or any restrictions imposed under the U.S. federal securities laws or NYSE rules), all or a portion of such fee payable to our Adviser will be payable in cash to the extent necessary to avoid such violation. 

Registration Rights . We entered into a registration rights agreement with our Adviser with respect to any shares of our common stock that our Adviser receives as payment for any fees owed under our Advisory Agreement. These registration rights will require us to file a registration statement with respect to such shares. We agreed to pay all of the expenses relating to registering these securities. The costs associated with registering these securities will not be deducted from the compensation owed to our Adviser. 

Liability and Indemnification of Adviser . Under the Advisory Agreement, we are also required to indemnify our Adviser and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding with respect to certain of our Adviser&#8217;s acts or omissions. 

Other Activities of Adviser and its Affiliates . Our Adviser and its affiliates expect to engage in other business ventures, and as a result, their resources will not be dedicated exclusively to our business. However, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser will be required to devote sufficient resources to our administration to discharge its obligations. 

Potential Acquisition of our Adviser . Many REITs which are listed on a national stock exchange are considered &#8220;self-managed,&#8221; since the employees of such REITs perform all significant management functions. In contrast, REITs that are not self-managed, like us, typically engage a third party, such as our Adviser, to perform management functions on its behalf. Our independent directors may determine that we should become self-managed through the acquisition of our Adviser, which we refer to as an internalization transaction. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;If we internalize our management functions, the percentage of our outstanding common stock owned by our other stockholders could be reduced, and we could incur other significant costs associated with being self-managed.&#8221; 

Our Property Manager

The entities through which we own the properties in our Portfolio have entered into management agreements with BH. Pursuant to these agreements, BH will operate and lease the underlying properties in the Portfolio. In addition to property management and leasing services, BH may also provide us with market research, acquisition advice, a pipeline of investment opportunities and construction management services. We will utilize BH for property and construction management services and leasing, paying BH a management fee of approximately 3% of the monthly gross income from each property managed, as well as construction supervision fees and certain other fees described under &#8220;Property Management Agreements&#8221; below. BH or its affiliates have an equity interest in or right to receive a share of distributions from substantially all of the properties in the Portfolio. See &#8220;Joint Venture Strategy&#8221; below for additional information.

Property Management Agreements

Under these agreements, BH will operate, coordinate and supervise the ordinary and usual business and affairs pertaining to the operation, maintenance, leasing, licensing, and management of each property. The following summarizes the terms of the management agreements.

&#160;

Term . The terms of the management agreements will continue until the last day of the calendar month following the second anniversary of the a greement. Upon the expiration of the original term, the agreements will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis until terminated. The agreements may be terminated at any time with 60 days written notice. 

Proposed Management Plans . Each management agreement requires that BH prepare and submit a proposed management plan and operating budget for the marketing, operation, repair and maintenance, and renovation of the property for the year the agreement is entered into. BH must submit subsequent proposed management plans 45 days prior to the beginning of the next year. 

Amounts Payable under the Management Agreements . The entities that own the properties will pay BH monthly for its services. Pursuant to the management agreements, BH may pay itself out of each property&#8217;s operating account. Any sums not paid within 10 days after becoming due will bear interest at the rate of 18% per annum. Compensation under the management agreements consists of the following components: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Management Fee . The management fee will be approximately 3% of the monthly gross income from each property. For the purposes of calculating the management fee, &#8220;monthly gross income&#8221; is defined as all receipts of every kind and nature actually collected from the operation of the property, determined on a cash basis, including, without limitation, rental or lease payments, late charges, service charges, forfeited security deposits, proceeds of vending machine collections, resident utility payment collections, and all other forms of miscellaneous income (but excluding the collection of any insurance or condemnation awards). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Set-Up/Inspection Fees . BH will receive a one-time set-up/inspection fee per unit upon commencement of management of each property. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Construction Supervision Fee . BH will receive a construction supervision fee of 5-6% of total project costs if BH performs these services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Renter&#8217;s Insurance Program Fee; Other Fees . In the event that the entities that own the properties direct BH to implement a renter&#8217;s insurance program at a property, the entities will pay BH a fee in connection with running such program. In consideration for any additional services other than the services required under the management agreements, the entities will pay BH an hourly rate. 

Additionally, the management agreements will require that the entities reimburse BH for certain costs incurred in operating and leasing the properties.

Termination . A management agreement will terminate automatically in the event that the entity that owns the property is sold or if all or substantially all of the property to which the agreement applies is otherwise disposed of. Additionally, a management agreement may be terminated if certain other events occur, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

a default by BH or the entity that owns the property that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods; 

&#160;

&#183; 

upon written notice by either party if a petition for bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement is filed by the other party, or if any such petition shall be filed against the other party and is not dismissed within 60 days of the date of such filing, or in the event the other party shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or take advantage of any insolvency statute or similar law; 

&#160;

&#183; 

upon 15 days written notice in the event that all or substantially all of the property is destroyed by a casualty, or taken by means of eminent domain or condemnation; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

upon 60 days written notice by either party. 

If a management agreement is terminated by the entity that owns the property for any reason other than a default by BH, or if it is terminated by BH due to our default or due to the destruction, condemnation or taking by eminent domain of a property, the entity that owns the property will be required to pay damages to BH. Such damages will be equal to the management fee earned by BH for the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the notice of termination is given, multiplied by the number of months and/or portions thereof remaining from the termination date until the end of the initial term or term year in which the termination occurred.

Additionally, for the month or the partial month after the date of the termination of BH&#8217;s on-site property management responsibilities, BH will be paid a close-out management fee equivalent to 50% of the last month&#8217;s full management fee.

&#160;

Insurance . The entities that own the properties will be required to maintain property and liability insurance for each property, and its liability insurance policy must include BH as an &#8220;Additional Insur ed.&#8221; BH will be required to maintain, at the entities&#8217; expense, workers&#8217; compensation insurance covering all employees of BH employed in, on, or about each property so as to provide statutory benefits required by state and federal laws. 

Assignment . BH may not assign the management agreements without the prior written consent of the entities that own the properties. 

Indemnification . The entities that own the properties will be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless BH and its agents and employees from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and/or expenses arising out of (1) BH&#8217;s performance under the management agreements, or (2) facts, occurrences, or matters first arising before the date of the management agreements. The entities that own the properties will not be required to indemnify BH against damages or expenses suffered as a result of the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud on the part of BH, its agents, or employees. 

BH will be required to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the entities that own the properties and their agents and employees from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and/or expenses arising out of the gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud on the part of BH, its agents, or employees, and shall at its own cost and expense defend any action or proceeding against us arising therefrom.

Regulation

Multifamily properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, such as swimming pools, activity centers, and recreational facilities. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.

Americans with Disabilities Act

The properties in the Portfolio must comply with Title III of the ADA, to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.

Fair Housing Act

The Fair Housing Act, its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women and people securing custody of children under 18) or handicap (disability) and, in some states, financial capability or other bases. A failure to comply with these laws in our operations could result in litigation, fines, penalties or other adverse claims, or could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. We believe that we operate our properties in substantial compliance with the Fair Housing Act.

&#160;

Environmental Ma tters 

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.

Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments at all of the properties in the Portfolio using the American Society for Testing and Materials, or ASTM, Standard E 1527-05, or Standard E 1527-00. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a report that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the assessed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the site assessments identified any known past or present contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or operations. However, the assessments are limited in scope and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties, or operations and conditions at nearby properties, may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. Moreover, conditions identified in environmental assessments that did not appear material at that time, may in the future result in material liability.

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of hazardous materials in building materials (e.g., asbestos and lead), and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing hazardous materials properly manage and maintain certain hazardous materials, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with certain hazardous materials, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if certain hazardous materials would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, the properties in the Portfolio are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements.

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.

The cost of future environmental compliance may materially and adversely affect us. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;We may face high costs associated with the investigation or remediation of environmental contamination, including asbestos, lead-based paint, chemical vapor, subsurface contamination and mold growth.&#8221;

Insurance

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on the properties in the Portfolio, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement-cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. The majority of our property policies for all U.S. operating and development communities include coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the project. We will also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to 

&#160;

the properties in the Portfolio. We have obtained coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. These policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising fr om environmental conditions, acts of war or certain kinds of terrorist attacks) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such covera ge. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. In addition, for the properties in the Portfolio, we could self-insure certain portions of our insurance program and therefore, use our own funds to satisfy those limits. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management team, the prope rties in the Portfolio are adequately insured. 

Competition

In attracting and retaining residents to occupy the properties in the Portfolio, we compete with numerous other housing alternatives. The properties in the Portfolio compete directly with other rental apartments as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the sub-markets in which our properties are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location and property and quality and breadth of services and amenities. If our competitors offer leases at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates that the tenants of the properties in the Portfolio pay, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce rental rates below those currently charged or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when the tenants&#8217; leases expire.

The number of competitive properties relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease apartment units at our properties and on the rents we charge. In addition, we compete with numerous other investors for suitable properties. This competition affects our ability to acquire properties and the price that we pay in such acquisitions.

Employees

Our Adviser conducts substantially all of our operations and provides asset management for our real estate investments. We will only have accounting employees (as of December 31, 2015, [ &#183; ]) while the Advisory Agreement is in effect.
